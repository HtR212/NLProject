They kept backing and the bear kept  _  at them. As the two children were wearing  _  , the boy told his  _  to jump into the lake. But the bear  _  them into the lake and caught the girl by the life-jacket. The boy turned back and tried to pull his sister away from the bear. But that didn't work. Then the boy tried growling  _  at the bear.  _  by this, the bear let the girl go. The children scrambled ashore and ran up to the house with the bear  _  them. The children tried to get  into  the house through the front door but it was locked. With the bear right behind them, they ran out of the house. Each time it got too close, the boy stopped and growled, and each time the bear stopped coming at them, allowing the children to escape . Finally they succeeded in entering by the back door. They phoned the police station. Two policemen came and drove the bear away.",
