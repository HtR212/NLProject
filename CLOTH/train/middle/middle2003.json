    "article": "Last summer we went on an exciting trip to Sarawak in Malaysia, a part of the island of Borneo . Borneo is famous for its rainforest, which  _  427,500 square kilometers of the island. This rainforest is 130 million years old, making it one of the  _  rainforests in the world. When we were in Sarawak, we were lucky enough to go hiking  _  the jungle. In the jungle we came across many wild  _  . Our favorite animals were orangutans . We watched them swing  _  tree to tree. The graceful and gentle animals made us feel even closer to  _  . The  _  told us many stories of fantastic spitting cobras . He said that they were more  _  of us than we were of them! Another interesting feature of Sarawak is that there are many tribes , which still  _  in the rainforest today.  _  we visited one of these tribes, people there told us about their long history. We were really  _  in their stories and traditions. Besides, we also enjoyed their  _  , such as pansoh, which was chicken cooked in bamboo. In Sarawak, there are also rivers and many different birds.  _  , we didn't have time to visit Turtle Island. It's a wonderful place  which  you can swim in with the turtles. This holiday has been a life-changing  _  that we will never forget.",
