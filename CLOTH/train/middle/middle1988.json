They are one bathroom, one living  room, one kitchen and two bedrooms. I'm very happy now, for I have  _   own room in our tlat. My bedroom is my favorite room in our flat because I can be alone  in it. I can read books or draw pictures. I can also  listen to   music or play CDs there. I can use my  _   to send e-mails to my friends. My  _  favorite room is the kitchen. I love helping mother  _  the meals. She's a good cook. She's teaching me  _ to make many different kinds of dishes.  And I'm learning  _  very hard. I want to be a good cook when I grow up. I have more to tell you about my flat, but I have to stop. Because I have a lot of  _ to   do. let me tell you next time.",
