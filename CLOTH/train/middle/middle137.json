    "article": "My name is Penny. I started being a _ in a group called Kinds Camp in 1995. There were many _ kids in the camp. At that time. I was a street kid. I didn't know what to do _ one of the workers asked if I wanted to help in the camp. I really didn't know what to expect but I _ .\nThe first day was _ for me. I thought the kids might not like _ and I was afraid to talk with them. But to my surprise, they were very _ and smiled  at me. By the end of that day, I found _ working there. The kids didn't _ if I wore old clothes or I couldn't read well. They _ me for me the person not who my family were or how much money I had.\nVolunteering to help the disabled kids not only helped them but it _ helped me. It saved me from a road that might turn in the wrong direction. It _ me understand that no matter how bad your _ is there will always be someone else that has it much worse than you do. It gave me hope and made me find my place in the world. For that _ hem greatly.\nThank Kinds Camp for _ me a chance  to volunteer. I will keep on volunteering.",
