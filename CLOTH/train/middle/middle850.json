But where can they pull all their warm  _  ? In the past, each student would buy a big beautiful notebook and ask their classmates  to write  in it. But things are a bit  _  now. Grade 9 students use USB flash disk  instead of  notebooks. Some students are not good at Chinese. They can't use sweet words to show  _  they love their friends. But with the USB flash disk they can write, draw or even make cartoons for each other. One of the students said, \"I like USB flash disk because it  _  less than fifty yuan. And there is a lot of  _  for me to write in.\"But some students still like notebooks better. They say words in computers are cold. It is bad for their eyes to use computers  too much  . \"Though a notebook may have less space, I still choose one. A notebook can keep my classmates' handwriting which makes me  think  of them.\" said a boy. Which way will you choose to say goodbye to your classmates?",
