    "article": "In America, on school and work days, breakfast in most homes is often a hurried meal. Some people even don't have it in order to  get to  work or school on time. Others just stop at coffee shops for coffee. But on weekends,  _  are quite different. People usually get up late, so they have enough time to have a large breakfast. Lunch is just a  _  break from the day's work rather than a large, long meal. It usually lasts  only  half an hour or an hour, so family members do not have time to  _  home. Most people have a sandwich or a hamburger, and fruit or ice-cream for lunch.  _  people either take their lunches to work in the brown paper \"lunch bag\",  _  eat a sandwich at a fast food restaurant. Children  _  to bring the \"lunch box\". Dinner is the most  _  meal of the day in the USA. At this meal, most American families can sit down together. It is usually a hot, large meal and it is quite different from lunch.  _  usually cooked dinner for their families in the past. Nowadays, however, with more women working and as a result, men are doing more in the kitchen.",
