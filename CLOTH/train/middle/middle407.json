    "article": "I'm glad it's Sunday again. I can stay in bed  as long as  I like, drinking tea and read those thick newspapers that are brought by the newsboy through the letterbox at 8:30. In this way, I can catch up with all the  _  I haven't got time to read during my work time. When I  have read  the papers, I then prepare my bath. The Sunday morning bath is  the most pleasant  of the week. There's no need to hurry because there's no bus to  catch  and my friends are told not to call me up before noon on Sundays, so there is no danger of being troubled by the telephone.  How to  spend the afternoon after lunch is always a bit of problem. In summer I can go to the park and sit in a chair  watching  boys playing football, while in winter I sit in front of the fire and  fall asleep  when reading a book, sometimes I turn on the television and sleep through an old film. Then there's the evening ahead of me. Perhaps I'll call on some friends or go to the cinema  when there's  a new film I want to see or to town for a concert. Oh, there are  so many  pleasant ways of passing Sunday evenings. The only sad thing is that Monday morning is getting near.",
