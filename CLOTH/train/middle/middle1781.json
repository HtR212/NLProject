I think I need about 2,100 calories every day.  _  breakfast, I usually eat a piece of bread and some eggs and I drink a cup of milk. This gives me about 00 calories to  _  the day. I often have a big bowl of soup with noodles,  _  and a banana for lunch. I  _  love noodles. This meal  gives  me energy for the  _  and for a game of tennis after school.  _  dinner, I always have rice, meat and vegetables. I do not like hamburgers and Coke because they are very  _  in fat and  _  . I never eat chocolate, but sometimes I have cakes.  _  dinner, I take in about 70 calories. Later in the evening, I often have a snack. That means I take in  _  2,100 calories every day. I need to eat a lot of healthy food. It is  _  important to exercise every day.
