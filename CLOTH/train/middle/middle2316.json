He was waiting for anyone who would  _  him a coin or a cup of hot coffee. I asked my  _  to go over and hand this old man something. He  _  into my husband's face, smiled and said , \"  Thank you  .\" I felt so happy and I wished the old man could live  _  the cold night. I was sure to meet him again and find out how he was the next  _  , as I have to pass this way everyday. I did so the next evening, and he remember the  _  and camp up to my window and  _  at me. This time I offered him a  _  of food. He reached out for the bag and I gave him my hand. He  _  he food, smiled and said, \"May God bless you.\" I looked at the old man and he  _  me think of my father. I do hope all of us will remember that maybe one day, it could happen to one of us,  _  please do not pass by a  _  person without offering at least a word of love and a kind smile or an act of kindness of any kind.",
