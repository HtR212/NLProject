Just at that time, a young man came and shouted, \"Stop!\" The children ran  _  quickly. The turtle was very thankful and said, \"Thanks for your kindness. I really would like  to invite  you to a wonderful place now.\" The young man rode on the back of the turtle and was taken to the secret palace in the sea. When he  arrived at  the palace, he was very surprised and said to the turtle, \"What a nice palace!\" To thank him, the king of the turtles gave him a very  big dinner  . He had never seen such a dinner before. He received a warm welcome there and was very  pleased with  everything. After dinner, the king of the turtles said, \"I am going to give you two boxes,  _  you can open only one.\" \"You mustn't open both. Don't forget it!\" the turtle warned him. \"All right. I will open only one.\" The young man promised. At this time, a large wave sent him out of the sea. After he went back  home  , he opened the bigger one of the two boxes. To his surprise, the box was full of gold. \"My God!\" he cried, \"I'm  a rich man  now.\" Then he thought, \"Things in  the other  box must be valuable, too.\" He couldn't wait any longer. He broke his promise and opened the other box. As soon as he opened it, he became an old man. His hair turned white. His face  looked like  an old man over eighty years old. It all happened in a moment. He was sorry for what he did, but it was too late.",
