Here is a story of a man who did lots of bad things, but his promise to tell the truth _ him.\nOnce the man came to the prophet  Muhammad (S) and said, 'Oh prophet of Allah, I have many _ habits. Which one should I give up first?' The prophet said, 'Give up telling lies first and always speak the truth.' The man promised to do so and went home.\nAt night the man planned to go out to steal. Before _ home, he said to _ , 'If tomorrow the prophet asks me _ I have been, shall I say that I went out stealing? No, I can't say that. But neither can I lie. If I tell the truth, everyone will call me a _ .' So the man _ not to steal that night.\nNext day, when he was about to _ wine, he thought, ' _ shall I say to the prophet if he asks me what I did during the day? I cannot tell a lie, and if I speak the truth people will _ me, because a Muslim   is not _ to drink wine.' So he gave up the idea of drinking wine.\n _ this way, whenever the man thought of doing something bad, he _ remembered his promise to tell the truth. Step by step, he gave up all his bad habits and became a good Muslim and a very good person.",
