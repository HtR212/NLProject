They have  too much  homework to do both at school and at home. They have lots of exams  to take . And their parents usually take them _  different classes on weekends. As a result, so many teenagers almost become bookworms . On holidays, they could hardly have  their own  time to do the things they like. Now more and more teenagers are getting  short-sighted.
