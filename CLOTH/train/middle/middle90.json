The new traffic law is considered to be the strictest ever. Running a  _  light means six points deducted from your license. That's half of the 12-point limit. It used to be  _  three points for the same offense. There are some strict rules, too. For  _  , if the driver doesn't fasten the seatbelt , he or she will deducted two points from his or her license, For all the drivers who like drinking, there is a new rule especially  _  up for them. If the driver drives the car  _  drinking, he or she will be deducted twelve  _  from his or her license. When you lose all the 12 points, you have to  _  the license test again before you can get back behind the wheel. Across China, more than 60,000 people  _  in traffic accidents each year. That means every ten minutes, one person gets killed on the road. The government hopes the  _  traffic rules will help to make China's roads safer. Of course, we hope so.",
