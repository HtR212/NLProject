I listened as she was speaking to her make-believe little friend and I'll never forget the words she said, even though it was imagined.\nShe said, \"Suzie's in the corner because she's not been very _ . She didn't listen to a _ I said or do the things she should.\" In the _ , I saw her baby doll all dressed in lace and pink. It was _ she'd been put to sit alone and think.\nMy daughter _ her \"conversation\", as I sat down on the floor. She said, \"I'm all fed up. I just don't know _ to do with her any more. She cries whenever I have to work and wants to play games, too. She never lets me do the things that I just have to do. She tries to help me with the dishes, but her arms just cannot _ . And she doesn't know how to fold towels. I don't have the _ to teach. I have a lot of work to do and a big house to keep clean. I don't have the time to sit and play -- _ what I mean?\"\nAnd that day I thought a lot about making some _ in my life, as I listened to her words that cut me like a knife.

So, let the cobwebs   _ the corners and the dust bunny rabbit rule the floor. I'm not going to worry about keeping up with them anymore.\nI'm going to fill the house with _ of a child and her mother, for we are only one childhood, and we will never get another.",
