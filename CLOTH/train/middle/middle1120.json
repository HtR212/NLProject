Then he often met his old friends under a big tree. They had drinks there and talked  _  anything they liked. One day, some old men were sitting together again and talking about young people in this world. They all agreed that the old people were  cleverer  than young people. Then one of the old  _  said that young men were stronger than old men.  _  of them agreed that this was true,  _  Mr. Black didn't. He said, \"No. I am as strong now as when I was a young man.\" His friends were surprised  _  what he said. \"Well,\" said Mr. Black, \"Near my house there is a big stone. When I was a young man, I used  to try  to move it, but I couldn't because I was not  strong enough  . I am an old man now, and when I try to move it, I still  _  . So, I am as strong as when I was young.\"",
