    "article": "I have taught English in China for over six years.I think Chinese students work very  _ ,but the way they learn isn't the best. _  should focus on using what they already know.A lot of students seem to think they need to learn a large number of words or phrases  _  they are able to say what they want to say.Most of the time they don't;they just need to  _  the words they have learned more creatively.\nA lot of Chinese students have spent a  _  time learning English,but they haven't spent a long time  _  to use it.You don't need to go abroad  to use English.You can find  _  you like on the Internet in English--basketball,chess,dogs...I have met a lot of people from Europe who are  good at  English.They didn't spend hours learning from textbooks,and they didn't all go to the best schools.They regard English as a tool  _  having fun,socializing  and doing business--not just for passing exams.I suggest the students in China should spend more time using their English for pleasure --listening to  _ ,watching movies,reading news or whatever else they like to do.Whenever you use a skill,you'll improve it.",
