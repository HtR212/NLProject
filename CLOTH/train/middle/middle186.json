He  _  for the workman and asked him  _  he had the bill send to the company. \"Well ,\"the workman answered, \"you  _  the house we were repairing in New-bridge, don't you? One of the things we had to  _  there was to put  _  some new electric wiring . Well, in one place we had to pass some wires  _  a pipe thirty feet long and about an inch  _  ,which was built into stone and had four big bends in it. None of us could think how to do this until I had a good  _  . I went to a shop and  _  two white mice, one of them male and the other female. Then I  _  a thread to the body of the male mouse and put it into the pipe at one end,  _  Bill held the female mouse at the other end and  _  her gently to make her squeak ( ). When the male mouse heard the female mouse's squeaks, he rushed along the pipe to help her. I  _  he was a gentleman even though he was only a mouse. Anyway, as he ran through this pipe, he pulled the  thread  behind him. It was then quite  _  for us to tie the thread to the electric wires and pull them through the pipe.\" The manager paid the bill for the white mice.",
