    "article": "Dear Paul,\nHow _ your last weekend? I had a happy weekend. I _ a museum and learned a lot about mobile phones there. Do you know about smart mobile phones ? Now they are getting very _ . Lots of people are using them.\nMy brother is a university   student. He made some _ by doing part-time  jobs during his vacations. Last week, he _ a smart mobile phone. He spent over 3,000 yuan _ it. It is _ expensive, isn't it? My brother can do many things on it. He can not only play games, listen to music but also watch movies. He can read books and write e-mails. And he can study and work on it, too. It is really a small computer! I think it is cool. I wish to buy _ , too.\nDo you have a smart mobile phone? What do you think of it? Please write to me soon.\nYours,\nLiu Wei",
