    "article": "In America, the school day usually starts at 9a.m. and finishes at about 4 p.m. The school subjects _ different from ours. In China, we always  _  Chinese, math, English, P.E. and so on. But in America , students have more   _  , such as cooking and driving lessons. Their life isn't just    _  study . They have      _  things to do than the Chinese students do . There are many clubs in American schools, too. If the students are   _  in sports , they can join different sports clubs . American students also have art clubs ,language clubs and some   _  clubs. From 2:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. , they do   _  things in different clubs.\nMaybe you think English is very popular in the world, so American students don't need to learn any other language  _  that's not true. American kids from the age of seven   have to  learn a foreign language. For example ,they learn French or Chinese.",
