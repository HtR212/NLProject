Everyone  in my family took a bag  _  some food and water.  _  three hours, we got to the top. I was so tired that I wanted to have a rest.  _  the city looked wonderful from the top of the hill! Then we had our lunch at 1:00 p.m. .After a while, it  _  hardly, so everyone put a raincoat on. You  _  think we would feel sad. No. We  _  were excited, because we saw  quite a  wonderful waterfall in the mountain. It was so beautiful  _  we forgot about the last 3 hours. At 4 p.m., we came back to the foot of mountain. My father bought  some  tea for my grandparents. My mother bought a beautiful necklace for  _  . I didn't buy anything, because  _  there was too expensive, and I didn't have much money.",
