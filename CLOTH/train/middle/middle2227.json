    "article": "My favorite animals are elephants. Elephants are the biggest living animals on land. There are two kinds of elephants--African elephants and _ elephants. African elephants are larger than Indian elephants, and they have much larger ears.\nElephants have to eat a lot because they are so big. One elephant can eat between 100 _ 1,000 pounds _ grass in a day! They can live for 60--70 years. There are no bones in the back of _ feet, only fat. Elephants walk on tiptoe. They can move quietly and walk in the mud _ \nElephants grow tusks. The tusks are large teeth that stick out of _ mouths. Sometimes, hunters kill elephants to get the tusks. People use the tusks to make beautiful things and piano keys.",
