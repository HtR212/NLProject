I am  _  in a school now. I do well in all my subjects.  _  the teachers like me very much. My dream is  to be  a teacher in west China. Many children there want to go to school  _  they can't. Their families are poor and their parents don't have enough money  to send  their children to school. I think that going to school and studying is the only  _  to change their life. Teachers are  _  needed there, so I want to be a teacher to help them. I will be kind to my students and make  friends  with them. All the children  there  like to talk with me, too. I will give them love and teach them  _  to be a useful person. I think it is  _  interesting job in the world. I hope my dream can  come true  !",
