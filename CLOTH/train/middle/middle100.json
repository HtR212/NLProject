For instance, we should not hurt or bully others, nor should we litter. Rules often tell us what is right or wrong.\nRules can help the public make the right _ , and remain safe. Car drivers have to obey traffic regulations that tell them the right things to do on the road to avoid crashes. Cyclists who give signals before turning or stopping help prevent _ .\nIf people follow rules without taking other matters into consideration, it will be _ for them to form what is sometimes called a \"black and white\" view. For example, they may believe that people should always tell the truth, and that lying is _ acceptable. Such people always stick to their views, even if it means that they may get into trouble.\nSometimes it may not be so easy to know _ what is right or wrong. Some people choose not to eat meat because they believe that it is cruel to eat animals, but others argue that they can eat meat and _ be kind to animals; some insist that stealing is always wrong, but others think that one does not need to feel _ when stealing some food to eat, if lives in a really poor area and he is starving. Rules help us live together in harmony, because they show us the right way to  _ others.
