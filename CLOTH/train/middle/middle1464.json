I loved her the first time I saw her, _ a few days later we found that something was wrong. Zoe was really _ , so we had to take her to the animal hospital quickly.\nZoe got a serious illness, and I was scared that she wouldn't _ the pain. After a long time, Zoe came home from the hospital, but the illness damaged her _ . Zoe was deaf.\nI _ that I wouldn't let that change her life, so I began _ her sign languages so that she could learn orders. I helped _ to learn to sit, come, and do all the other things that dogs do.\nToday, Zoe is a happy four-year-old dog. We spend lots of time _ , for example, when I'm playing the piano, Zoe jumps up to try to play, too! I guess that part of loving a dog is looking after it. Play with it often, and find a way to train it. In return, your dog will give you so much love.",
