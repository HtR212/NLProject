And Mrs. Wang sometimes forgets to cook supper for the family. One summer they planned to  _  to New York for their holidays. They got to the airport only ten minutes  _  the plane took off. So time was short. But  _  Mrs. Wang said she must tell Lingling, their daughter, not to forget to  _  the front door when she went to school. But Lingling then was at school. They couldn't tell her about it by  _  . So they hurried to the post office. Mrs. Wang wrote a short  _  to Lingling, and Mr. Wang bought a  _  and an envelope. Soon the note was ready. They put the stamp on the envelope in a hurry and dropped it in the letter  _  , but suddenly Mrs. Wang began to cry. The short note was  _  in her hand. She had put the plane tickets in the envelope.",
