    "article": "Last week I read a report on a charity show. The aim of the show was to  _  money for the poor children who were out of school,  _  their families didn't have enough money for their children. Many famous pop stars  took part in  the charity show, such as Jackie Chan and Lin Junjie. The stars didn't  ask for  any pay . They did that for free. There were a lot of performances,  _  singing and dancing. The audience were  _  excited that they clapped their hands from time to time. Of course, the show was  _  All the people followed the  _  examples. They gave their money to the charity show. Both the ticket money and the donated money would be sent to the  _  areas and some of the children would get back to school. Now many charity shows are held in our country, not only to support education in poor areas  _  to help people in trouble. I hope the whole world become more and more beautiful with kind people's help.",
