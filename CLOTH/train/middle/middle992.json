It asks people to  turn off  their lights and other electrical appliances like computers for one hour. In this way, people can pay  _  attention to the climate change and know that it's important to save the earth. Earth Hour first  started  in Sydney in 2007. More cities around the world followed Sydney's lead in 2008.  _  March 28, 2009, 88 countries and more than 4,000 cities joined Earth Hour. From 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., Beijing, Dalian, Hangzhou, Hong Kong and many  other  cities in China took the action, too.  Thousands of  shops closed and people used candles at home. The UN said that it  would help  save the energy . The world seems to be a dark world  when  the lights are turned off. However, people are trying to do something to save the  _  in such beautiful \"dark moment\". This year, WWF encourages people to make a small change for the environment every day. Now,  _  you join us?",
