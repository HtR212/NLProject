There was a very old clock in his first house and when the men came to  _  his things to the new house for him. Peter thought, \"I'm going to let them carry my beautiful old clock in the truck. But maybe they'll  _  it and then it will be very  _  to repair.\" So he picked it up and began to carry it down the road in his arms. It was  _  so he stopped three times to have a rest. Then suddenly a small boy came along the  _  . He stopped and looked at Peter for a few  _  . Then he said to Peter, \"You are a  _  man, aren't you? Your clock is too old and too big. Why don't you buy a  _  like everyone else?\"",
