    "article": "\"Who did this?\" Mrs. Green asked with a piece of broken glass in her hand. She had never been so  _  with us. The classroom was so quiet. All students looked at the window except me. I kept my head  _  . I knew it was me. I broke it when I practiced  playing  baseball. But should I tell the truth? If I did, I would be in trouble, I didn't have enough  _  . How could I afford to buy such an expensive window? I really didn't want to put up my hand,  _  at last I said. \"I did it. I am sorry.\" It was not  _  for me to say those words. Mrs. Green went to the book shelf and took down a book. Then she walked to me. Looking at  _  , I was a little afraid. To my surprise, she said, \"I know you like  _  .Here is the book about them. It's yours now. I give it to you not because you broke the window, but because you are  _  .\" I couldn't believe it. I wasn't punished . However, I was given my favorite book about birds. It happened 20 years ago, but I still  _  the book. The lesson my teacher taught me that day will be in my heart forever.",
