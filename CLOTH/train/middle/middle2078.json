Suddenly, a young guard ran toward me and ordered me to  follow  him. I felt so upset and  _  . He took me to a small room, but I was  _  frightened that I stopped at the door. Finding me  _  to enter the room, he shouted that I had to go into the room. He closed the door. I thought he was going to hurt me. Suddenly, a  _  voice said in my ear: \"Take out the things you've stolen!\" \"I stole nothing.\" I said. \"Do as I tell you. If we find them, you'll be in trouble.\" \"There is nothing.\" I answered. \"I didn't take anything.\" I said, taking everything out of my pockets and bag.  _  this point, a guard came in and asked a salesgirl to  examine  me.  Needless to say  , they found nothing. But they didn't believe that I hadn't stolen anything. So the young guard ordered me to pass through the door alarm again. I was  _  when it rang again.
