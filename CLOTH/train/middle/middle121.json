What are you  _  about? You have nothing? That's not true! You have the most expensive things in the world,  _  you are a rich person.\" The young man was very surprised and asked, \" _  do you say that? You can see I have nothing. What are these expensive things?\" Then  _  old man said, \"If you sell your eyes to a rich blind man, you'll  _  a lot of money and can have everything you want. Would you like to sell them?\" The young man didn't want to be blind, so he said, \"NO.\" The old man asked again, \"Then what about  selling  your hands for some gold?\" The young man shook  his  _  for the second time. Finally, the old man said, \"Now you understand. You have the most expensive things in the world.\" So, the old man taught both the young man and us a lesson---  _  is the most important for us.",
