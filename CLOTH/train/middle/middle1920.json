    "article": "Christmas was coming and ten-year-old Tracy told her father and me that she wanted a new bike. Her bike was too  _  , and it needed repairing as well. As Christmas  came nearer  , her dream for a bike seemed to disappear , we thought, for she didn't say it again. We were busy  buying  some beautiful story books, a doll house, a holiday dress and toys. Then to our surprise, on December 24, she said she really wanted a bike more than  anything else  . Now we didn't know  _  to do. It was just too late. We were busy with Christmas dinner and packing  _  presents, parents' presents, a brother's present and friends' presents till midnight. So there was  no  time to take to buy the \"right bike\" for our little girl. Thinking we were parents who would make their child unhappy, we felt sorry and  _  . Suddenly my husband had an idea. \"What about making a little bike with clay and writing a note that she could trade in the model bike for a real one?\" So he spent the next five hours carefully  working  with clay to make a small bike.  _  Christmas morning, we were so excited for Tracy to open the little box with the beautiful red and white clay bike and the note. She opened and read the  _  loudly. She looked at me and said, \"So, does this mean I can trade in this bike for a real  _  ?\" Smiling, I said, \"Yes!\" Tracy had tears in her eyes when she replied, \"I would  never  trade in this beautiful bike Daddy made me. I  would rather  keep it than get a real bike. This is the best Christmas present  _  I have ever got in my life!\"",
