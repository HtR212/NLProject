    "article": "There are many different kinds of cars in the world. My aunt thinks that cars are  _  their drivers. She says, \"Rich people have expensive cars, big people have large cars, and old people drive old cars.\" But I don't  agree with  her. My neighbour, Mrs. Hill, is 82 years old. She drives only on Tuesday, and she drives only to the bank. She  _  drives more than 30 kilometres an hour. Do you think Mrs. Hill has a very  _  and small car? No, her car is new. It's very large, and it  can  go 200 kilometres for each hour! My friend is  an artist  . He draws beautiful pictures with lots of colors. But his car is black! Mrs. Bates has a very, very old one. There is often something  _  with the car. Does she drive that kind of car because she is poor? No, she has four factories and  two million  dollars in the bank. My aunt Mary has a ver  _  car, though she drives to the country with her husband, her two children, her mother and their dog. Now you have  read about  my friends and their cars. Do you agree with my aunt? Maybe you have a car. Does it say anything about you?",
