    "article": "I have never taken cooking classes. I learned cooking  _ my mother because she was really  _   in teaching me. Do you know why? When my brother got married, she didn't know anything about cooking. My grandmother never allowed her  to stay   in the kitchen.\nMy mother did not start to cook  _ she was twenty-five. At the beginning, it was very hard for her. So she had to take cooking classes to prepare our meals. After having that experience, she decided to teach me to do some cooking  _ she didn't want me to have the same experience.\nI remember when I was seven  _ old, I often stayed in the kitchen and watched her cook. I always helped her. Sometimes we prepared meals and my mother knew   how to make them, and sometimes we prepared them from recipes. Nowadays, I am really thankful for that experience. I don't need any help to cook a meal. I can cook for  _ or for a group of people. It doesn't matter.\nI will teach my children and I don't want them to have the same experience   _ my mother. If one day I am not with them, I want to be sure that they can also eat well.",
