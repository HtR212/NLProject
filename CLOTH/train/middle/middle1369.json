But autumn is my  _  season now. Summer is too hot, so I always  _  in the house. I  _  like it. Winter is usually too  _  . I don't like to go outside and I have to wear lots of warm clothes. In spring it usually rains. It's my second favorite season. Autumn is the best. It isn't too hot  _  too cold. The temperature is  _  18degCand 22degC. It's a great time of the year. I like it.",
