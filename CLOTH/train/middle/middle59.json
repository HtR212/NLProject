    "article": "Dear Peter, I hope everything is going well with you ! I'm glad  to receive  your letter asking for my  _  on how to learn Chinese well. Here are  a few  suggestions. Firstly, you can take part  _  a Chinese course. There you can learn from the teachers and practice with your classmates as possible as you can. Secondly,  _  is important to read some newspapers about  _  and watch Chinese TV programs whenever possible. Besides, it is also a good idea  to learn  and sing Chinese songs, it can improve your oral Chinese and by  _  so, you'll learn and remember Chinese words  more easily  I think  the best way  to improve your Chinese is by making more Chinese friends. You can chat and do something  _  them together.  _  you want to learn it, they will tell you a lot about China and help you learn Chinese. I believe you can learn Chinese  _  . Try  to write  to me in Chinese next time. Good luck to you! Best  _  ! Yours, Li Hua",
