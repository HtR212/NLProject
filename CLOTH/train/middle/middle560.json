Boys needed an education to be  _  in Ancient Egyptian culture. When they were young, boys learned skills  _  their fathers. They learned to fish, hunt, and work in the family's fields. As a boy grew, his father would decide what type of education he would  _  . For some of the poorer boys,  _  he could learn was his father's trade.  _  , some fathers wanted their sons to have a better life. But, this was very costly. School  wasn't built  by the government. So if a boy was going to learn  _  else than his father's trade, there was a fee. If he could afford the fee, a father had two main chances: an apprenticeship or school. Artisans and craftsmen offered apprenticeships to boys. A father would pay a fee to have his son  _  special skills. During an apprenticeship, a boy worked beside the tradesman to learn from him. Apprenticeships lasted for many years.",
