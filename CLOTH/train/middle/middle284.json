Suddenly I ran to my mother and said, \"Tony fell from the open window!\" She was very  _  and ran out of the kitchen. Then I said, \"Don't worry. I'm just  _  .\" And my mother shouted at me, \"If you do it  _  , I'll hit you.\" One day I went swimming with my  _  in the sea. I wanted to play a joke on them. In the beginning, I went swimming  _  , and I called out, \"Help!\" All my friends came to help me, only to  _  that I was joking. But the next time I wasn't joking. I was so  _  that I swam in deep water. I tried my best to call my friends for help, but this time nobody came to help me.  In the end  , they found I was telling the truth. They came and saved my life. They took me to the hospital. This is the best  _  in my life. From then on, I haven't joked on anyone.",
