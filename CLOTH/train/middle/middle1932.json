Antarctica is the _ and windiest place in the world, even colder and windier than the Arctic. In summer, the sun shines for twenty-four hours a day. _ in winter, it's completely dark for about three months. Very _  plants grow there, but there is some wildlife, like sea lions and penguins  .\nWhen Captain James Cook traveled around Antarctica by ship in the 1770s , he found nobody living there. Today, a few _ are studying the Ozone Hole   in Antarctica. The ozone layer   is getting thinner and thinner. The biggest \"hole\" is over Antarctica, and the _  there is becoming warmer. These scientists are thinking about ways to _ Antarctica. Maybe they will find some useful methods soon.",
