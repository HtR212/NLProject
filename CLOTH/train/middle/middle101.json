If you're not sure,review the events that led up to the fight.If your _ is wrong,don't apologize  .You probably didn't do anything wrong! So give your friend the _ shoulder.Wait until they say they are sorry! And if they don't apologize, they're not worth  your _ ! You can spend the time with other friends.",
