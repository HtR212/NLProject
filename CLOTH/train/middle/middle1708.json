    "article": "What's your idea about success? Some people say that beginners have all the luck, while others believe that success  _  only with practice. In fact, I feel both of these statements are not true all the time. Each is true in some ways  _  not in others. For example, I went to a drawing competition many years ago and  _  surprisingly. As a prize, I got a film ticket to see \"Titanic\". I was really  _  because it was the first time I had taken part in any competition, Thinking that I might be lucky again, I  _  joining in other art competitions, But the result was that I  _  won again. I accepted the fact that the other people had a  greater  artistic ability than I did. Art was not something I was especially interested in and I had never practiced the different art skills. So, the  _  I produced were not of a very high standard . These experiences taught me a lot. Though I might have been lucky  at first  , I also need to put in hard work. As we know,  _  makes perfect. So I believe success builds on less luck and chance.",
