He wanted to _ a cup of tea and some eggs. Soon the waiter came up to him, and asked, \"Can I help you?\" \"A cup of tea and...\" he could not remember the _ word for eggs. He looked _ him, but nobody was eating eggs. Then he _ a picture-book on the table next to him. There was a picture of a cock on _ cover . He _ the picture to the waiter. \"What's this _ English?\" he asked. \"A cock,\" answered the waiter. \"What do you call a cock's wife?\" he asked again. \"A hen.\" \"And what do you call a hen's children?\" \"Chicks.\" \"And what do you call chicks _ they're born?\" \"Eggs.\"\n\"Very well,\" said the French student happily. \"Bring me two eggs and a cup of tea, please.\" And he sat down _ a smile on his face.",
