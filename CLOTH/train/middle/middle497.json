I am studying at a boarding school, so I have to learn  not only  how to study well, but how to get on well with others. Some of us are  _  while others are quiet. So it is  _  that people have problems and arguments. Smiling at others is the easiest way to stop argument. Another way is to think  _  your ideas are right before having an argument. If others' ideas are really not good, keep and open  _  . Try to forgive them. Having a friend is  much  better than having an enemy after all. Also,  _  point out others' mistakes  in public  . If you really want to help them, send a letter  instead  . On the other hand, if someone points out your disadvantages, don't  _  . Just think this is a person who really wants to help you and make friends  _  you. Remember: Forgiving makes life  _  .",
