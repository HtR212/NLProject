    "article": "Dear Editor , I'm writing to ask what has happened to the young people. They are not so polite, hardworking  _  clever. I'll give you an example. Last Friday, I got on the bus  _  9:00 am. It was very busy so there were no free  _  . There were some teenagers  sitting  on the seats near me. I don't know  _  they weren't at school. They were talking loudly and laughing. It was difficult  to read  my newspaper. An old woman with a little girl got on at the next stop,  _  lots of shopping bags. I asked the teenagers to let them sit down. They  slowly  did so but gave me an unfriendly look. I worried about the  _  of our country. They sit around McDonald's after school instead of going to the library like I did at their age. Maybe they have  too much  money. Perhaps another reader can give us an idea about what to do with these teenagers. Thomas",
