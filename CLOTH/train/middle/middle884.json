You may try to find out  _  the book you want is. But if you can't find it, the assistant will lead you there and then he will go away. It seems that he is  not interested in  selling books at all. A story tells us about a good bookshop. A young student  _  a very useful book in the bookshop.  _  it was too expensive for him. He couldn't get it from the library, either. So every afternoon, he went there to  _  a little at a time. One day, however, he couldn't find  the book  from its usual place and was leaving when he saw an assistant signing to him. To his surprise, the assistant pointed to the book in the desk , \"I put it there  because  I don't want other people to buy it,\" said the assistant. Then he  _  the student go on with his reading.",
