    "article": "Farley worked for the Canadian government. One day, he was  _  to learn more about wolves. Do wolves kill lots of caribou ? Do they kill people? They gave him lots of food and clothes and guns. Then they put him on a plane and took him to  a far place  . The plane put him down and went away. There were no houses or people in this place. But there were lots of animals and lots of wolves. People tell terrible stories about wolves. They say wolves like to kill and eat people. Farley remembered these stories, and he was  _  . He had his gun with him  all the time  . Then one day, he saw a group of wolves. There was a mother wolf with four baby wolves. A father wolf and another young wolf lived with them. Farley watched these wolves every day. The mother was a very  _  mother. She gave milk to her babies. She gave them lessons about life. They learned how to  _  food. The father wolf got food for the mother. The young wolf  played with  the children. They were a nice, happy family--wolf family! Farley did not need his  _  any more. In a short time, he got on well with the family. Farley watched them for five months. He learned that many stories about the wolves were  not true  . Wolves do not eat people, and they do not eat many large animals. And he also learned bad things about men. It was men who killed many caribou and wolves. Later, Farley wrote a book about wolves. He wanted people to  _  them and not to kill them.",
