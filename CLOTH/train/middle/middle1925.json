The robots in the movies are usually stronger, faster and  cleverer  than people. In real life, most robots are used in factories. They can do lots of dangerous, difficult or  _  jobs. Some people can't look  _  themselves and robots can help them. For example, some people can't see, and they use a guide dog to help themselves move. But now scientists are  _  a robot to help them. Robots are also used in American hospitals. At one hospital, a robot  _  meals from the kitchen to the sick people's rooms. It never loses its  _  because it has a map of the hospital in its computer system .  _  the future, robots will even work in space. But robots will  _  take the place of people but only work for people. They can, however, help us in a lot of different ways.",
