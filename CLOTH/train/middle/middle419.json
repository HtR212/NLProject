    "article": "My dad was a fisherman,and he loved the sea. He had a boat,but it was  _  to make a living on the sea. He worked hard and stayed out  _  he caught enough fish for the family. When the weather was  _  , my father didn't work,and he drove me to school. Before he left,he would give me a big kiss on the face  _  tell me to be a good boy. It was so embarrassing for me. I remembered the day. I was 12 years old. I thought I was too old for a good-bye kiss. We got to school and came to a stop. He had his usual big smile and started to kiss  _  before he left, but I put my hand up and said,\"No,dad. \"It was the  _  time that I talked to him in that way. and he felt very surprised . I said,\"Dad,I'm too old for a good-bye kiss. I'm too old for any kind of kiss. \"My dad looked at me  _  a long time, and his eyes were filled with tears. I never saw him  _  . \"You are right,\"he said,\"You are a big boy...a  _  . I won't kiss you any more.\" It wasn't long after that when my dad went to the sea and never came back. I was so sad that I wanted one more  _  from my father.",
