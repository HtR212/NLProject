When I was doing nothing, Mr. Gough, our new English teacher,  walked into the classroom.\nTo my surprise, he held up a book, TheCollected Works of Edgar Allan Poe, and asked \"Who had read it yet? \". I put my hand up, because Poe was my favorite writer. Mr. Gough asked if I really understood _ the author tried to say in his book. My reply made him smile, and he asked me to write an essay on that subject.\nAfter that, English classes became a new interest for me. Mr. Gough thought that students had to act out a play to understand it. \"Don't just read it, \"he said.\nAs time passed, we developed a real friendship. He encouraged me to be a _ in the future. When I left school, he said to me, \"You have a gift for writing, Tony, and one day you'll come to realize how _ it is. Make use of it if you want your life to be complete . \"\n Years has passed. Now every time I sit down to write something new , I think of Mr. Gough. He was more than just an English teacher, because he also taught me useful lessons in life.",
