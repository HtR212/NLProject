Then the earth  _  terribly and many houses  _  down. Railway tracks break and trains go off lines. A great many factories are destroyed. Thousands of deaths are caused, and many more lose homes. Besides the great damage and deaths caused by the earthquake  _  ,other accidents such as fires often  _  . More buildings are destroyed and more deaths caused. It is well-known of th  _  of an earthquake, and for centuries man has been making researches on earthquakes. More than 2,000 years ago,  for example  ,a Chinese scientist named Zhang Heng invented a machine which could  find out  from which direction the seismic waves had come, and this machine is still  _  by scientists today. Now we know much more about earthquakes and  _  they happen, but we still can't tell exactly when and where earthquake will happen, and cannot stop it from happening.",
