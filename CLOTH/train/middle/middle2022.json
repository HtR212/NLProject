    "article": "Many people go to school for education.They learn languages,history,geography, physics , chemistry and math.Others go to school to learn a skill  so that  they can make a living. School education is very important and useful,but no one can learn  _  from school. A teacher,no matter how much he knows,can't teach his students everything they want to know. The teacher's.job is to show his students how to read and  _  to think.So much more is to be learned out of school  _  students themselves. It is always more important to know how to study by oneself than to memorize some  _  or formulas .It is actually quite  _  to learn a certain fact in history or a formula in mathematics.But it is very difficult to use a formula in working out a math problem. Great scientists such as Einstein,Newton and Galileo,didn't learn many things from school, but they were all  _  and invented many things for mankind. The  _  for their success is that they knew how to study.They read books that were not  _  at school . They worked hard all their lives  _  not a single minute . They would ask many questions as they read and they did thousands of experiments.",
