    "article": "Dear dad, Happy birthday to you! On this special day, I'd like to tell you in a special way. I don't think I'm good at telling you my thought face to face with you, so I'm  _  to show my deep love for you. You are not a rich man  or  a famous person. But in my heart, you are one of the greatest  _  in the world. I am  proud of  you. You are  _  interested in being famous and rich. You do  _  things like paying for your phone on time, and working as a worker in your factory. The smile on your face shows you are pleased with the family. You take good care of my grandparents. You help me with my schoolwork and do some shopping with mom on Sundays. In the past, I didn't care  _  you were with me or not. Now I am sorry  to say  I didn't realize you before. But I am thankful for what you have done for me. I am quite lucky that I have  _  a great father. And I feel happy that now I can let you know  how much  I love you. You are successful as a son, a husband, a father and a friend. Love from, Lydia",
