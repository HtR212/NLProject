It picked  a leaf  off a tree and threw  _  into the water in front of the bee. The bee climbed  _  the leaf, and it was brought  _  to the land. The bee thanked the bird a lot and then  flew away  . Not  long after  that, the bird was sitting  _  the branch of a tree. It did not know that a man was shooting at it. But the bee saw  _  the man was doing. So it flew into the man's  _  and stung him. The  _  in the man's eye was so great that he was not able to  shoot  the bird, and the bird flew away.  In this way  ,the bee,  _  life had been saved by the bird, was able to save the life of the bird.",
