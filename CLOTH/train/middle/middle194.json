One way was wide and clean. There were  lots of  flowers on both sides.  The other  way was narrow and dirty. Wild grass grew everywhere. But finally I decided to follow the dirty way. Ah! There was a small  _  there. It was the most beautiful garden I had ever seen. There were lots of trees, flowers and chairs. I thought it was  the best  part in the park. Many people  _  me that there was nothing to see in the park. Now I tell them  _  they follow the right way, they can feel the difference. When I'm telling them,  _  just smile at me without answering. I know they don't believe me. My trip to the park that day made me understand something about  _  . Don't be  _  to choose a different way. Be brave . You may get a big surprise!",
