Go to the village and bring me a fat pig.\" \"Oh, Tiger,\" says the monkey. \" I  _  do that. There  _  another tiger over there. He also wants a fat pig. He will not let me do anything  _  you. I am afraid of him.\" \"What?\" cries the tiger. \"Show  _  that tiger. I will talk to him.\" \"Come  _  me, then.\" Says the monkey. The monkey and the tiger get to a bridge above the river. \"Now look down  _  the river.\" Says the monkey. \"Do you  see  the head, the white teeth and large green eyes of a tiger?\" \"Yes, I do,\" cries the old tiger. \"I will eat him up.\" With these words the tiger  jumps into  the river.",
