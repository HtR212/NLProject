Even though I'm not always a good kid, my dad  _  shouts or gets angry with me. I know that he's  waiting for  --a day when I grow up and understand things in my life. I can see the reason that he is so positive is because he believes in  _  . And he believes that whatever  _  , it is under control. So we have nothing to worry about. Be positive!",
