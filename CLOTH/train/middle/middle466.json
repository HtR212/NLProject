    "article": "My tears run down when I talk to my parents on the phone. What are they doing when I  call  them? Dad works from 7a.m to 9p.m. Mum does all the  farm work  . She also has to work in the vineyard . But I can't do  _  for them. Every day she got up earlier than Dad. When I  _  call her at 7:30 in the evening, she is still working and  isn't having  supper. How hard it is for a daughter to stop the  _  in heart! And even harder to keep back the tears.  _  only thing I can do is to promise her that I'll study hard in the university. I also  _  her to take care of herself and dad. I can not live  _  them. Mum says the happiest time for dad and  _  is when my sister and I return home. We play  _  in the room, watch TV or do anything we like, with dad  _  mum cooking together in the kitchen. It is  _  the happiest time for me. I've never thought my holidays at home could be so  _  . I wanted to do more housework because mum really needs more rest. Love, sometimes, doesn't need too many  _  . We may be too shy to say the warm word out. Then give them a call and tell them you miss them.",
