    "article": "Dear Peter,\nSchool is going well. I am so _ and I have little time to go out and play _ the weekend. I always go to the library to _ newspapers or study English.\nIf you have time, you can come to _ me. You can go straight down Centre Street. _ you see Blue Bar, just turn left. The name of my apartment   is Victor. That's easy to _ . I like my house. It isn't very big _ it's a nice home. If you come to my house, we can watch movies and we can _ Chinese food. I'm often at home after 7 pm, and I go to bed at around 10:30 pm every day because I have to go to school early the next morning. You can give me a _ before you come. Hope to see you soon.\nYour best friend,\nLinda",
