    "article": "That was a normal, busy morning .John, an elderly gentleman, arrived at the hospital I work at to see his doctor. John told me that he was in a hurry  _  he had to be somewhere else at 9:15 am. I invited him to take a  _  in the waiting area. There were many patients that morning. It would be over an hour  _  he could see the doctor. I saw him  looking at  his watch worriedly, so I decided to deal with his wound myself since I wasn't busy at that time. While taking care of his wound I asked John if he had  _  appointment this morning. John told me no, but he needed to go to eat breakfast with his  _  at Christopher's Nursing Home. As we talked, I asked if his wife would be  _  if he was a little late. John replied that she could no longer know  _  he was, and had been like that for five years. I was surprised and asked him, \"Do you  _  go there every morning, even though she doesn't know who you are?\" He smiled and said, \"She doesn't know  _  , but I still know who she is.\" I had to hold back tears as John left, and thought, \"That's the kind of love I want in my life.\"",
