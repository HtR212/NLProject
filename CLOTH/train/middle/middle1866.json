I knew I had to get to the hospital to tell him how much I loved him. As I drove to the hospital, I pictured him before I got to tell him how much he  _  to me. Trying to fight back the tears, I wanted to stay calm when I saw him.  _  I got to the hospital, I hurriedly looked for his hospital room. I found him in a semi-conscious state . On my knees, I said softly, \"Hello, Grandpa.\" Still feeling shy, I  _  not to leave his bedside without letting him know. While I asked about how he was, he told me, \"I'll be fine, Henry.\" although we both knew that wasn't  _  . Then he asked me with a smile  _  I was doing. Hearing what my grandpa said, I was much  _  . I made the decision that I had to show my gratitude for him. As I found all the courage I had, I hold his hand tightly. I  _  out, \"Grandpa. I just want to let you know how much I love you. I hope you already know that yet I just want to make sure.\" By this time, tears were rolling down my face. All those years of love that I had shut and not let him know, became  _  . Smilingly, he said, \"I know. Thank you for telling me that. All I have on this planet is my family and my love for  _  . If there is anything I could ask of you, I want you to be good to your family, your mother, your father, and your brother. That's all I want of you.\" What I learned that day  _  my whole life. From then on, I began telling people how much I love them, care for them, and respect them. I get in touch with, for example, my babysitter, my barber, to  _  my appreciation. I go down into the city once a week and serve pizza to the homeless. I wake up every morning and list everything I'm thankful to in my life.",
