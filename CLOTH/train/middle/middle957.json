At last, I became very angry and ran to my father. He listened to me  _  . Then he asked, \"Are these things true or not? Do you know what you are really like? Go and make a  _  of what she said and find the  _  that are true.\" I did he told me. To my great  _  . I discovered that about half of the things were true. Some of them I couldn't change(like being very thin). But there were things I could and wanted to change. For the  _  time, I got a clear  _  of myself. I brought the list back to dad. He refused to take it. \"That's just for you.\" He said. \"You know the truth about  _  better than anyone else. When people say something that is true about you, you should find it helpful.\" Our world is full of people who think they know your business. Don't  _  and feel  _  . Listen to them.",
