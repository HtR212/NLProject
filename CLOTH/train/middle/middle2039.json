    "article": "One day I got into a taxi in a hurry and we left for the airport .\nWe were _ on the right way when suddenly a black jeep jumped out of a parking space right in front of _ . The driver had to stop the taxi at once, and almost hit another _ .\nThe man in the car turned his head around quickly and started shouting _ us. My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. I think the taxi driver was really _  . So I asked, \"Why did you just do that? That guy almost broke your car and sent us to the hospital! \" This is _ my taxi driver taught me--The Law of the Rubbish Truck.\nHe explained that many people are like rubbish trucks . They run around full of rubbish, full of _ , full of stress and full of disappointment . And their rubbish will get more _ they find a place to empty it and sometimes they'll empty it onto you . Don't take it _ . Just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on . Don't take their rubbish and _  it to other people at work, at home, or on the streets.\nLife's too short, so why not be nice to others and ourselves?",
