    "article": "There is an old saying: \"Take the time to stop and smell the flowers.\" I think we should also take the time to  _  flowers.\nMy grandmother knew just  _  to do that. She grew flowers with earth, water and love, so her back garden was filled with beautiful flowers. She would smile when she saw the  _  shine down on them. In her front garden she planted flowers,  _ . You could see red, white, and yellow flowers in it. My mom and I used to walk  _  them and enjoy their smells. Beautiful butterflies   flew down on them. Grandma also cared for the wild flowers. She would send  _  and my brother out to pick flowers and would then turn them into delicious wine  .\nGrandma not only planted flowers in the gardens  _  also planted flowers in our hearts. Her delicious dinners made with love encouraged us. Her sweet smile always made us  _ . Her hugs   and kisses were the sunshine that kept our own love  _  day after day.\nTake the time to plant a few flowers yourself today. Show your smiles, kindness and love. Plant your wishes, talents and pleasure. Make this  _  brighter and brighter with your sunshine.",
