He often  _  us jokes and  stories  to make our class more  _  . In class, he is a very  _  teacher. If we don't listen to him carefully, he will give us some punishment by  _  us some questions. But after class, he becomes a very good  _  of us. He often talks with the girls and plays  basketball  with the boys. All of us really like him. He is our  favorite  teacher.",
