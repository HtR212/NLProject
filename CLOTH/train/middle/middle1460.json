    "article": "If you want to do your homework right after school, you may eat something before getting to work. Never try to work when you are very  _  . Always do your homework before you get too tired. Don't wait  _  late in the evening, or the homework will seem  much harder  than it really is. Divide your time into a few parts if you have more than  an hour's  work. Have a short rest every forty minutes. However, don't divide up your time  _  short to do anything. You should be able to work at least half an hour at a time without  _  . Don't  put off  doing your homework until the last minutes. Or you will have it on your mind and you won't  _  your free time. If you put off until the end of the week or even before a test, you will have too much  to do  . What's more, you will have a fear of tests and cannon get a good result. Do your homework at the same time every day. This will help you make it a  _  -----part of your daily work. Then it will make your free time more enjoyable.",
