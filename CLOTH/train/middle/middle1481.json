Jeff is my classmate. We are in the  _  class. We often help each other. I teach him English and he  teaches  me Chinese. Now, I can talk with them  _  Chinese. Sometimes I learn  _  to make Chinese food. Hmm! How much I like Chinese food! My school is not  _  . I go there on foot. I have six classes  every day  . After school, I play games with my classmates. I have a very good time here . I think you can come here when you are free. Please write soon! Love  _  Jim",
