All of them have to sleep   _ because there aren't any houses or hotels. They usually choose  _    really useful like a toothbrush since they can only  _  one thing with them. The people also have to find food by themselves. So they need to spend a lot of time fishing and collecting fruit from the  _   . Every week one person has to  _    . At the end, there are only two people on the island and one of them is chose  _   the winner.\nI really like Survivor because it's very  _   and the people have to do things like hunting for food. I really  _   myself when I watch it. I don't want to be on the show, however, I like living in a house!",
