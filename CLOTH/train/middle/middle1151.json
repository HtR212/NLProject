    "article": "After I got up, I ran to my computer. It's the most  _  thing for me. But I found it  _  there. \"Where is my computer?\" I looked  _  it everywhere. Dad came in and said angrily, \"Your computer? I sold it  _  you spent too much time playing games. You  _  go out and look at the world. Try  to live  a life without the computer. OK?\" Then I walked into the  _  and saw some people  _  kites. I felt relaxed and thought, \"I played basketball  _  in the park every afternoon with my classmates before,  _  now I always sit  in front of  the computer doing nothing useful.\" Suddenly, I felt the ground was shaking. I didn't know what was wrong. \"  _  up, Tom. It's 7 o'clock now. It's time to go to  _  . You should have classes today.\" I opened my eyes and knew I was still in bed. I hurried to my desk and saw my  computer  was still there. But I didn't feel excited and said to myself, \" From now on, I will live a  _  life--away from the computer.",
