    "article": "On a cold November afternoon, my mother and I were walking back home from a pizza store. We had bought many things. I was feeling a little _ as I was carrying our shopping bag, so I decided to throw something away. I noticed a poor man walking out of the restaurant in front of us _ I was walking towards a dustbin . He headed over to the nearby dustbin and started looking through it.\nI suddenly felt very _ because I was about to throw away a new drink just because it was too heavy. I walked up to him and handed the _ and some bread over to him. The man looked up in surprise and took what I gave him. A huge smile _ on his face. I felt I couldn't be happier with _ . But then he said, \"Wow, this is my son's lucky day!\"\nWith that, he _ me happily and started off on his bike. I _ heard him singing as he rode away. I got a warm _ inside. I now understand what it means by the saying \"Giving is getting\".",
