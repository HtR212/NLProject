Then we waited for the ants to arrive.\nAfter the ants in the glass farm, they started to make tunnels. I was  _  that each one knew exactly what to do. Each had  _ own job.\nOn the fifth day a tragedy happened. I put face to close to the glass farm. When I knocked it over. All the tunnels fell down. Although the ants remained alive after their earthquake, one by one they began to die. I was scared as I watched them give up  building their tunnels to carry the bodies to a corner of the farm. My mother said that the ants were dying of _  . They simply couldn't stand that their tunnels were gone, although much time has passed. I still  _  that ant farm. Mom had hoped it would teach me about natural world, but it   taught me much more.\nOver the years, I came to realize the importance of  teamwork . Working together, the ants were able to make an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired  for their hard work.\nBut there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently. Adversity  is a natural part of life and must be accepted . Unlike the ants, we can't give up when we are sad. We have to realize that if a tunnel is gone.
