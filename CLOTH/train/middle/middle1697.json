Well, I think _ favourite festival is National Day.\nWhy do I like the festival? _ I don't have classes for a week. And I don't have _ homework to do. It usually takes me two days to do my homework and then my parents usually take me to see my grandparents and cousins. They all live _ Beijing and we don't have many chances  to see _ other. My grandparents always cook nice food for us when we're in Beijing. I can play games with my cousins. Sometimes we _ about our school lives and our classmates. We can also buy some gifts like books, toys and model planes. We usually take many nice pictures there.\nWe usually stay in Beijing for about 5 days and then we go back home with a happy feeling. We _ have a good time during the long holiday!",
