I saw two boxes at the corner, but I remembered they weren't there  _  . Maybe someone just put them there while I was  _  the bags. I took out my  _  and tried to open the apartment door, but the key didn't work. There were  _  keys on the desk when I got out of the apartment. I just took one of them and the other one was left there. Maybe I took the  _  key.  _  looked the same and that was quite possible. When I was  _  again, a woman opened the door. She asked me if I needed any help. You could imagine how  _  I was. What was she doing in my apartment? Then I saw a new doorbell, and everything in the house looked different. Then I realized that I had  _  into the wrong building. I said sorry to the  _  and left. Later I found that my apartment was the one in front of it.",
