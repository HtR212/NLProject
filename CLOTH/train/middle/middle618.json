But people throw rubbish out of their _ when driving on the roads. I think that will destroy the beauty.\nI _ pick up rubbish near our house with my two children. My daughters often say to me in a happy _ , \"There is some rubbish, Daddy. _ the car.\" And then we will pull the car over and pick it up. It may seem strange, but we _ it. We pick up rubbish in parks, on sidewalks, almost _ .\nOnce I saw a stranger  picking up rubbish like us. He smiled at me and said, \"I _ you do it, and it seemed like a good idea.\"\nPicking up litter is only one of the things we can do to _ others.

Things like these are _ but helpful.\nThese little acts of kindness can help you know how _ it feels to be kind and helpful.",
