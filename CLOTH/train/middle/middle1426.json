He was a helpful man, so he went up to the woman and said, \"Let me give you a hand with that box. It looks very  _  .\" \"That's very kind of you,\" the woman said. \"I'm having a lot of  _  with it. I think it's struck .\" \"Together we'll soon move it,\" the man said. He  _  into the back seat of the car and took hold of the other end of the box. He said, \"I'm ready.\" And he began to  _  hard. For several minutes the man and the woman struggled with the box. Soon they were  _  in the face. \"Let's rest for a minute,\" the man said. \"I'm sorry, but it  _  stuck.\" A few minutes later, the man said, \"Let's try again. Are you ready?\"  _  of them took hold of the box again. \"One, two, three!\" the man said, and they went on with their struggle. At last, when they were very tired, the man said, \"You are  _  . It really is stuck. I don't think there's  any way  we can get it out of the car.\" \"Get it out of the car!\" The woman cried. \"I'm trying to get it in!\"",
