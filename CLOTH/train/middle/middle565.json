    "article": "Life will be  _  because many changes will take place in 30 years, but what will the changes be? The population is growing fast. There will be  more and more  people in the world and most of them will live longer than before. Computers will be  _  smaller and more useful, and there will be at least one in every home. Computer science will be one of the most important  _  in school. People will work fewer hours than they are doing now, so they will have more free time for sports, watching TV and traveling. Traveling will be much cheaper and  easier  Many more people will go to other countries  _  holidays. There will be changes in our food, too. More land will be used for  building  new towns and houses. Then there will be less  _  for cows and sheep, so meat will be more expensive. Maybe people won't eat it every day; they will eat more vegetables and fruit instead. Maybe people will be healthier. Work in the future will be different, too. Dangerous and hard work will  be done  by robots. Because of this, many people will not have  enough work  to do. This will be a problem.",
