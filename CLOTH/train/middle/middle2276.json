We don't always want people around. But we will feel _ if we never have friends.\nNo two people are just the same. Friends sometimes don't get on well with each other . It doesn't mean that they no longer _ each other. Most of the time they will become friends again.\nSometimes when friends _ away, we will feel very sad. We miss them very much, but we can _ them and write to them. And we can make _ friends. It is _ to find out how much we like new people when we get to know them.\nThere is more good news for people who have friends. They live _ than people who don't. Why? It could be that they are happier. Being happy helps you stay healthy. Or it could be just  knowing that someone cares about you. If so, you will take better care _ yourself.",
