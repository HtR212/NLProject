I started working this year, so I'm able to get new clothes more often  _  before. There are different people in my working place every day. If someone sees me in  _  once, I don't like to go out in it again. I like to wear bright colors and always dress up when I go to parties. I buy all kinds of clothes and I try to follow the latest way of  dressing  . Hi, I'm Jack. I don't have much to say about clothes. Shopping  _  clothes isn't really the way of life I'm interested in. Since I'm still at college, I don't really mind  what I wear  . I have two jackets and I often wear  _  . I know little about the way of dressing. I don't like the serious look. My name is Alice. I'd like to say that my clothes have to be comfortable and make me  feel  easy as soon as I put them on. Sometimes I buy clothes in some small markets--they're less expensive there. I go shopping for clothes about once a month. If I see  something comfortable  and fit for me, I would maybe go for it there and then.",
