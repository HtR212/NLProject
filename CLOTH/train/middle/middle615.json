Look at all these little yellow marks on the  _  of the cabbages ( a kind of vegetable ). They are eggs of a kind of insect . They are very beautiful but very bad for cabbages. This afternoon you must  find  all the eggs on the leaves and kill them. In this way, you will help us have  _  , greener and bigger cabbages.\" Betty didn't think she could do it  at once  and in the end she forgot all about it. The mother fell ill for a few days and  _  work in her garden. When she was well, she took Betty with her to the garden to see the cabbages. To  _  surprise , the insects have eaten every leaf. When Betty saw this, she began to  _  . Then her mother said to her, \"We should never put off what we have to do today till  _  . And you must learn to deal with the bad things  _  they are small, or it will turn into a big problem.\"",
