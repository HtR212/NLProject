    "article": ",A, B, c, D. Most adults once studied at school, had classes and did their homework every day. The same  _  is going on at school now.  _  it seems that doing weekend homework is  _  problem for the modern students. All the students should agree that weekend homework should be abolished .It's  enough  for them studying at school five days a week. They have a lot of interests. With homework to do on Saturday and Sunday, when can they find  _  to help around the house, go and see a football or basketball game or a good film, join in family recreations ,or just have  a rest  at home? Because of these other activities, the homework can't be finished until  Sunday night  .So their weekend homework is usually done in such a hurry that on Monday teachers are  unhappy  and often threaten to fail whole class of students because they know nothing about the  _  . If there is no weekend homework for the students to do, they will be happy to go to school on Monday  _  having a good rest and to learn what the teachers teach.",
