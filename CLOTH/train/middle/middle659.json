You have to decide what comes first, and then do that.\"\n\"You'll have to learn to accept yourself. You'll have to live with your limitations . You are just _ . You're wonderful. It's your duty to be who you are.\"\nIt's true that I can't do everything very well, but I'll try my best. Then I'll become myself-a lovely boy.
