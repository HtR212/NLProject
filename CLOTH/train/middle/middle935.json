We remembered that we all learned our own language when we were  children , if we can learn a second language in the same way, it won't seem to be so  _ . Think of what small children do. They listen to  _  people say and they try to imitate  what they  _ . When they want something they have to  _  for it. They are using language, talking  _  it all the time. If  _  use a second language like this all the time, they will learn it more  _ . It is also important to remember that we learn our own language by hearing people speak it,  _  by seeing what they write. In school, though you learn to hear and speak, to read and write, you must learn all new words through the ear, you can read them, spell them and write them  _ .",
