Go and pick up the horseshoe and put it in your bag, my son.\" But Thomas said, \"If I do so, it will waste my time.\" His father said nothing but picked it up himself. When they got to a nearby town, they had a rest. There the farmer sold the horseshoe and _ some strawberries with the money.\nThe father and the son went on walking. The sun was well up in the _ . They soon drank up all their water and there was not a house or even a tree for them to have a rest. Thomas felt _ thirsty to walk on. At this time, his father gave him a strawberry and he quickly ate it. After a while, his father gave him another strawberry and once again, his son got it quickly and put it in his mouth.\nAnd so they went on . The old farmer gave the strawberries and the son ate them. When Thomas had eaten up all the strawberries, his father said to him, \"My dear son, _  you picked up that horseshoe, you would have your own _ to eat. Always remember the lesson: if you don't worry about the little things, you will find it difficult to do  the great things.",
