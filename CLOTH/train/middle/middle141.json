    "article": "When you speak, write a letter or make a telephone call, your words carry a message. People communicate with words. Do you think you can communicate without words? A smile on your face shows you are  happy and friendly  . Tears in your eyes tell others you are sad. When you  put up  your hands in class, the teacher knows you want to  _  something or ask questions. You  _  your head from side to side, and people know you are saying no. Other things can also carry messages. For example, a sign at the  bus stop  helps you know which bus you can take here. A sign on the wall of your school helps you  _  the library. Signs on the doors tell you  _  to go in or out. Have you ever noticed that there are lots of signs round you and that you receive messages  _  them all the time? Books, newspapers, TV, radios and  _  all help us to communicate with other people. They all help us  _  what is going on in the world and what other people are thinking about.",
