    "article": "The bicycle is one of the simplest yet most useful inventions in the world. What is most surprising is that it was not  invented  earlier, although the great inventor Leonardo Da Vinci had drawn pictures for bicycles and also for flying machines and some other things. Those things were not produced  _  long after he died. A person riding a bicycle uses  very little  energy to make the bicycle move, and there is no pollution at all when you are riding. Even so, in developed  _  , most people don't travel to work by bicycle. It is not because the bicycles are expensive or people feel  _  if they ride to work. It's because  the number of  cars on the roads becomes larger. It certainly becomes  more dangerous  to ride a bicycle. As a result, more people put their bicycles away and go to work  _  their cars , and in this way, the situation is made more serious.  Perhaps  the best way to make riding safer and more popular is to create paths only for bicycles, and to make  _  so difficult and expensive for drivers to take their cars into the city that they will go back to use their bicycles.",
