We want to have a chance to enjoy ourselves. However,  we were _ to find that repairs are sometimes needed, but is it _ necessary to start early in the morning?\nSecond, we had hoped to _ in your wonderful pool. To our disappointment  ,we found that it was _ for the whole time of our stay.\nI _ you do not mind me writing to you _ these things,  but I would be happy _ you could give me some explanation.
