But humans have created things like plastic bags  _  can't be broken down by nature. Our rubbish kills animals and  pollutes  water and soil.  _  we continue making too much rubbish, the problem will only get worse. If nature can't reuse the rubbish, we must recycle  _  . We should clean up the rubbish we've made because nature can't. Recycling is also the right thing to do for another reason. The earth is rich in natural materials like water and trees,  _  these materials are not endless. We use up our natural materials much  _  than the earth is able to reproduce them. For example, each year we cut  _  more that 6,000 square miles of forest. But it takes an average of 25 years for a new tree  to grow  . Recycling can help us save the earth, so let's take action right now.",
