    "article": "One day, a teacher was speaking to a group of students. As he stood in  _  of the group, he put a large  _  on the table. He took out some rocks and put them  _  at a time into the jar. When he could not  _  any more rocks inside the jar, he asked: \"Is this jar full?\" Everyone in the class said:\" Yes.\" The teacher asked: \"Really?\" Then he poured some  smaller  rocks into the jar and shook them into the space between the big rocks. Then he asked:\" Is the jar full?\" \"Probably not,\" one of the students answered. \"Good!\" he said. He started  _  some sand in the jar until it filled the spaces between the rocks. \"No!\" the class shouted before the teacher  _  . He poured water in until the jar was  _  . Then he looked at the class and said, \"What are the \"big rocks\" in your  _  ? Time with your loved ones? Your education? Your health? Your dreams? A worthy cause? Remember to put these big rocks in first or you will never get them in at all. If you don't, you'll  _  have the time you need to spend on the big things.\"",
