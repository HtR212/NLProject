He was carrying a nice umbrella and he said that he would give it to us for only a pound. He had forgotten his wallet, he said he needed a taxi to go back home. My mother didn't believe what he had said at first, and _ him a lot of questions. But she finally believed the man and gave him the pound. She was happy to _ a good umbrella for so little. But the old man didn't get into a taxi. We walked _ him and found he went into a pub and bought himself a glass of _ with the pound. After he drank it, he put on his hat and took up one of the many wet umbrellas there and went off with the new one. Soon after that, he _ it again. Mum said \"This old man wasn't kind, No one won't have pity on him if he always does like this  \"",
