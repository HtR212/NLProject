New-born babies can hold things  _  either of their hands, but  _  about two years they usually like to use their right hands. Scientists don't know  _  this happens.They  _  that we inherited this from our animalvancestors but this may not be  _  .Monkeys are our closest relatives in the animal  _  . Scientists have found that monkeys prefer to use one of their hands more than  the other  --,but it can be  either  hand. There are as many right-handed monkeys  _  left-handed ones . Next time you visit the zoo,  _  the monkeys carefully. You'll see that some of them will use their left hands. But most human beings use their right hands  better  and this  _  life difficult for the left-handed people. We live in a right-handed world.",
