Then I do  _  running. I want to be  _ . I think running is good for my body . After I  _  my teeth, I have breakfast at 7:30. At 8:30, I wash my  _ . My sweaters are usually dirty  at that time. At 9:30, I do  _  homework. I don't like it. It is boring. I play computer games at 10:30. It's  _ .  But I can't play them for long. From 11:00 to 11:50, I have a  _  class in the City Club. I learn to sing. At about 12:00, I get back and have lunch at home.\nBest wishes,\nDick",
