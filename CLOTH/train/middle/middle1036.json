    "article": "There was once a farmer who lost his watch in his barn ( ). The watch was only cheap but it was very  _  to him because it was a present from his father. After  _  the barn for a long time ,he gave up and asked for  _  from a group of children playing nearby. He promised them that the person who  _  the watch would be rewarded ( ). Hearing this , the children hurried inside the barn at once . They searched  _  but still could not find the watch . Just when the farmer was going to give up, a little boy went up to him and asked to be given another  _  . The farmer looked at him and thought , \" Why not ?  After all  , this kid does look honest .\" So the farmer sent the little boy back to the barn. After a while the little boy came out with the watch in his hand ! The surprised farmer asked the boy how he  _  where the rest had failed. The boy  _  , \" I did nothing but sit quietly and listen for the sound of the watch .\" This shows us that sometimes a peaceful mind can think  _  than an excited one .",
