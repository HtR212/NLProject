    "article": "Hello Sandy,\nWe have just come back from our vacation. We went with our friends Edward Smith and his wife Tina to the Yorkshire Moors. This is a beautiful place. It is a _ park. There are lots of places to walk on the tops of the hills, miles of grassland with _ people, just sheep and birds.\nEdward, who had just come out of _ , could not walk as far as he used to. However this meant that we walked in the mornings, and then _ at a cafe for lunch each day before going back to the place we lived. Edward and I _ in front of the fire all afternoon, while the ladies went for _ walk. Very pleasant!\nYesterday we had the first snow of this winter. It was very _ (we usually expect snow in January). It was _ all day, then snowed in the evening. Today we have bright sunshine!\nBoth Jenny and I are well. I don't know if I told you in the last _ , that Jenny is now working in a hotel. Although she has to work hard, people there are nice and she is _ the work.\nPlease write to tell us your news.\nYours,\nVictor",
