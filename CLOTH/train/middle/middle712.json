In some  _  , artists carve beautiful things out of soft stones, because they can be shaped easily. In ancient times, people carved  _  persons or animals out of soft stones, which could be carried along with. While in some European countries, statues are carved  _  hard stones and they do not change easily. In summer, the hot sun  _  on these statues and in winter the snow falls on them, but they  _  remain beautiful. Stone is strong and long-lasting. So, it is  _  enough for buildings. A house built of stone does not catch fire as easily as  _  made of wood. Some stones are coloured, so they make the  _  ook wonderful. People can also get a fire with stones. Besides, some kinds of stones can be used to  _  jewellery . We've found stones are really amazing.",
