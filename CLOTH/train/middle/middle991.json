However, I didn't enjoy Indian  _  very much. On the second day we planned to see an old palace. At the  _  they said. \"If you go by train, it'll take you only two hours to get there.\" However, the hot ride  took  over four hours. I was very  _  when we got there , so we had some rice and vegetables with bread in a small restaurant. We were  _  to find it was quite nice. I wasn't full up though and I saw a man nearby eating some little meatballs. I said to my dad, \"I've been eating rice all week. Can I have some meatballs please?\" Well, they looked delicious so I ate the first one very  _  . I was just putting the second one in my mouth when I felt myself  _  --my mouth was on fire! I started to cough and there were tears in my eyes. I couldn't  _  how spicy it was! I drank about ten glasses of water but the worst thing was everyone was laughing at me. You couldn't make me eat another Indian meatball for all the  _  in the world!",
