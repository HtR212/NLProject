SomeChinese students often study very hard for a long  _  .This is a  _  habit, but it is not a better way to study.A good student must  _  enough sleep, enough food and enough rests. Every day you need to  _  a walk or play basketball or sing a song. When you  _  back to your studies, you'll find yourself stronger than before and you'll learn  more  . Perhaps we can  _  that learning English is like  _  Chinese medicine, the effects of your study come slowly  _  strangely . Learn  every day  ,and effects will come just like Chinese medicine. Wait and see.",
