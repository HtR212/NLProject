When a rabbit sees _ dangerous ,it runs away at once. When it runs, its tail moves up and _ .When others see this, they run away, _ .\nMany other animals use this kind of language . When a bee has found some food,  it goes back to _ home. It cannot tell the other bees where the food is by speaking to them,but it does a little dance in the air. This may tell other bees _ the food is.\nSome animals say things by _ sounds like a man does. For example,a dog barks when a stranger comes near. Some birds can make several _ sounds,  each with its own meaning. In a word, every animal has its own language.",
