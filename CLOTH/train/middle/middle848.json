Sam: In  _  idea, you are an adult at the  _  of 18. That's when you can vote . You can help to  _  who rules the whole country. That's also a grown-up does! My grandfather couldn't vote  _  he was 21. They changed it to 18 in 1971. Jenny: I don't  _  it's hard to say. I can drive a car at 16, can't I? When you have a driver's license, you can  _  it to people to tell them your age for all kinds of things.  _  sixteen must be the age when you change from a  _  person to an adult. Because you can tell others you are not a  _  any more. Suzie: Well, I think there is  _  wrong with American laws for when young people can  _  things. I can vote at 18 and drive at 16. So you would think that 18 is a grown-up,  even though  16 isn't. But then I can't drink wine until I'm 21! If I'm  _  an adult at 18, how can people stop me from  _  a cup of beer in a bar?",
