    "article": "You have often  _  people talk about work. Perhaps you have  _  your friends about how hard you worked to get something done. However, you may have done no work  though  you think you worked hard. A boy is pushing a big box very hard, but the box is  _  heavy for him to move and he may  be afraid  to push against the box.  _  the language of science, he has not done  _  work. Can you think you are working when you are studying or talking? In science, work is only done when a force moves something that has weight through a distance . Work =\" force\" x distance moved.  If  you want to find out whether work is done,  just ask  yourself, \"Is a push or a pull moving something through a distance?\" If your answer is  _  , then work is being done.",
