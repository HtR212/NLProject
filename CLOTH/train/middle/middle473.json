    "article": "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm here today to share a good lesson with you. It is a true story about an overseas student  _  in Germany.\nAfter years of hard work, this student graduated with amazing achievements. Everyone thought he was going to get a good  _  easily and have a bright future. But to his disappointment , he was not even given the  _  for an interview! The third time he was refused, he couldn't help telephoning the company to ask  _  they didn't want him. The answer was simple.\" We don't offer jobs to  _  people in Germany.\"\nWhat was wrong, you might wonder? The truth is, shortly after he arrived in Germany, this clever student found that it was  _ to skip buying subway tickets. So  to  save money, he often went without a ticket. As a result, he had been caught without a ticket in the subway several times.\nFrom this story, we learn that we may get short-term benefits in dishonest ways, but the truth will  come out sooner or later and the cost is high. So remember: honesty is the  _  rule.\nThat's all for my speech. Thank you!",
