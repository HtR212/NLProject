    "article": "Once there was a boy in Toronto. His name was Jimmy. He started drawing when he was three years old, and when he was five he was already very  _  at it. He drew many beautiful interesting pictures, and many people  _  his pictures. They thought this boy was going to be  _  when he was a little older, and then they were going to  _  these pictures for a lot of money. Jimmy's pictures were quite different from other  _  because he never drew on all of the paper. He drew on  _  of it, and the other half was always  _  . \"That's very clever,\" everybody said. \"  _  other people have ever done that before.\" One day somebody asked him, \"Please tell me, Jimmy. Why do you draw on the bottom half of your pictures,  _  not on the top half?\" \"Because I'm small,\" Jimmy said, \"and my brushes can't  _  very high.\"",
