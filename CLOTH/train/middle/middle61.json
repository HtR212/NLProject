So she was always  _  and didn't like to talk to others.  _  ,one day,her mother gave her a beatiful hair clip. When she wore it,she looked  much more beautiful  than before. She decided  to wear  it to school. On her way to school, she found that everyone she saw smiled at her. Most of them said \"Hello\" to her, but this  _  happened before. She thought that beautiful hair clip brought them all. She was so happy about all of the great things. Although she didn't  _  her classmates about her beautiful hair clip, they want to know what happened to her.  _  she went back home, her mother asked her, \"Did you know you  _  your hair clip? I found it at the door this morning.\" She understood that she didn't wear the hair to school at all. It was not important what we wear or how we look. The most important thing is  _  we think of ourselves.",
