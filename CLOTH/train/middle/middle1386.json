    "article": "The 2010 Shanghai World Expo has been open for several months and there are large numbers of volunteers serving there. Chen Chuan,a 19- year-old student at Fudan University, is usually fast asleep at 6 am. But over the May 1 holiday, he was rising early to eat breakfast and  get ready to  answer questions like,\"Where can I find the toilet?\" Such is the life of a Shanghai World Expo volunteer. But Chen and his 72,000 colleagues aren't complaining,  at least  ,they're trying not to. \"Volunteering is  hard  work,\"Chen said,\"but it makes me feel happy. \" Other student volunteers have  the same  feelings. Wang Lin an 18-year-old volunteer from Chongqing University,told us about trying to explain to a tourist why a line to visit a pavilion was so long. When the tourist suddenly got quite angry, Wang became upset  _  being shouted at. Wang said. \"I didn't expect we would have to face so many difficulties in our service. But I know serving is about giving  not receiving  . \"Still,the very next day, Wang received a reward when she helped a lost child  find  his parents. \"The happy smiles and their gratitude made me feel so  _  ,\"Wang said. \"That's  _  I now always smile to others,even if they don't look happy. Smiling makes me happy. \"  Because of  their green and white clothes,people call volunteers \"Little Cabbage\". Wang likes this nickname . \"We're green, we are fresh,just like the vegetable,\"Wang said.",
