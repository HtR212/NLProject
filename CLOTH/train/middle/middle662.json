    "article": "Last summer, we went hiking to mountains in the countryside. On the top of the mountains, we enjoyed cool wind  _ quietly near our ears. And we watched white clouds walking freely in the sky, clear streams running happily in the valley  , and  _ insects flying gladly in the air.\nWe were happy to  _ wild flowers and fruits, and caught beautiful butterflies in the valley. I lay on the grass to watch the  _ sky and enjoyed the peace of the valley. Suddenly a tiny insect flew into my left ear. It made so many noises that I feel  _ . So I covered my ears to stop the air from entering my ear. My friends helped me to find some  _ to get the insect out, but failed.\n\"The insect must  get lost in the valley. It happened to fly into the your ear.\" a little girl said  _ , \"I've an idea.\"\nShe led me to a dark place, and covered my right ear. Then she used a torch   to light my left ear. I felt comfortable slowly. In the torch  _ , an insect flew out of my left ear.\nMaybe we needn't _ about the insects that flew into our ears. Give some light to them, they will fly towards the light.",
