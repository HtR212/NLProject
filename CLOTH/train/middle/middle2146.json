Mr. Brown is such a person. Mr. Brown works in a  hotel  , and he lives in the town alone . He only has a sister. She lives in  another  town with her husband and her son, Mike. Mr. Brown doesn't have time to see his sister or her family, from one year to the  _  , but he never forgets  to send  them different kinds of greeting cards. These days, he is busy  _  a birthday card and presents for the 20th birthday of his nephew, Mike. Last Sunday, Mr. Brown had quite a surprise. He drove home from the hotel at the usual time, and he drove his car very  _  , not too slowly or too fast. When he got home, he parked his car as usual in the right place, and then he went into the house to make supper. Suddenly, there was a  knock at  the door. Mr. Brown opened the door and found a policeman standing outside the door. \"What's wrong?\" he asked  himself  . 'Did I drive on the wrong side of the street? Or did I make a mistake at work?' \"Hello, Uncle,\" said the policeman with a big  _  on his face, \"My name is Mike\".",
