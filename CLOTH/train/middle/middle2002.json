The boss was  _  to see his good worker go, and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favor. The carpenter said yes,  _  it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. He used poor skills and  _  materials. It was an unfortunate way to  _  his career. When the carpenter finished his work, the boss came to  _  the house. After he checked it out, he handed a  _  to the carpenter. \"This is your house,\" he said. 'It is my gift to you.\" What a shame!If he knew he was building his own house, the old man would have done it all so  _  . So it is with all of us. Think of your life as a  _  . Each day you hammer a nail , place a board, or set up a wall. You must try your best to build the house wisely because it is the only life you will ever have. Your life tomorrow will  _  from the attitudes you choose today.",
