I am in  Class One, Grade One  in Wuhan Middle School. I am easygoing and like making friends  _  other girls, but they must be good ones in many ways, such as study, obeying school rules and so on. I like English very much. Now I can speak  a little  with my English teacher in class. I study very hard and do well  _  exams. I want to be a teacher when I grow up. In my free time, I often watch TV or  listen to  my favorite music and sometimes play games or chat with my friends on the line. I also help my parents  do  a little housework. My parents both say I am a  _  child. They like  _  very much. This is me.",
