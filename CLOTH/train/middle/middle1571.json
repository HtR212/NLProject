He told the  animals  that he was a good doctor and could do something for them. The horse was clever. She knew  _  the lion wanted to do. One day when the lion was near the horse, she told him there was something wrong with one of her  _  and the horse asked him to look it over. Of course the lion was  _  to do so.
