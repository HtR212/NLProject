Maybe I was shy because I _ got used to talking with others. I only knew Spanish, and English was just a mixture  of _ .When the teacher spoke, the words became faster and faster. I was unable to _ . I didn't know what to do. I sometimes felt like crying, but I kept telling myself never to give up . \nSoon I started to learn English. _ the end of year I could understand, read, speak and write English. The next year I met my friend Erick. It was his _ year of school and he didn't know English, so I started to _ him this difficult language. We kept learning more and more every year and now we are _ very good English speakers. I also began teaching my two young sisters.\nNow I'm learning Japanese. It may be a little _ but I will keep at it. No matter how hard something is, I never give up.\nNothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it.",
