    "article": "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'll give you a quick introduction to the school before I _ you around. Our school is called a \"free school\". This means that pupils are free to choose what and how they want to learn.\nThe school opens at 9 am, _ the children can arrive a little late if they like. Most of them are in school by ten. _ eight and nine most are in the living room and the kitchen downstairs. This is also a time _ children and teachers can work out what they are to do for the day.\nNow if you look _ the door of that big room, you will see those children busy doing something there. Several children are in the kitchen _ Miss Cabell with lunch. The children take _ to do this. After lunch it's someone else's job to do the washing-up. This job isn't _ and not many of them like to do it.\nAfter lunch the children go on with what they've been doing _ school is over. On Friday we sometimes take the children to a cinema or a museum. The school is also _ every weekend for those children who want to come.",
