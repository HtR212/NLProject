Molly tried to make him _ , but he was still unhappy with the result.\nMolly thought for a long time and finally she came up with a good _ . She decided to make his favorite cake for him though she was not good at it. She just wanted him to know that every loss has its own _ and we can improve our performances next time. She thought it was enough if we had tried our best.\nAfter Molly finished making the cake, she gave Sam a piece. When Sam tried it, he smiled, \" No matter what others think of the cake, I like it very much. \"  Sam continued, \" Because I know you have made it with your _ and you have tried your best.\" Hearing this, Molly said, \" This is just _ I want to say to you. _ your team didn't win the game , you had tried your best. You are the greatest in my heart all the time!\"\nFrom then on, every time Sam _ to do something , he thinks of Molly's words. He is no longer afraid of failing.
