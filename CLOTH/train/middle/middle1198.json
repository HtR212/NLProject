    "article": "\"The grass looks greener on the other side of the fence.\" That's an old  _  in English. It means other places often look better, more interesting than the place  _  you live. Some people worry  _  young Chinese are beginning to feel that way. They see young Chinese ignoring Chinese culture and, instead,  _  Japanese cartoon books, watching Korean soap operas and even celebrating western holidays. Foreign books and soap operas are good,  _  Chinese writers and actors are just as good. As for holidays, Christmas is nice, but it can  _  have the meaning for Chinese that Spring Festival has, and the West has nothing to compare with Mid-autumn Festival. And let's not forget the part of Chinese culture I like best:  _  friendliness. Not all countries are as  _  as China. It's good to enjoy other cultures and to learn  _  them, but they cannot replace your own culture. It's good to look on the other side of the fence, but  make sure  you take a good long look. You will find that the grass isn't always greener on the other side of the fence.",
