He spoke to his friend Bill,\"I  hate  the hot weather, but I can't find a cool place in America. How should I spend my holiday?\" \"That's easy, \" said Bill, \"You'd  better go  to Moscow. Snow and ice are covering the ground now. \" Mr. Smith agreed  _  his friend. He bought an air ticket and soon  arrived in  Moscow. He had a happy trip there, but one day he  got into trouble  . After lunch he went outside the city, he saw a dog  following  him while he  was walking  past a house. The dog was hungry and wished him to give it some food to eat. Bad luck! He had no piece of bread or cake in his pockets. He tried to drive it away. But it began to bark at(......) him. He wanted to look for a stick but he couldn't find anything  _  snow and ice. Suddenly he saw a stone on the ground. He hurried to  pick it up  but failed. \"How strange Russians are!\" Mr. Smith said to himself, \"They don't tie dogs, but firmly  _  the stones. My God!\"",
