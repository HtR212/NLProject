They didn't have  much  money, so when it was time  _  their summer vacation, Bill said, \"Let's  take  our vacation in trailer , Fred. It is  cheaper  than a hotel. I can borrow my father's trailer.\" Fred was very happy, so they got into the trailer and began their vacation. They wanted  to get up  early the next day to go fishing,  _  they didn't have an alarm clock.\" That's  all right  , Bill,\" Fred said, \" I have a good way. I'll put  some pieces of  bread on the roof of the trailer tonight and they will wake us up in the morning.\" Bill was very  _  , but he didn't say anything. Fred was right. When it was at the first light, some  _  came down to eat the bread, and their noise on the roof of the trailer woke them up quickly.",
