    "article": "It was a sunny Saturday afternoon in Oklahoma City. My friend Bobby was taking his _ little boys to play golf . He walked _ to the man at the ticket counter  . \" How much is it to get in?\" he asked.\n\"Three dollars for you and three for any kid older than 6,\"replied the young man. \"We allow them to go in free as long as they are 6 or younger. How old are they?\"\n\"The younger one is 3 and the older one is 7, so I guess I will give you $6,\" said Bobby.\n\"Hey, did you just _ Tiger Woods(.,) in the game and get too much money?\" asked the man at the ticket counter. \"You could save yourself $3. You should just tell me that the older one is 6. However , You know it is almost _ for anyone to tell kids of 6 from kids of 7.\"\n\"Yes, that may be true, but the kids would know the _ between them,\" Bobby said. \"And that is the most important thing.\"\nAs the famous writer Ralph Waldo Emerson said: \"Who you are speaks _ loudly that I can't hear your words.\" In modern times, being an honest man is more important than ever, You should set a good example for everyone you work and live with.",
