I think I'll live in  _  apartment with my best friends, because I don't like living  _  . I'll have pets. I can't have  _  pets now because my mother hates them, and our apartment is too small. So  _  ten years, I'll have many  _  pets. I might even keep a pet parrot! I'll probably go  _  and swimming every day. During the week I'll look smart, and probably will  wear  a suit.  _  the weekend, I'll be able  to dress  more casually. I think I'll go to Hong Kong  _  vacation,  _  one day I might even visit Australia.",
