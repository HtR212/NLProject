It is very easy to  _  , though you can't hear it. It is a sign language. When you wave to a friend on the street, you are  _  sign language. When you  _  up your hand in class, you are saying, \"Please ask me, I think I know the answer,\" or \"I have some questions to  _  .\" When you smile at someone, you mean to be  _  to him. When you put your forefinger in front of your mouth, you mean, \"  _  quiet, please.\" When a policeman wants to  _  cars or buses, he raises his right arm. Sign language is very useful in quiet places or places  _  of noise. It is different from body language.",
