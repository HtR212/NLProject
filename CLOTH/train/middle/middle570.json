I'd pretend   to be a _ of the band, imagining that I made the music a little sweeter.\nWhen my father died at the age of 34, my mother took his pictures  _ the wall. The songs he had recorded were also _ away, but sometimes at night I could hear the music from our kitchen. When it ended, I could hear my mother _ .\nThe first few months after he died were about surviving and _ to move on. With time, the pain did begin to _ . But as I grew into a man, my curiosity   about my father _ . Did he _ the same beliefs as I did?\nI tracked  down his best friend and _ partner, Doug, who shared with me the songs they recorded together. In one song, he sang about an old man he met who reminded him of the _  of good friends:\nThe actions that'll make your past\nThey're the only things that'll last\nAnd be the best friend that you can\nWhen people  _ , they leave behind a house, a car, money -things you can _ that only remind you  _ the person on a surface level. My father left behind his music and words, and in them a piece of his soul  . Because of that, I can still hear his voice and sing along, _ I'm a part of his band.",
