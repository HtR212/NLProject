    "article": "Have you ever seen a \"tomboy\"? I have a girl classmate, Rose, _ acts like a boy. She is outgoing. She loves soccer, and likes to play _ boys. She even looks like a boy! On the first day of school, I was _ surprised to learn Rose was a girl that I nearly asked her: \"Are you a boy or a girl?\" But that doesn't matter any more. She is friendly to both girls and boys, and we've _ seen her high-tempered. Wherever she goes, she carries a smile along, and she _ it with everyone she meets. When she plays soccer or other sports, she smiles with joy. If her team wins, her _ shows joy and pride. If she loses, then her smile says \"they're so good, it was great playing with them\". When she meets a friend, her smile is a greeting, and when she meets a teacher, her smile is filled with  _ . Every day, when I ask _ about our math homework, she tells me every detail she knows. Before every math class, I see her  _ at the front leading the class, or carrying a stack of homework or math materials. I have never heard her say a word of displeasure or boast about her job in the math office.",
