The food is wasted in restaurants, at home and in school,etc. In restaurants or at home, people often order or cook  too much  food. But they can't eat it up. When they go out of a restaurant, full and happy, they never look back  _  the uneaten food on the table again. Should Chinese consumers feel  _  for the terrible waste? In schools, we can often see a lot of students  throw  food away after meals and they only eat the food they like. Everyone is supported to to have enough food to eat. However, in some places, the food is so  little  that a lot of people die from hunger. China has tried hard to solve  the problem  of hunger over the past thirty years, the job is not finished yet. Food is important to us all. We  _  live without food. So  _  is necessary for us to love food and try to eat up everything on our plates. When we eat in restaurants, we should pack up the leftovers . We also need to tell other people to stop  wasting  food as soon as possible.",
