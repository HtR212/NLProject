If everyone drives such cars in the future, there will be 1  _  pollution in the air. There will  _  2 be more space or parking cars in cities, and the  _  will be less crowded. Three such cars can fit in  the space  that it is now needed for one car of the usual size. The little cars will  _  much less to own and to drive. Driving will be  _  , too, as these little cars can go only 65 kilometers per hour. The little cars of  the future  will be fine or getting out of the city, but they will not be useful for  long  trips. Little cars which are powered by gasoline( ) will go 450 kilometers  _  needing to stop for more gasoline . If big cars still are used together with the small ones,  _  sets of roads will be needed in the future. Some roads will be used for the big, fast cars, and some roads will be needed for the slower, small ones.",
