How I wished that I could make time  _  at the moment ! However , it seemed that time flew more quickly than before . I lay on the bed , But I wasn't  _  at all . I just closed my eyes , thinking the every minute I had  _  with the friends I met during the camp . Just then , someone  knocked at  the door, \" Open the door ,\" said a soft  _  . I thought it was my friend , Elle . So I replied , \"It's open \" . I was  _  . There stood all my friends , Elle ,Lily , Sally and Alice . Together they walked over to my bed and then each of them gave me a big hug . We hugged each other . We  _  our phone numbers and e-mail addresses . We said that no matter how far we would be away from each other and no matter how many other friends we had , we would  _  forget each other . Just then , a tear slowly rolled down my face . As I looked up , I noticed all of my friends' eyes were filled withtears .",
