And he often helps his friends  with their  lessons. But as he comes from a village, the headmaster who was born in a rich family  is bad to  him and tries to make excuses to punish him. The boy knows it and takes precautions against it. One afternoon  all the students  went to have lunch and he bought  a piece of bread  . He was reading a book under a big tree while a dog was standing near him. At that moment  the headmaster  came out and saw it. He became angry and said,\" Don't you know we don't let  _  feed dogs in the school?\" \"Yes, I do.\" said the boy. \"Why have you brought your dog  _  school, then?\" \"It's not my dog.\" \"Why does it follow you, then?\" \"You're following me now, sir,\" said the boy, \"Can you say you are  mine  ?\"",
