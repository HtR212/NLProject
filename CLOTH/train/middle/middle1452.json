    "article": "Professor Green, known to the world as a scientist, is not only absent-minded but short-sighted as well. His mind is always busy  thinking about  scientific problems and seldom notices what is going on  _  him. One fine day recently, he went  _  a walk in the countryside, but as  _  he has a book in his hand. When he went out , he began to read his book . He hadn't gone far  when  he run into a big cow and fell down. In the fall, he had lost his glasses, without which he couldn't see anything. He thought he had hit his head  _  a fat lady. \"I'm sorry, Madam.\" He said politely  _  searching for his glasses. As soon as he had  put them on  , he realized his mistake. Soon he was fixing his mind on his book  again  and paid no attention to anything else. He had scarcely been walking for five minutes when he fell over again,  _  both his book and his glasses. This time he got very angry, seizing his umbrella, he gave the \"cow\" a wild blow. Then, after finding his glasses, he realized with horror that he made a second mistake. A large fat woman was fleeing from him in a horror.",
