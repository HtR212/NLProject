But man  has produced  a lot of pollution on earth since he first made fire, washed his clothes in the river and threw rubbish on the ground. Many years ago, pollution was not so serious  _  there were not so many people. There were enough  _  air, land and water. When the land or the river was dirty in one place, man moved to  another  place. Man is  _  the whole world now. So there is  _  enough clean air, nor clean land, nor clean water now. The more people there are in one place,  the worse  environment they maybe have. Perhaps you are afraid  _  is endless for people to produce pollution.  _  , we are glad to tell you that people have come to know the danger of pollution. And you can find more and more people are working hard to protect our earth.",
