How could I, an 8-year-old girl from _ , make friends in America?\nOn my first day at Anna Silver School, I met Miss Alice Green, my class _ . She spoke to me slowly and _ to get me used to her American accent. When she discovered that I _ drawing, she took me as the teacher. Miss Green made sure that I fit into   her class easily, and before I knew it, I was already having _ fun, just as other schoolgirls were.\nWhen Dad was sent back to India, I had to _ Anna Silver School. I was _ again. Miss Green had planned to take us students for a _ trip, but I had to say goodbye to them now. So, with a _ heart, I left my school and the US.\nBack in India, I received a package one day. It was _ Miss Green and my classmates. They had written me a letter each, _ me about the fishing trip. Miss Green said she _ me very much. With her good wishes, she added: \"Keep up with your drawing, _ you love it so much.\"\nI'm very _ to Miss Green.
