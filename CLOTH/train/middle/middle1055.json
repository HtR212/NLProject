Parents often say, \"Be quick, or you will be  _  \" We often dress, wash and  _  teeth in a hurry. Usually parents cook  _  for us at home, but now, as we can buy many  _  of breakfast outside, our parents often give us some money and we can  _  what we like. On the morning roads, we can find nobody is  _  . Everyone walks quickly, and  _  you might find people running. We can see people  _  breakfast on the buses before. But these days,  _  people eat on the buses. Young people are busy working or studying. What about the  _  people? Most of them are in the parks. They are  _  morning exercises. Some are doing kung fu, some are playing ball games, some are  _  and dancing, and others are running or doing  _  that suit them. Everyone has something to do in the morning. Morning is  _  , so please make good use of it.",
