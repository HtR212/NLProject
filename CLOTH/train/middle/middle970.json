    "article": "Colour helps you see things. But man and some monkeys and apes are the only mammals that can see colour.  _  any other mammals, such as the dog, the world  looks like  a black-white photo. Dogs hunt mainly by listening and smelling. Like  other  animals, dogs see best when things move. The animals they hunt seem to know this. A rabbit or deer will freeze when they find that they are being hunted. Then the dog  may not  see it at all. Birds can see colour. They need to, because when they fly, they need to find places to land. Colour helps them know  how far  the place is and what it is like so that they are able to catch flying things in the air or to  land on  something they think safe. Some birds see things even  _  than man. The birds that eat bugs can see them from far away. And even a very young bird can see a hawk  _  the sky. So good eyes and being able to see colours help birds  find  food and also help them find out  _  there are other animals that are dangerous to them.",
