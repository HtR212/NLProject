    "article": "\"You are my best friend.\" It's the nicest thing you can  _  to someone. It's also the nicest thing you can  hear from  someone. Good friendships begin in middle school. It's the  _  you begin to develop your own personality. Your parents aren't around so you  _  lots of time every day sharing your life with your classmates. You talk with them, you work with them and you become friends with them. But  not all of  them will become your \"best\" friend. Best friends are the people who like you and  _  you the most. They are the  _  who are easy to work with and easy to have fun with. Sometimes it's  not easy  to find a best friend. And sometimes you can  _  a little lonely. But just because you don't have best friend now, it doesn't mean you  won't have  one in the future. Best friends seem to find each other as if by magic. And when you find your best friend, the magic will last forever.",
