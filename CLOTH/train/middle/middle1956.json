We'll have to say  _  to each other-- to our best friends and to our beloved teachers. I have all the  _  and sad memories of the three years in my heart. Three years ago, three boys came to a school  _  different places. They were my best friends. At that time, we were young and shy with each other. However, as time went by, we became  closer and closer  . We studied hard together, played sports together and  _  out with each other. When we failed exams, we  _  each other. We faced challenges together, and solved  _  together. We shared happiness and sadness, and grew up together. Now, as best friends, we have to face the future separately .  _  can change this fact. I believe that,  _  we may end up in different high schools, our friendship will last. I have a  _  for my friends. I hope they will get good grades in the high school entrance exams.",
