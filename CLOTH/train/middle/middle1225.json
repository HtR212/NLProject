When you are  _  , you can go there with your family.  _  the zoo, there are many animals: elephants, deer,  monkeys  , rabbits and other animals. Elephants are the  _  animals on land. I  hear  there is a baby elephant in our zoo. So I want to  see  at it. Yu Xuan wants to go with me. She says, \"  _  we go there together?\" \"Sure!\" I say. \"We can  _  a good time there. But let's  go  there at half past four. I have  _  homework to do.\"",
