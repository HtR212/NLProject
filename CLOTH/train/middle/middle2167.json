It is often  _  \"The Ten-thousand- Li Great Wall\". It is one of the \"Seven Wonders\" of the ancient world. The Great Wall is  wide enough  for ten men to walk side by side. Horses can also run along it, too. The Great Wall  was made of  stones and bricks . There are huge stones on  _  side and on the highest part. But now some sections of it are worn out. There are tall watchtowers along the Great Wall. Once upon a time, the soldiers kept  _  the enemies in the watchtowers day and night. They made  fire  on the towers to  _  each other when the enemies came. Nowadays we don't use the Great Wall to keep away the enemies any more. It is a famous place of  _  to all the people in the world. Every year  thousands of  people come to visit it from all over the world.",
