    "article": "Dear Sally,\nI am eager to tell you how I miss you at the moment. I never realized the value if a _ until I lost a loved person, _ was very dear to me. I didn't consider our friendship precious before and I am very regrettable   for it. Now the pain still _ in the bottom of my heart. Whenever I watch my parents stay closer to one another, all I can think of is you. I know I probably didn't tell you how _ you were to me as often as possible, but you were the best in my mind. You always had a _ on your face that would bring sunshine to everyone. Only a funny joke or a simple word of yours would keep everyone _ . From then on, you began to mean a lot to me, Sally. Everyone in our class learned to _ things because of you. I think I was so silly that I would misunderstand your kind help at that time. Now you have gone back to your _ ----Canada, but I still want to say that I love you and miss you very much,. I am looking forward to hearing from you.\nWill you please drop me a line?\nLove\nLi Ming",
