It may be  _  for any family to live in a house with land around it. There  won't be  enough space for them.  A way  to solve this problem may be the skyscraper city . The highest building in the world today is in Taipei. It's about 509 metres high. The skyscraper cities in the future will be many times  _  . In a skyscraper city about 250,000 people will live. Nearly a million people can  _  in four of these great buildings. Each skyscraper city will have four towns in it and each town will have ten villages. They will live, work and  _  their free time in them. They won't need to leave the city  _  they want to. They will be able to move about in the city by transport controlled  _  computers. Let's imagine how the life will be then!",
