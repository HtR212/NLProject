    "article": "Reading  books is a good hobby for all kinds of reasons. First, reading books is fun. You can always keep yourself  amused  if you like reading. This is especially useful when the weather is bad. It is a  _  hobby too. You can really become lost in a book. Next, you can read a book anywhere; in a car, in a waiting-room, on a plane, in bed---even in the bath. All you need is a book! Reading is a convenient hobby  _  it is easy to stop and then start again. Another good reason for  reading  books is that it is useful. If you read as a hobby you will get better and better at it. This means that you will read faster and will become better at  understanding  what you read. As your reading improves, you will probably find your school work becomes much  easier  . Many school subjects depend on good reading and, as you read, you learn more and more. Some people say that reading is out of date. This is not true. You have to be able to read to use a computer and, the better you read, the better your computer skills will be. Reading is  _  out of date! Book readers are most likely to be good writers, too. They are usually good at  _  as well, and have more things  to write  about. Reading books is a wonderful hobby, one of the best. What other hobby could be more useful, or more enjoyable!",
