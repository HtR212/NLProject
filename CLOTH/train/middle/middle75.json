China has the  _  population in the world, and about one fifth of the people in the world live in China.  Because of  the large population, there is  _  living space for each family. And it's difficult for lots of people to find jobs. A large population also causes many  _  for  the whole  nation. For example, we are short  _  energy and water. Most cities are more  _  than before, and the traffic is much  _  . The large population  has became  a serious problem. So far, our government has taken many measures to control the population. One is know  _  the one-child policy. It has worked  _  in controlling China's population. Thanks to the policy, China is developing  _  and people's living conditions are improving rapidly. However, the population problem is  _  serious in China. We still have a long way to go.",
