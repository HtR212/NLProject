Finally the day came when the boy didn't get  _  at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to be not angry. The days  _  and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that  _  nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the  _  .

You  _  put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter  how many times  you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there. A mental hurt is as bad as a physical one.
