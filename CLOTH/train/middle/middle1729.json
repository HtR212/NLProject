They think that their children feel _ and want to spend more time with them.\nScientists in some colleges have found that working parents believed that they knew _ their children, but no one had ever asked their children what they thought. So scientists interviewed   over 1,000 children of working mothers or fathers to find out what they wanted. They asked the children _ they wanted their parents to stay at home and some other questions.After they collected the answers, it was surprised that only 10% of the children in their study said that they wanted more time with their parents. _ , the children who were interviewed said they wanted their parents to give more care to them. They said that their parents were as _ as a bee. When the children were asked about what they _ most, a large number of the children said that they wanted to feel important and loved.\nSo parents should know what their children really want and how to get along _ with them.",
