Don't put your head out of the window!\" But Mike didn't  listen to  his father. His father could do  _  . Then Mike's father wanted to  _  a joke on his son. He took Mike's cap quietly, hid it  _  his back and said, \"You see, your cap has flown  _  .\" Mike touched his head and it was really gone. The boy looked  _  and then he began to cry. He wanted to get his cap back. \"Don't worry, son.\" said his father, \"I have a strange  _  to get your cap back.\" \"  _  can you get it back?\" asked Mike in surprise. His father said, \"Close your eyes and whistle once, and maybe your cap will come back.\" Mike came  _  to the window, closed his eyes and whistled. Just at that  _  , his father quickly put the cap on the son's head. \"Oh! It is  _  !\" Mike laughed. He was pleased, then he quickly took his father's cap and  _  it out of the window. \"Now it is your turn to whistle, Dad!\" he said happily.",
