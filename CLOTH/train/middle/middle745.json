    "article": "Last summer, I took a part-time job for the first time in my life. I worked at a _ near my home for a whole month. I thought working in the restaurant would be the easiest job in the world. _ , I made some mistakes in the first few days of the work. I _ a few glasses and cut my hands while I was washing dishes. And it was _ for me to hold a full plate with just one hand.\nI was upset  . \"It will never rain roses,\" my boss comforted me. \"If we want to have roses, we must plant _ .\"\nHis words were a big help for me. They showed me that the more I do, the better I'll become.\nSince that day, I have become more patient  and willing to try _ new.   _ in a restaurant taught me how to talk with my customers _ a polite way. The month soon came to an end. But I didn't want to _ working. It was not because I got a high salary , but I _ a lot from this experience. In a word, I think my time at the restaurant will be with me forever and bring me luck in the future.",
