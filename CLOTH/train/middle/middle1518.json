Looking at that little sad face, he asked, \"Tom, what kind of _ did you have?\"\n\"It was a _ day for me, Daddy.\" Tom answered. \"I had a fight( ) with David. We made our teacher angry. She sent a note home about me. And I talked back to mom. She is _ , too. I am so sorry, Daddy.\"\n\"I know. So part of the day was bad,\" said Mr. Green. \" _ tell me about the best thing today.\"\nJack thought for a while and _ . \"After school I went fishing myself,\" he said. \"I didn't think I would have any _ . But I did. I caught a fish!\"\n\"I'm glad you had a good time,\" said Mr. Green. \"Try to think about it until  you go to sleep. Now I'm going to turn off the light. I hope I will see a happy boy tomorrow. Good night!\"\nEvery night, Tom answers the _ question. \"What was the best thing that happened to you today?\" Every night, Tom thinks about the best thing. Of course it is very helpful for him to have a good sleep.\nSometimes he has to think _ to find the best thing. Sometimes it is a very small thing. But he always finds one good thing to think about.
