He liked her very much and didn't want her  to die  . Jim talked to his mother about Donna. \"If I am going to die, I  will gave  my heart to Donna.\" Jim's mother didn't pay much attention to him. She thought, \"Jim is strong and healthy. He is still young.\" But Jim was not healthy at all. He  sometimes  had terrible headaches. One morning, he woke up  _  a sharp pain in his head and  couldn't  breathe. The Smiths rushed Jim to the hospital, but the doctor couldn't save him. The Smiths were heart-broken.
