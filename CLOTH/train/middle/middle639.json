I worked so hard because 1 had a great  _  one day, I would be the first Chinese person to win the Nobel Prize in physics. When I was eight, I  became interested in  physics. 1 first had physics  _  in Grade 8. In class, I  learned  that there had never been a Nobel Prize winner from China. That made me sad,  _  I decided to change it. I began to work very hard. Later on, I found physics lessons at school too easy for me. I wanted to learn more, so I  _  a reading plan and started to find answers to more  _  problems. Now I am a  _  student in physics. And I am  _  to be closer to my dream after a few years' hard  _  . Of course,  sometimes  being so interested in physics gives me trouble. My classmates always laugh at me when they are  _  about fashion or stars, because I know  _  about them. \"Well, that doesn't matter too much, \"I tell myself.\" They don't  _  much about physics or the universe , but I won't laugh at them. \"",
