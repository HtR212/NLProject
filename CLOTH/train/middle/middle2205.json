    "article": "Everything has two sides. One side of SARS is already clear. It is a deadly disease. Over three  hundred  people have died. But there's  the other  side. SARS tells us how weak  _  can be. Suddenly  _  gets to know that life is valuable . Wang Xinying, a student in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, was near to a SARS patient in April. He was told to stay at home for at least two weeks. \"Watching TV to know  _  more and more SARS patients dying, I  _  knew that death could be so  _  .\" he said. SARS teaches people to be grateful , not only for their own lives, but also for others. Xu Bing, a student of Beijing No. 5 High School, wants to be a doctor when he  grows up  . \"Though they certainly know of the danger, doctors and nurses are working bravely to  _  people's lives. I'm deeply moved by  _  they have done.\" He said. SARS also teaches sympathy . The past few weeks have been terrible for Chinese people. But there are far worse things than SARS in the world.",
