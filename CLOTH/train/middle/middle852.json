One evening, it was cold outside when it began to snow _ Mrs. White looked everywhere and shouted its name, but she couldn't find it, so she _ the police, and said,\" I have lost a cat. Did anyone find one?\" \"No, Madam,\" answered the policeman at the other end. \"I will ring you up if someone find it. By the way , what color is your cat?\" \"White\", \"I think it may be in the snow. But don't worry. I know cats are really very strong animals.

I think you are right.\" She said,\" and my cat is very clever. She is much cleverer than any other cat. She can almost talk .....\" The policeman was getting rather tired.\" Well then,\" he said, \"Why don't you put down your telephone. Perhaps she is trying to _ you now.\"",
