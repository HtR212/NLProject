Last Sunday I went to a school and asked some students  _  their favorite movies.  _  of their answers were really interesting. Here are their likes and  _  : Jim, a  13-year-old  boy, likes watching thrillers because they are scary  _  exciting. His classmate, Kate can't stand documentaries . She told me they were  _  parents. But she really likes comedies because they are funny. Jack is a big boy. He said he  _  mind documentaries. But he doesn't like comedies  _  they are boring! And the coolest movies are action movies. Everyone  _  them very much!",
