It is not big, but it's cool and quiet. I could  _  in the daytime and have a good sleep at night.\nOne day I had some  _  to solve. But I didn't take the dictionaries home. My father told me Charlie, one of my  _ , had a good library. I went to his house at once. We didn't see each other after I  _  middle school. At first he didn't recognize me. He  _  me up and down. And then he called out, \"Oh, dear! It's you, Fred!\"\nOf course we were  _  to meet each other again and talked a lot about our schoolmates and  _ . Later on he showed me around his library. It wasn't big but there were a lot of nice books in it. And the dictionaries I  looked for  were in them too. At last I said, \" _  you lend some dictionaries to me, please?\"\n\"I'm sorry I don't lend any books to  others ,\" said the young man.\n\"Are you afraid I'll  _  them?\"\n\"No, I'm not. I'm afraid you won't  return  them to me. Look! All the books are not  _ , but borrowed!\"",
