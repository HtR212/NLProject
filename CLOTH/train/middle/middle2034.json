    "article": "Swimming is very popular in summer. People like swimming in summer because water makes them  feel  cool. If you like swimming but swim in a  _  place, it may not be safe. These years, more than ten people  have died  while they were enjoying themselves in the water and  _  of them were students. But some people are  _  not careful. They often think they swim so  _  that nothing can happen to them in water. Summer is here again. If you go swimming in summer, don't forget  _  better swimmers have died in water. They died because they were not careful, not because they  _  swim. So don't get into water when you are alone.  _  there is a \"No Swimming\" sign, don't get into water,  _  . If you remember these, swimming will be safer.",
