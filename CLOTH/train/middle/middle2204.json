One cold night, somebody knocked  _  the door. The woodcutter asked his wife  to open  the door and let the stranger in. She said, \" But there is no space.\" The man laughed  _  said, \" Two can sleep well, three can sit.\" And then the woman opened the door. The stranger  was invited  to come in, and they all sat telling stories to each other. Then came  another  knock. The woodcutter told the stranger, \"Friend, open the door.\" And the man said, \"But there is no space.\" The woodcutter said, \"If three persons can sit comfortably, four persons can sit a little  _  than before.\" The stranger opened the door, and a man entered. Suddenly, a strange knock  _  did not seem to be human's! The woodcutter said, \"Open the door. I know who  is knocking  . It is my donkey.\" Everyone said, \"  _  is the donkey going to stand?\" The man said, \"Right now we are sitting, when the donkey comes in, we will all stand.\"",
