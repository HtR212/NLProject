After I have my  _  , I often go to a shopping center  _  my mother at about 8:20 a.m. The shopping center is near our home, so we walk there. It  _  us about 15 minutes to get there on foot. The shopping center is new  _  big. There are many things there, such as TVs, fridges, computers, clothes, food and drinks. I like the clothes there. They look very lovely. There are many  _  there. They are men and women, old and  _  .Parents have to  look after  their children because it is too crowded there. Children may get lost in it.  _  do many people come here to buy things?
