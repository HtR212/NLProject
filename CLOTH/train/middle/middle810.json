It is a really sunny day today and dad thinks it would be a fun day to 2  go on  a boat trip. I pack a bag and wait my dad by the front door. It doesn't 3  _  much time for my dad to prepare 4  _  he needs and then we set off . Once we 5  arrive at  the boat, I'm very excited. Dad tells me to sit down as we are ready to set sail . The wind is blowing6  _  my long hair when I see a black figure 7  coming  to us. I'm very worried but my dad tells me 8  not to be  worried. But then ... BANG! It is a huge whale. He hit 9  _  into our boat. \"Be careful, Megan!\" my dad shouts, but it is too late. I fall into the water. It's lucky 10  _  I'm not hurt and I swim to the boat and my dad helps me get on the boat.",
