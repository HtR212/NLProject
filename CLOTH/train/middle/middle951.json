He looked at it and  _  it was a snake . it was not  _  , but it couldn't move because it was so cold. \"Poor thing,\" the man said, \"I must try to save your life.\" He picked  it up  and looked for a warm place to put it in. But how could he find one in  such  cold weather? So he decided  to put  the snake inside his clothes, right next to his heart.  A few  minutes later, the snake came back to life and began to move.  _  it had become  strong enough  , it gave the man a bite . He killed it and went on. When he got back, he was very ill and had to lie down.",
