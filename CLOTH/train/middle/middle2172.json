    "article": "Do you think of the future? Three friends and I make a poster to show our thoughts in a class meeting. The main  _  of the poster is black. We hope it can make people  think  . We draw a green  _  at the bottom of the poster. We want to show that the Earth is so beautiful. If we don't protect  _  now, maybe we'll have to find another planet to live on in the future. The future is not all about  _  things. We write the words \"politics\" and \"technology\"  _  the poster. During our speech , we say in the future all the countries will work together. And our technology will develop very fast and make the world better. We also talk  _  a new planet to live on. We name it \"nearth\". It  comes from  the words \"new\" and \"earth\". We  _  think maybe in the future humans and aliens will live together and even have babies. We name these babies \"hulien\"--\"human\" and \"alien\". Do you like the future we think about? How will the future  look  in your eyes?",
