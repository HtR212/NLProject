    "article": "Each nation has many good people who help to take care of others. For example, some high school and college students in the USA often  _  many hours as volunteers in hospital ,orphanages or  _  for the aged. They read books to the people in these places, or they just visit them and play games with them or listen to their  _  . Other young volunteers go and work in the homes of people who are sick or old. They paint, clean up. Or repair houses, do their shopping and mow their lawns. For boys who no longer have fathers there is an  _  called Big Brothers. College students and other  _  take these boys to baseball games or on fishing trips and  _  them to get to know things that boys usually learn from their fathers. Each city has a number of clubs where boys and girls can go to play games or learn crafts. Some of these clubs show movies or organize short trips to the mountains, the beaches, the museums or other  _  of interest. Most of these clubs use a lot of high school and college students as  _  because they are  _  enough to remember the problems of younger boys and girls. Volunteers believe that some of the  _  people in the world are those who help to bring happiness. Helping others brings them much pleasure.",
