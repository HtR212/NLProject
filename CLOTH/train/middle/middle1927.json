In the middle of  _  school. There is a new teaching building. Its colour is white. Do you know  _  my classroom is? It's  _  the ground floor. The library building  _  the lab building are next to the teaching building. And there is a  playground  in my school. We can  _  football and basketball there. I  _  my school very much. I think it's really great. What  _  you think of it? Welcome to our school! Dick",
