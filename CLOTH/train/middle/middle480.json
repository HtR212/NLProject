The nurse says your son is visiting you today.I believe you are going on seeing him.\"\nShe _ me with a serious voice , \"Sit down , doctor .This is my story , not yours .\"\nI was surprised and _ .I sat down and helped her with the socks .She began to tell me that her only son lived not far from her , _ she had not seen him for five years .She believed her health problems were worse because of _ her son .After hearing her story and helping her put on her socks , I asked if there was anything else I could do for her .She _ her head and smiled .All she wanted me to do was to _ .\nEach story is _ .Some are clear; others are not.Some are true; others are not , yet all those things do not really _ .What matters to the storyteller is that the story is heard .\nListening to someone's story costs nothing but it is the key to healing  .I often think of what the woman taught me , and I _ myself of the importance of stopping , sitting down and truly listening .I believe in the power of listening .",
