It is very  _  for a teenager to have one good friend or a circle of friends. Even when they are not with their friends, they usually spend a lot of time talking among themselves on the phone. This  _  is very important in children's growing up, because friends can discuss something difficult to  _  to their family members. However, parents often try to  _  their children's friends for them. Some parents may even stop their children  _  meeting their good friends. The question of \"choice\" is an interesting one. Have you ever  _  about the following questions? Who choose your friends? Do you choose your friends or your friends choose you? Have you got a good friend your parents don't like?
