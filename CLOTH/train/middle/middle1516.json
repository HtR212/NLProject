    "article": "Some people have a very poor sense of direction.  _  , I am one of them. I  have visited  a place many times but I may still get lost there the next time. When I was a little girl, I was very shy and  _  asked others the way. And so I used to walk round in circle and hope that by chance I would get to the place I was going to. Now, I am no longer  _  shy to ask people for directions, but I often receive helpless or even wrong information. So I try to avoid giving people wrong directions. If anyone asks  _  the way somewhere, I would say, \" Sorry, I am a stranger here.\" Once on my way to work I  was stopped  by a man. He asked me  _  I could tell him the way to the Friendship Building. I gave him my usual reply. But just as I walked on only a few steps, I realized that he had asked the way to my office building. However, I had no time to turn back and  look for  him. I was rushing to meet with someone at my office and I didn't want to keep him  waiting  . When I just got to my office, the secretary showed in the man who had asked me for directions. Imagine how  _  I was and how surprised he was when we saw each other at the first sight!",
