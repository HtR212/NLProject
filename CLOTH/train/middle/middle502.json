    "article": "American people have the habit of saying \"Thank you\"when something kind is done for them or something polite is said to them, no matter how easy the thing is. This habit is learned by people of many  _  countries. You should say \"Thank you\"when someone  _  you the salt on the table, when someone steps aside to let you  _  , when someone  _  ahead of you keeps the door open  _  you, when someone says your work is well  _  or you have bought a nice thing, or your city is very beautiful. \"Thank you\"is  said  not only between strangers or new friends, but also between old friends, parents and children, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives. Parents often tell  _  children that they should say \"Thank you\"in answer to a kind word or act when they are only four  _  five years old. Perhaps that's  _  almost everyone has got this habit.",
