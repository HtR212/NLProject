    "article": "Mr. Strong is a London taxi driver. The following talk is given by him. \"I have been a taxi driver  _  nearly ten years. It's a nice job most of the time. You meet a lot of people. I always work at night,  _  there is too much traffic during the day. I go to work at 5:30 in the afternoon, and I usually  go home  between 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning.\" \"Some  _  things happened late at night.  The other  day I was taking a woman home from a party. She had her little dog with her. When we got to her house, she found that she had lost her  _  . So I waited in the car  while  she climbed in through the windows.\" \"I waited and waited. After half an hour of ringing the bell I decided to find out  _  was going on. I tied the dog to a tree and started to  _  in through the window. The next thing I knew was that the police came. They thought I was a thief.\" \"Luckily the woman came downstairs. She  _  have gone to sleep and forgotten me and the dog!\"",
