The bus driver, 24-year-old Wang Ping,  stopped  the bus without  thinking  twice. He got off and asked the woman what happened. She said that the man had a heart problem and should go to the hospital. Mr. Wang knew he had to act  _  . He told the passengers that he must take the man to the hospital. He expected most or all of the passengers to  get off  and wait for the next bus. But to his  surprise  , they all agreed to go with him. Some passengers helped Mr. Wang to move the man on the bus.  Thanks to  Mr. Wang and the passengers, the doctors saved the man in time. \"It's sad that many people don't want to help others because they don't want any trouble,\" says one passenger. \"But the driver didn't think about  _  . He only thought about  _  a life.\"",
