Everything there was beautiful,but it is too cold this time of the year.And it's really _ far to go for a short holiday.I decide _ this isn't a good time to go to the mountains.But I do want to go somewhere else.\nPerhaps this would be a good chance to go to the beach .I like to go for walks _ the seashore _ the warm sunshine and watch the water.It's only eight miles and I will get there _ about two hours.After thinking it _ ,I am sure that this is a _ time for the seashore than the mountains .",
