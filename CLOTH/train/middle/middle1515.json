    "article": "Middle school days are both fun and busy. Students spend their days in class,  _  to the interesting or sometimes boring words of their teachers. At break , they run, play and shout happily . But  _  should students spend their free time after school? In western countries,  _  is normal for students to have a part-time  _  after school or at weekends. Students can make their  _  money and learn more about the real world. They enjoy the independence and money, and their parents enjoy the quiet house. However, it seems that, in China, parents  _  so much about their children's studies that they would like to see their children spending most of their time  _  for all those exams. It is natural for Chinese parents to feel that  _  , but I think everything should be kept in balance. Sometimes, western school children  _  long hours after school to make money, so they 1  _  too tired to listen in class or do their homework. But Chinese students spend so much time on their studies that all else becomes less important.",
