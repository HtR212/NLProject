If you are in big  _  like Shanghai or Beijing, maybe you get to school  _  a subway or you have to  walk  to school because you live in a mountain village. Here I am just trying to say something about  _  . Ten years  _  , bicycles were very  _  in most villages.  _  family had one or two of bicycles. Children got to school by bicycle;  _  rode bicycles to go shopping. Then motorcycles  _  to become popular. People no longer rode bicycles because motorcycles ran  _  faster. But now, in some countries,bicycles are highly suggested  _  the main means of transportation. They think buses, cars and motorcycles pollute the air but bicycles  _  . So, to live a low-carbon life,  _  a bike is a good way.",
