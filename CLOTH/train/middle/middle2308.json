    "article": "A rich American went into a shop in London. He wanted very much  to get  a nice looking watch. He saw a watch and liked it  _  much that he decided to buy it. But the owner of the shop insisted five hundred dollars for it. When the American was hesitating, a young man suddenly came into the shop, took  the watch  out of the owner's hand and ran out with it. It all happened in few seconds. When the owner ran out  _  the street, the young man was already disappearing among the people. The American went on. At the next corner, he saw  the young man  with the stolen watch in his hand. \"Don't you want to buy a fine watch, sir?\" he asked in a low  _  , \"It's only a hundred dollars.\" \"The young man doesn't know  _  saw him stealing the watch just now,\" he thought. The American paid at once and went  _  back to his room with the watch. He told his friend about the fine watch. His friend took a look at the watch and started laughing. He said, \"You are  a fool  . The watch isn't worth  _  ten dollars. I'm sure the shop owner and the young man planned all this together.\"",
