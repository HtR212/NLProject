    "article": "We sometimes call the lion \"the king of the jungle \" because it is stronger and more dangerous than other animals. It can  _  faster than many animals and it can hunt the best. It is the highest animal in the  _  food chain. In the sea, the shark is one of the animals at the  _  of the food chain. It can swim faster than  _  other sea animals, and it can use its big teeth to eat them. What is at the top of the world's food chain?  _  !We are not the biggest or fastest, but we are the  cleverest  . We could not run faster than cheetahs , so we  _  planes and now we can move the fastest. We could not  _  better than lions, so we invented guns. Now we can hunt the best. People's inventions are great, but they can be  _  , too. For example, man built  _  , and now they make the air and rivers dirty. This can make  _  changes. Dirty rivers kill fish.  _  bears cannot eat the fish and the bears die. If we kill one part of the food chain,  other parts  also die. Remember that we are a part of the food chain!  _  we are in danger too! If we protect animals, we are protecting  ourselves  !",
