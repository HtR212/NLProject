Some mobile phones are  no longer  just phones--they are being used as radios,cameras and MP5 players, and they are also  _  to send e-mails or surf the Internet. Some of them can even be used as mini computers. People have  _  ideas about whether students can use mobile phones at school or not. Some people think that students don't really  _  mobile phones. If their parents have something  _  to tell them, they can ask their teachers for help. If someone's mobile phone rings during a Chinese class, he and his classmates can't  listen to  what the teacher is saying. Some parents also say that their children  _  use their mobile phones to download  _  information from the Internet. They are really worried about this. But other people believe we can find some  _  to use mobile phones to improve students'  _  in learning, since many of today's mobile phones are like mini computers. And children usually know more than adults when it comes to use mobile phones.",
