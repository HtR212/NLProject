They have to be very careful about the  _  of the light because the light shines on their work. Every  _  gets its light either from daylight  _  the window or from the lamps,  _  no matter what kind of light it is, the way it shines is very important to the eyes. Take a book and sit with your  _  towards the window, and try to read. Your shadow falls all over the page and makes it  _  for your eyes as if you were in a  _  room. Now turn around and face the window. The page is in shadow again,  _  the bright light is in your eyes.Try sitting with your  _  side towards the window. This is very good for reading, but if you were writing, the shadow  may  fall across the page and trouble you  a little  .There is another way - sit  _  your left side to the window. Now everything is perfect for  _  as well. Whatever kind of light is in the room, the rule about the right way to sit is  _  the same. So you see different ways to sit make much difference in writing or studying.",
