Some leaves from a nearby tree fell into the water and the leaves were in the water for  some time  . The emperor noticed that the leaves in the water produced a  _  smell. Later he decided  to taste  the hot water with the leaves. It was quite delicious. And  in this way  , one of the worl's favorite drinks was invented.  _  is the home of tea. And tea has more than 4,000 years history.  _  the three drinks--tea, coffee and cocoa, tea is drunk by  the largest number of  people in the world.
