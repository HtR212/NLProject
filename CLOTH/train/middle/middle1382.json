Birbal  _  the habit of the king. He understood the  _  at once and asked, \"May I know the question so that I can  _  for an answer?\" Akbar said, \"How many crows are there in this city?\"  _  even a moment's thought, Birbal replied \"There are fifty thousand five hundred and eighty nine crows, my lord\". \"How can you be so  _  ?\" asked Akbar. Birbal said, \"Make you men  _  , My lord. If you find more crows it means some have come to visit their relatives here.
