I can't find my seat.\" The air hostess showed  _  the seat and told him   to sit down  and fasten the seat belt . She told John not to move about when the plane was going up. And she also said that John's ears might feel  a little  strange, but he didn't need to  worry about it because many people felt   _  that.
