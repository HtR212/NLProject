I am not good at  _  you my feelings face to face, so I'm writing to show my deep  _  for you. You are not rich or famous. But in my heart, you are one of the greatest  _  in the world. I'm  _  of you. You are  _  interested in fame and wealth . But you often  _  me to school and help me  _  my schoolwork. You work  _  as a manager in your company. The smile on your face shows you are  _  with our family. You take good care of my grandparents. You do some  _  with Mom and cook for us on Sundays. Now I am sorry to say I didn't  _  you my love before, but I am thankful for  _  you have done for me. I feel quite lucky that I have  _  a great father.  _  now I can let you know how much I love you. Wish you happiness forever! Yours, son",
