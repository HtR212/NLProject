Soon their conversation turned into complaining  _  stress in work and life. Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the  _  and returned with a large pot of coffee and some  _  --porcelain , plastic, glass, crystal .Some were cheap, while others were expensive. He told them to  _  one for themselves to the coffee. When all the students had a cup of coffee in each  _  ,the professor said:\"If you noticed,everyone had chosen the nice looking expensive cups ,  _  behind the cheap ones. While it is natural for you to choose only the best for yourselves, that's  _  you always feel so stressed out.Be sure that the cup itself does not make the coffee taste  _  . What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup,  _  you consciously chose the best cups.Now consider this:Life is the  _  ; the jobs, money and success are the cups. They are only  _  to hold life, and the type of cup does not mean anything. Sometimes, by concentrating only  _  the cup, we  _  to enjoy the coffee God has made for us. \" The happiest people don't have the best of everything.They just make the best of everything.Live simply.Love gently.Care deeply.Speak kindly.Leave the  _  to God.",
