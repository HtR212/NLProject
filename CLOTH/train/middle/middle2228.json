    "article": "In many people's eyes, middle school students are happy and carefree . But is it the truth? And what  _  students happy or unhappy? To find out the answers, Li Jiahui, a student in Pinggu No. 3 Middle School, Beijing, spent six months  studying  students' sense of happiness last year. The  15-year-old  girl made a survey with questions such as \"Are you feeling happy?\" and \"What makes you unhappy?\" After studying the answers from 284 students, Li learned that  _  40% of the students feel unhappy, and the  _  from studies is the main reason for their unhappiness. \"More than 50% said they were under pressure and 70%  _  get enough sleep,\" Li said. \"It shows that middle school students are not so happy  _  people think. They worry a lot, and they can get angry easily.\" Li also said that over 90% say their happiness has nothing to do with how much money they have. Instead, they  care about  their relationships with friends, teachers and parents. \"Students always feel better when they  get along  well with each other,\" Li said. After her survey, Li listed  a number of  tips that may make students happier, such as: Treat yourself better, be kind and polite to your friends and relatives, and try new things.",
