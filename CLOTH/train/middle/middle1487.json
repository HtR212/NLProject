    "article": "People of Burlington are being disturbed by the sound of bells. Four students from Burlington College of Higher Education are in the bell tower of the church and have made up their minds to  _  the bells nonstop for two weeks as a protest against heavy trucks which run  day and night  through the narrow High Street.\"They not only make it  _  to sleep at night, but they are doing damage to our houses and shops of historical  _  ,\" said John Norris, one of the protesters. \"  _  we must have these noisy trucks on the roads,\" said Jean Lacey, a biology student, \"why don't they build a new road that goes round the town? Burlington isn't much more than a  _  village. Its streets were never meant for heavy traffic\". Harry Fields also studying  _  said they wanted to make as much noise as possible to force the government officials to realize what everybody was having to stand. \"Most of them don't live here anyway,\" he said, \"they come in for meetings and the Town Hall is soundproof , so they probably don't  _  . It's high time they realized the problem.\" The fourth student, Liza Vernum, said she thought the public were mostly on their side, and even if they weren't they soon would be. I asked if they were  _  that the police might come to stop them. \"Not really,\" she said, \"actually we are suitable bellringers. I mean we are assistant bellringers for the church. There is no  _  against practising.\" I left the church with the sound of the bells ringing in my ears.",
