    "article": "Thousands of  people from around the world came to the eastern Spanish town of Bunol. They threw tons of tomatoes  _  each other in a yearly food fight. That made the street in red juice. A rocket  fired  from the town hall was the start of the event for which local government offered 120 tons of tomatoes. Many people, including many from Britain, France, Germany, Russia and Asia, wore hard hats, glasses or protective plastic sheets.  In order to  protect their things from the sea of red mush , shopkeepers  put up  huge plastic covers on the front of their stores. About 40,000 people took part in the tomato fight this year,  more than  four times the people of the town.  How  amazing! After the fight lasting about one hour, municipal workers and local people used big water pipes to clean the streets which were covered with tomato mush. The joiners went to a nearby river to wash  _  . The tomato fight is held each year on the last Wednesday in August. The start of the event is still not clear although it is  thought  to have its roots in a food fight between childhood friends  in the 1940S  in Bunol.",
