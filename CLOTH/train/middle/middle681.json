I agree with it  _  from my experience , I think it's  _  for each one to have a good neighbor. First, a good neighbour is a good friend. One winter day when our family moved to a new house, our neighborhood helped us to  _  some furniture and told us something  _  this neighbourhood. They invited all members of  _  family to their home and have a hot drink. They made us  feel  comfortable here. Next, a good neighbor is a good relative .When we travel, our neighbors  _  take care of our house and keep the letters for us. When they  _  , we also help them as they do. In the new neighborhood, we always  _  each other. We are just like good relatives. Finally, I get a very important  _  from our neighbours that having a good neighbour is being a good neighbor yourself.",
