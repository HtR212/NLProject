He looked  _  . \"What's wrong  _  you?\" asked the tree. The boy answered: \"I want my own house. I need money to buy it.\" \"You can pick my apples and  _  them. Then you will have money.\" The boy picked all the apples on the tree and left  _  . A few years later, the boy came back. He told the tree that he wanted to travel around the world. \"Use my branches to build your boat.\"  _  the boy cut the tree branch. Many years later, the boy returned. \"Sorry, but I don't have  _  for you.\" The tree said. \"All  _  need is a place to rest.\" said the boy. The tree said, \"Good! Old tree roots are the best place to rest.\" The boy sat down. The tree was glad. The tree in this story is like your parents. Your parents are like a tree. They always  _  you, no matter where you are.",
