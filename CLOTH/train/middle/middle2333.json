    "article": "Who says honesty is dead? Last Tuesday morning Alan Reed, a student at Claremont College here, was getting  _  money out of the bank. He wanted to have 50 dollars and the teller  _  him five twenties instead of five tens. For a few seconds, Alan wondered  _  to do it. Should he give the extra money back? Keep it?  _  he kept it, he could buy several new CDs, or he could take his friend Simon to a big dinner.  _  no one would ever notice . But then he  saw  the teller. She was a middle-aged woman with a sweet face, and she reminded him of his mother. She had been nice to him. Then he thought that there were probably exact  _  kept of how much money was paid out, and the  _  would probably get in trouble.  _  of all, Alan felt he would probably feel  _  about keeping the extra money. So Alan gave back the money.",
