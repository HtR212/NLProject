Our community centre is like a big family.\nMy family member are social workers. My father is a computer _ He often helps others check and fix their computers. My mother is a college teacher. She always tries to help students with _ homework. At the weekend my sister and I often go to see the old people and do some shopping for them. Our neighbours are all kind _ helpful. They always say\"Hello\"to us when they meet us. When our bicycle are broken, they are ready to help us. Love House is our favorite _ . We go there when we need help _ all kind of problems.\nWe love our community centre. We think it is _ for us to have a community centre like this. Are you going to visit it? Welcome you.",
