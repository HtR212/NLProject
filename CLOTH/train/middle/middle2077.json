He did not know what he could do about it because it was  _  heavy that he couldn't lift it himself. He only hoped that someone would soon  pass by  and lend him a hand. Just at this moment, a man  riding  a horse came up to him. But the farmer felt  _  when he saw who he was. It was the great man who lived nearby. He thought the great man wouldn't help him, and hoped  another  farmer would come up. But to his  _  , the great man got off his horse  as soon as  he came near, \"I see you need help,\" he said. \"I'm here just  _  the right time.\" Then he took one end of the bag and the farmer took the other. They lifted it together and put it on the horse. \"Sir,\" asked the farmer, \"How can I pay you?\" \"It's quite easy.\" the great man answered. \"When you see  anyone else  in trouble, do the same for him.",
