However, we have not found life on any other planets _ .\nThe earth is a planet and it _ around the sun. Seven other planets also go around the sun. none of them has an environment like that of the earth, so scientists do not think they will find life on them. The sun and its planets are called the solar system, and our solar system is a small part of a much larger group of stars and planets, called the Galaxy or the Milky Way.\nThere are billions of stars in the Galaxy, and our sun is only one of them.\nScientists have also discovered many other galaxies in the universe. They are very far away and their light has to travel for many years to reach us. So how large is the universe? It is impossible to imagine.\nScientists have sent spaceships to the planet Mars to take photos . They have even\nsent spaceships to travel outside the solar system. However, no spaceship has travelled far enough to reach other stars in our Galaxy.\nScientists have always asked the questions: with so many stars in the universe, are we _ , or is there life out there in space?
