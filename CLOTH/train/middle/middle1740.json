You and he are taught by the same teachers . Why couldn' t you be as  _  as him ?\"his mother would say . Many students hear  _  words from their parents . After the parents' meeting, their parents begin to  _  them with other students , especially those who are praised by teachers . \"I want to encourage my child to  learn from  them ,\"explained Li Shulan , a mother of a 14-year-old boy from Xi'an , Shanxi . However , many children , like Wang , don' t like it . \"I feel very  _  and sometimes even'hate'those students ,\"Wang said . Parents have good intentions , but in fact they could  _  children' s self-esteem , said Lin Ying , a psychological teacher at Xiamen Hubin Middle School in Fujian . If children feel hurt , they should let parents know it . \"You can choose a relaxing occasion, for example, over the dinner, and tell your parents your feelings,\"Lin said. \"Also, some articles online explain  _  it could be bad for children . You may want to show such articles to your parents.\" It' s not all bad , though .

I take them as examples and try to  catch up  with them ,\"she said . \"During the process , always keep in mind that you' re unique . Never  _  heart ,\"Lin added .",
