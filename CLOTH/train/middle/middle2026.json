    "article": "My friend, David Smith, kept birds. One day he phoned and  told  me he would be away for a week. He asked me to feed the bird  _  him and said he would leave his key in my mailbox. Unfortunately, I did not remember to feed the birds  _  the night before David was going to return. I rushed out of my house and it was already dark when I arrived at  _  house. I soon found the key he gave me could unlock neither the front door  _  the back door! I kept  thinking  of what David would say when came back. Then I noticed  _  one bedroom window was open. I found a big tone and pushed it under the window  _  the stone was very heavy. I of niose. But in the end, I managed to climb up. I had one leg inside the bedroom when I suddenly realized that someone  was shining  )up at me. I looked down and saw  _  policeman and an old lady, one of David's neighbours. \"What are you doing up there?\" Said the policeman. Feeling like a fool, I replied, \"I was just going to feed Mr. Smith's birds.\"",
