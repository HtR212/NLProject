Some of your friends may have different views and interests, and some like doing the same  _  as you. Do you like friends different from  _  the same as you? You may like the friends who  _  the same interests as you. But I don't really care. I have two good friends, Peter and James. Peter is  _  me. I am a quiet boy, and Peter is also quiet. We  _  enjoy reading books and surfing the Internet. On weekends, we often go to the library or  _  on the computer together. But James is very different from us. He likes playing ball games, and he is more athletic than us. He is  a lot  more outgoing. He likes talking and often makes  _  laugh. You see, friends are not  _  to be the same. Do you agree with me?",
