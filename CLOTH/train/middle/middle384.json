Every evening he would see a factory worker coming  _  the hill towards the frontier, pushing a bike with a pile of goods of old straw on it. When the bike  _  the frontier, Peter would stop the man and  _  him take the straw off and untie it. Then he would examine the straw very  _  to see  _  he could find anything, then he would look in all the man's pockets  _  he let him tie the straw again. The man would then put it on his bike and go off down the hill with it. Although Peter was always  _  to find gold or other valuable things hidden in the straw, he never found anything. He was sure the man was  _  something, but he was not  _  to think out what it could be. Then one evening, after he had looked through the straw and emptied the worker's pockets  _  usual, he  _  to him, \"Listen, I know you are smuggling things  _  this frontier. Won't you tell me what it is? I'm an old man, and today is my  _  day on the job. Tomorrow I'm going to retire . I promise I shall not tell  anyone  if you tell me what you've been smuggling.\" The worker did not say anything for  some time  . Then he smiled, turned to Peter and said quietly, \"Bikes.\"",
