    "article": "My husband kissed the baby's cheek, said goodbye to me and then rushed out of the door, into his busy day. With the cold of the morning fading, I fed my baby and it fell fast asleep. Usually I would place it in bed and quickly have the house somewhat in  _  . This morning, however, I stayed seated, just  _  , with the baby in my arms. The thoughts ran into memories of the  _  with my husband, a father rushing out of the door to meet the obligations of life. It was only a small jump to thoughts of my own  _  . My mother passed away when I was ten, and as I looked  _  , I could see how much of a family man my dad was. He went to work every morning and returned to his family every evening. He provided food, clothing, warmth, and  _  . He was a faithful father. Setting the baby down, I dialed the  _  number. I had just realized the  _  of the ordinary daily life going on around us that we often took for granted , and that it needed to be recognized . \"Hi, Dad.\"I said,  _  back tears. \"Hey, Bud. How are you?\",  _  was in his voice. \"Fine, I'm just calling to say... thank you.\"I got it out before my throat  _  too much for me to speak. \"What for?\" \"For getting up and going to work every morning of my life. Now that I have my own child and I see my husband doing the same, I just wanted to thank you for being  _  \" There was  _  for a moment as my dad calmed himself down, and with a small tremble in his voice he said, \"You're welcome, Bud.\" I don't remember much of the rest of the call,  _  that moment of revelation about my father, I will never forget. Since then, I have realized that those  _  everyday fathers are the true heroes in life. I'm thankful that my father was one of them.",
