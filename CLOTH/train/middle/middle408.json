    "article": "Dear Dad, I know you  _  love me ,but I  don't think  you understand my life. You hope I study all the time. I know you want me  to find  a good job when I grow up but I think studying all the time is bad for me. I  _  need time to relax. You never think about fun things for me to do . You don't know I like music and sports. Yesterday when I was watching a soccer game  _  TV, you asked me to stop and  do  my homework. After finishing my homework, I wanted to play the piano, but you said I should go to bed early. That was  bad enough  I can't do what I want to do. I didn' t like what you did for me. I really love you, Dad, but I hope you can try  not to be  so strict  _  me. I think you should give me some  _  time to relax.",
