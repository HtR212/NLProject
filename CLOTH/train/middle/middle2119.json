    "article": "Debbie got up early last Saturday morning. She wanted to go skating in Green Park with some of her friends. She was very happy about it.\n As soon as she was ready, she got on her bike and left for the park - it was on the other side of the town. Suddenly, as she was riding fast, she heard sirens  . The sound of the sirens was getting closer and closer , so Debbie looked behind her to see what was happening. As a result  , she fell off her bike and lay in the middle of the road. Luckily, Debbie wasn't hurt, _ a car hit her bike. After the car stopped , two men got out and started running. Just then , a police car stopped next to the same car and three policemen got out and started running after the two men. One of the policemen shouted, \"Stop the thieves  !\"\n Some time later a policeman came to see Debbie. He thanked her because, in  a way, she had helped them catch the thieves .",
