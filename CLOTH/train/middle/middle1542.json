Heoften talks about his favourite  _  , the robins . \"When I was a boy, these houses were nothere. There were wide fields and tall trees. Every spring the robins would come. Thousands of them would flyup to the north from the south. They spent the  _  in the south. Some would build their nests in the  _  near our houses. We knew it was spring when the robins came. When they left , we knew winter  _  \"Then people  _  building more houses. They cut down trees and they filled the fields  _  houses. The robins stopped  flying  back. Oh, we'd seen some once in a while , but they couldn't find a right place  to build  their nests near our houses because there were no trees.\" \"Now there are lots of houses and roads. There are no  _  area for the robins. They do not comeany more, which is sad.\"",
