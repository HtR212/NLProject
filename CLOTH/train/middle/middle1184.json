I set up my speaker and my microphone and then began walking into different kinds of  _  , because I didn't know which room was right  _  me. I just wanted to find a native English speaker to talk to,  _  I failed .Several days later, I went online again and  _  an English speaking room. I hoped this room would become a good place for  _  learners. The third time, I stayed in my room, and several people entered it. There were two native English speakers. One was from the UK, and the other was from Australia. It was too  _  because neither of them had a microphone.  _  couldn't speak to us but just typed words so our conversation went on  _  . However, I learned a lot from that conversation. I thought I have known a lot about English, but the fact is that I still have a  _  way to go. I will work harder.",
