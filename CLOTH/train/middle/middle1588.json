    "article": "A good memory is a great help in learning a language. Everybody  learns  his own language by remembering what he  hears  when he is a small child. Some boys and girls who live in foreign countries  _  their parents seem to learn two languages almost as  easily  as one. At school it is not easy to learn  _  second language because the pupils have  so little  time for it, and they are busy with other subjects, too. A man's mind is rather  _  a camera. It takes photos not only of what we see, but of what we feel, hear, smell and taste.  _  we take a real photo with a camera, we have much to do before the photo is finished and ready to  show  it to our friends. In the same  _  , there is much work to be done before we can take a picture forever in our mind.",
