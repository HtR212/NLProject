His father and mother are both teachers. Their house isn't big.  _  of them are very friendly  _  me. They teach me Chinese  _  I teach them English. Now I  can talk  with them in Chinese. But I can't  _  very well. Chinese is very  _  to learn, I think. Mrs Li often teaches me how to  _  Chinese food. Hmm! How much I like Chinese food! My school is not far. I go to school by bike. I  _  six classes every day.  After school  I play games with my classmates. I have a good  _  here. Don't you want to come? Please write  back  soon. Love from Jim.",
