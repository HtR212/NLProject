A US company now has a plan: sending people to Mars _ 20 years. To begin with, the company plans to send a few people to go to Mars first. It will _ them  several months to get there. When they arrive, they will build a  house first.  But Mars is not an easy place to live on .It is rocky,cold  and has lots of sandstorms . Also, there is  _ air for breath. So people would have to live in a special house. They would have to wear special clothes if they go out. People will have to find  _ resources ,iron, water and so on . All these could\nhelp people live there....  Sounds interesting? You might want to go to Mars now.  _ will things go well as the company hopes? We'll wait and see.",
