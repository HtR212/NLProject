    "article": "Last year my English class was  _ for me. First of all, it wasn't easy for me to understand the teacher when she talked to the class. To begin with, she spoke too quickly, and I couldn't understand every word. Later on, I realized that it doesn't matter if you don't understand every word. I was _  afraid to speak in class, because I thought my classmate might laugh _ me. I couldn't always make complete sentences, either.Then I started to  _  English language TV. It helped a lot. I think that  _  lots of listening practice is one of the secrets of  _  a good language learner. Another thing that I found very difficult was English  _ . So I decided to take lots of grammar notes in every class. Then I started to write my own original sentences using the grammar I was learning. It's amazing how much this helped. Now I am  _ learning English and I got an A this term.",
