If I hold it for a  _ ,it is OK.If I hold it for an hour, I will have an ache in my right arm. If I hold it for a day, you will have to call a  _ . It is the exact same weight,but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes. What we have to do is to put the glass down,  _ for a while before holding it up again.\" \"If we carry our burdens  all the time ,sooner or later, we will not be able to carry on.
