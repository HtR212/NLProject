    "article": "It was Dragon Boat Festival last Saturday and we had a three-day  _  . I didn't have a good sleep  _  work days.  _  I decided to be in bed for a long time on the first day. I  got up  very late and then I went to play computer games. In the afternoon, I went to the beach with my parents. The beach was a little  _  , but we still had great fun playing in the water. The second morning, I went to the  library  and read some English books. Because I want to learn English well. In the afternoon, I went to visit Alice and we  _  some math questions. The last day, we went to the Great Wall. Those old and long  _  made me think a lot. We  _  many photos there and we also had a picnic. We were all tired  _  we got home.",
