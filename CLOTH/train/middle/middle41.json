Then I remembered  _  had happened, I had been in an earthquake. For about two hours nobody came.  _  I could reach the bag of apples, so at least I had something to eat. Then I heard people  _  to me. A team of people had come to see  _  anyone was under the broken road. I called out\"I'm here!\"I heard a shout. Soon a stranger climbed to the bridge near my car. \" How are you doing?\" he asked. \"Not too bad,\" I said ,\"but my feet and legs feel  as if  they're broken.'' \"We'll do our best  to get  you out of there,\" he said. They didn't get me out  _  the next morning. I had been in my car for fourteen hours.",
