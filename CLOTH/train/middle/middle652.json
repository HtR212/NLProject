The corner started last year. At first, there were only  a few  students because many were  _  to speak English. After several weeks, more and more students came here. At first, some students just  _  to the other students. I was one of them. I was afraid to speak English. I thought someone would  laugh at  me, but I wanted to speak. I always spoke English in my heart. My teacher went on saying, \"Don't be afraid. Open your mouth.\" I tried and tried to open my mouth. At last, I said, \"Hello!\" to the teacher. The teacher was very  _  . She said \"Hello!\" to me at once. From  _  on, I began to speak English. I work hard at English and I try my best  to speak  more. I learn  _  my teacher and my classmates at the corner. Now I can speak a little English. Every Sunday morning, I come to the corner  _  . It's a good  _  to speak English. Please join us.",
