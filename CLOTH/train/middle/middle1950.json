    "article": "What is the population of China? There are more than a billion and three hundred million people in China. It is almost one fifth of the world's population. How to control the population growth is a big problem. Some people think it impossible to control the population growth. But I don't agree _  them, because where there's a will, there is a way.\nThe question is that we should make it known to everybody how serious the population problem is. Our farmland is becoming less and less to everyone. We have already got too many mouths to feed. Unless we control the population growth, many people will die of hunger. Too fast population growth has been and will be bad for our nation. Though laws  have been _ to control the population growth, in some places little is done to carry out the law. We should make people know that it is foolish to bring too many children into the world. They should no longer do what they have been doing for many years.\nWe are fighting against the rapid population growth. Yes, the fighting won't end _ everyone knows its importance and does something for it. Let's go on working hard on it together.",
