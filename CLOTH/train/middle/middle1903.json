The first one is that I cannot watch online videos without parents' permission. When I was in Grade 3 , I was  _  about a cartoon series, 'Balala Fariry'. One day, as I was walking home, I suddenly got a good idea: 'Why not  _  for this cartoon series on the Internet and watch it online before Mom comes home?' When I arrived home, I turned on the  _  and found the series online. Then I turned it down and watched it  _  . But when it played to the most exciting part, Mom walked in... She asked me why I watched that cartoon series before  _  my homework. I didn't answer because I was so afraid. Then she wanted to know if I watched other videos on the computer the night before , and I said I didn't. She knew I was lying ,  _  she saw the historical record on the computer. She was so  angry with  me because I lied; that was something she really cared about. That day , I  _  two rules . The first one : no television , video games or computer videos before homework is finished; the second rule: be  _  . From then on , I never lied again.",
