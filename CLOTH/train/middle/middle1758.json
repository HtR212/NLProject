You must say \"Thank you\" when someone passes you something on the table, when someone  _  the door open for you, when someone says you do your work  _  , or you buy a nice thing or your city is  _  . \"Excuse me\" is another sentence they often say. When you hear someone say \"Excuse me\"  behind  you, you know he wants to pass you without touching you. If you want  to break  others, say \"Excuse me\" first, and then begin talking. Let s  say  \"Thank you: and \"Excuse me\" from now.",
