    "article": "My work keeps me in Hong Kong most of the year,but I try to get away for a month in summer,usually in July.Now as you probably know,that's the main  _  season in Europe.The favorite places for vacations and the famous cities are usually very  _  . But I'm not seeking the sun--I can get lots of  _  in Hong Kong--and I'm certainly not seeking the crowds!So  _  I go on vacation,I buy a Train Pass(a kind of train ticket) that allows me first-class travel on most of the railways of Western Europe.First-class compartments are  _  crowded and they are very comfortable.If you're going on  _  trip, you can take a sleeping train for an extra charge.There are usually dining cars in the train. I find that train travel is restful and  _  .There's always  _  to see.I particularly enjoy  _  through Switzerland and Italy.You can get a very good  _  of what a country is like from a train because you don't go too fast and you stop quite often.Also train travel is very safe,and I am never sick on a train  as  I am on a ship. Then there are always people to  _  to if you feel like a chat. The reason that I seldom travel by plane is quite  _  : because train stations are usually built in the centre.I don't have to  worry about  transport , transport can be a problem when arriving by  _  .",
