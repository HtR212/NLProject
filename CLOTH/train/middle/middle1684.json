    "article": "Marc sat next to me when we were in Hill Junior School. He had a serious  _  in communicating with people. One always had to guess what he was saying.  _  , most of my classmates did not like to be with him because his hands and shirts were always  _  . I tried to let him know the importance of being clean by  _  him several times a day to wash his hands. But he just could not understand. One day, our teacher Miss West walked up to Marc.  _  saying anything, she took Marc to the washroom. Slowly, Miss West washed his  _  and told him that he should keep himself clean. She did that every day for one month.  At last  , Marc understood. Miss West's love has given me a good example to follow when I  am doing  my job. I always remember to teach my students by showing them the right  _  to do things. And most important of all, I always remember to give them  more time  to learn and to grow up.",
