    "article": "I have a wonderful friend. Her name is Emily. We have been friends ever since kindergarten. Last year, Emily started to  _  my things all the time. I  _  lent her what she asked for because I wanted to be nice.  _  then I noticed that she was not always returning the things she had borrowed! One day I asked Emily to give my things back. She said that she  _  remember what she had borrowed. I made a list and gave it to  _  . The next day she brought back only one thing. It was a dirty T-shirt. The next time I went to Emily's house. I saw that her room was very untidy. I asked her  _  we could look for my things together. \"I know they're here  _  ,\" she said. Emily and I played some music on the computer and sang while we worked. The  _  lost thing that I discovered was my purple hat. It was under a pile of clothes in a chair. We kept finding  more and more  things. Emily has stopped borrowing things. Also, she is trying to keep her room  _  . I hope she can do it all the time.",
