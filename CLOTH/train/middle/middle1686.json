    "article": "Adults usually do not remember most of the things that are taught by their teachers at school. But this story is one  _  that I will never forget. It was a normal Monday morning, and my teacher was teaching us about  _  things in life and about devoting ourselves to what we really need. This is how the story went:  An old man  lived in a certain part of London, and he would wake up every morning and go to the underground. He would get onto the train right to Central London, and then sit at the street corner and  _  . He would do this every single day of his life. He sat at  the same  street corner and begged for almost 20 years His  _  was dirty, and a stench came out. The neighbors could not bear the  _  any more, so they called for the police officers to clear the place. The officers knocked down the door and  _  the house. There were small bags of  _  all over the house that he had collected over the years. The police counted the money, and they soon  _  that the old man was a millionaire. They waited outside his house expecting to  _  the good news with him. When the old man arrived home that evening, one of the officers told him that there was no need for him to beg any more as he was a  _  man now, a millionaire. But the old man said  _  ;he went into his house and locked the door. The next morning he woke up  as usual  went to the underground, sat at the same street corner and continued to beg. Clearly, this old man had no great plans,  _  or anything significant for his life. We learn nothing from this story but to stay focused on the things we enjoy doing.",
