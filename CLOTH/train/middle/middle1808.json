    "article": "Dear Mum and Dad, I will go to Kathy's home with her after school and I will have supper and sleep there. Don't worry about me. You know that Kathy is  _  of my best friends. If you want to talk with me, you can  _  88552828 after 6:00 p.m. Please forgive me for not telling you first. I  _  think you will allow me to do so. But I really think teenagers should be allowed to stay at their friends' homes sometimes. I am sixteen years old and I'm not a little kid any more. I hope I can make decisions for  _  . At home, there are too many  _  for me to obey: Don't wear short dresses; don't stay out so late; don't have meals before  _  hands; don't watch TV without finishing homework; and so on. Parents should  be strict with  teenagers, but we need freedom, too. I don't like doing my homework at home. I'd love to  _  with Kathy. We always learn a lot  _  each other. So please allow me to stay at Kathy's home once a week. If you  _  , Kathy can stay at our home with me, too. Mum and Dad, I can take good care of myself. Don't worry. Yours, Lillian",
