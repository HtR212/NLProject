    "article": "Last week our school held a sports meeting. Everyone in our class felt very  _  because we  _  many matches. In the boys' relay race, Michael  ran  very fast and our class won the first place. Alice did well  _  the long jump and she also won. We're sorry that we did  _  in the high jump than other classes, but we're sure we could do better next time. I took part in the boys'  400-meter  race. I did my best and was the first  to pass  the finish line. This encouraged  _  a lot. Now I love sports better and I think nothing makes me more comfortable  than taking exercise everyday and I believe some day I  will be  able to be the best soccer player and take part in the Olympic Games.",
