One day he had an idea. He went around the village with a basket and asked each person  to give  him some of their wisdom . The people laughed at Anansi because they knew that he needed wisdom the most.  _  each person put a bit in his basket and wished him good  _ .\nSoon his basket was  full , but Anansi was worried that his neighbors might be jealous  of his wisdom and take it  _  him. He decided to hide it at the top of a tall tree. When he had tied the basket to the  _  part of his body, he tried to climb the tree, but it was too difficult. He tried again and again  _  success .\nThen his son walked  _ . \"What are you doing, Father?\" He asked and Anansi told him. \"Why don't you  carry the basket on your back instead?\" His son said.\nAnansi put the basket on his  _  and climbed the tree easily, but he wasn't happy. \"I walked all over the village and collected so much wisdom  _  I am the wisest person ever, but my baby son is still  _  than me. Take back your wisdom!\" He said. And he threw the basket of wisdom into the air and went home. And that's  _  wisdom went all over the world.",
