    "article": "Smiling is the best way of making friends. When I was thirteen  _  old, my father found a job in the city. So my family moved there. I also came to a  _  school near where we live. My old school was far away. At first, I did not know anyone in my class. I was very lonely  _  I was afraid to make friends with my classmates. I  _  talk to anyone about my problem, and I didn't want my parents to  worry about  me. Then one day, something good happened. I was sitting at my desk  _  as usual while my classmates were talking happily with each other. At that moment,  a boy  came into the classroom. I didn't know who he was. He passed me and then turned back. He looked  _  me and, without a word, smiled. Suddenly, I felt happy, lively and warm. That smile changed my life. I started to talk with the other classmates and made friends. Day by day, I became  _  to everyone in my class.  Thanks to  the smile, I have moved on to a new life. Now, I believe that the world is what you think it is. So smile at the world and it will smile back.",
