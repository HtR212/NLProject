But some classmates said they had to study for the test. Wang Mei said we could have the party on Friday. That's a  _  idea. So we decided to have it on Friday afternoon. There are only four days left. We  _  prepare for it right now. We plan to invite some of our teachers. Our monitor is going to bring them  _  the party without telling them about it. we're sure that they will be  _  . I think of some games to play at the party. If one wins the game, he/she  will get  some small gifts. Wang Mei is going to organize some shows  _  singing and dancing. Should we ask our classmates to bring food? I'm afraid that  _  we ask them to bring food, they'll just bring some junk food. So we will bring some fruit and vegetables, and we can make salad by ourselves.  _  we will have a good time. We can't wait.",
