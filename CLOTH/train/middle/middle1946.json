    "article": "I recently started learning German.I wanted to start writing _ in German as soon as possible,but I didn't want to _ mistakes and teach myself bad habits.I wrote my first e-mail in German after reading just one short (40-page)book for learners _ in simple German,a few e-mails from a German friend,and after _ my very small word collection for a few months.And my e-mail in German had almost no mistakes.\nHow was that _ --writing correct sentences after getting so little input ?My e-mail included very simple sentences. _ the most important thing was my research:I looked for example _ on the Web and in dictionaries.\nI _ a lot of time on each sentence.It took me more than an hour to write my first e-mail,which included only a few German sentences.\nThe writing process was long and it _ much effort ,but it was fun.The experience was very encouraging and it made me even more _ in German.Perhaps one of the reasons why it was so enjoyable was that I knew I was building correct sentences.",
