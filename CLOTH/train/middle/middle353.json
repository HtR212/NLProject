    "article": "Early last year, two young brothers in Jiangsu Province  _  badly burned while playing. The\"game\"they were playing was  _  they had watched in the cartoon Pleasant Goat and the Big Big Wolf (<<>> ).The brothers were  _  two little goats while their friend was playing a bad wolf . Their friend tied them  _  a tree and set fire to the grass around them. The sad story is an example of how many children follow the violence they see on television, especially cartoons. It is  _  that violent cartoons can make children more aggressive . In a survey, researchers  _  the children after watching non-violent and violent cartoons. They found that the kids who watched violent cartoons fought with others and  _  class rules more often. Children under the age of seven are too  _  to understand that the violence on TV can bring  _  real harm. It is parents' job  to help  them understand it.",
