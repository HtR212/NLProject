We have to use them very often. We say them when someone gives us a drink,  _  us to pick up things, lends us a book or gives us a gift. Another important word is \"please\".Many people  _  to use it. It is rude to ask someone to do something without saying \"please\".We have to use it when we  ask for  something, too. It may be a book  _  a pencil, more rice or help. We have to use \"please\" to make request pleasant. We have  to learn to say  \"Sorry\",too. When we have  _  someone, we' ll have to go up and say we' re sorry. When we have forgotten something, we will also say \"sorry\".We can make people  _  wrongs by saying it. These three words are  simple but important  .Our children must learn to use them. They are pleasing words to use in any languages.",
