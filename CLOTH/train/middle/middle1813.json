    "article": "Making friends is a skill like most skills. It _ practice. If you want to meet people and make friends, you must be willing to _ some action. You must first go where there are people. You won't make friends staying home alone. Joining a club or a group, talking with those who like the same things as you do is much easier. Or join _ in some activity.\nMany people are nervous when talking to new people. After all, meeting strangers means facing the unknown. And it's human nature to feel a bit _ about unknown. Most of our fears about dealing with new people come from doubts about _ . We imagine other people are judging  us, finding us too tall or too short, too this or too that. But don't forget that they must be feeling the same way. Try to accept yourself _ you are, and try to put the other person at ease . You'll both feel more comfortable.\nTry to act self-confident even if you don't feel that way. When you _ a room full of strangers, such as a new classroom, walk straight, look directly at other people and smile. If you see someone you'd like to _ to, say something. Don't wait for the other person to start a conversation.\nJust meeting someone _ does not mean that you will make friends with that person--friendship is based on mutual  likings and \"give and take\". It takes time to _ .",
