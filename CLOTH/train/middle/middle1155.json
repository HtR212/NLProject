We should thank Miss Anna Mjarvis. She brought up the idea of having such a day. She lived in West Virginia. Her mother  died  on May 9, 1905. She had a deep love to her mother. She  _  letters to some important persons. In her letters, she asked them to decide a day for  all  mothers. Then Mother's Day was made on the second Sunday in May by the US in 1913.
