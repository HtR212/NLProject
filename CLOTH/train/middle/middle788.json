    "article": "When one door of happiness closes, another opens. However, we often look at the  _  door so long that we can't see the one that has been opened for us. It's true that we don't know  _  we've got until we lose it, and it's also true that we don't know what we've been  missing  until it goes away. Giving someone all your  _  doesn't mean that they'll love you back. Don't expect love in return. Just  _  for it to grow in their hearts. There are many moments in life when you miss someone so much that you want to bring them into your  _  and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream, go where you want to go, and  _  what you want to be,  _  you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do. Happiness lies in those who have cried, those who have been hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can understand the  _  of their lives. The  _  future will always be based on a forgotten past. You can't go on well in your life until you let your past failure and heartaches go.",
