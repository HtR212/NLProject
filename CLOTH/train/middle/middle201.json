    "article": "Many people believe that 3G mobile phones will be used in almost all everyday activities. It  is thought  that we won't go shopping because most things will be available on the Internet. There will be no more  _  because all texts will be available in electronic libraries. The Internet will be used to plan holidays, rent films and  _  food. Most telephone calls will be  _  by 3G mobile phones as well. Some people are  _  about the new development. Others, however, don't think that 3G mobile phones will replace the old  _  of shopping and communicating. Let's look at books, for example. Some people believe that one day we won't read books made of paper.  _  , we'll read books by using 3G mobile phones. These mobile phones will store the contents of many different books at the same time. We won't need to turn lots of pages and paper will be  _  . Is the Internet shopping as fun as traditional shopping? Many people say it's not. It's  _  to go into shops and look at things. It's also  _  that most people will want to read books on their 3G mobile phones. Maybe 3G mobile phones won't change these two habits.",
