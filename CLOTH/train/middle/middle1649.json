When I was in Grade Seven, my teacher asked us to  _  something about green food by ourselves. We had no idea at first. Then our four-member group had a  _  and went to do some research in a supermarket. Two of us wrote down the names of the  _  food on the shelves. The other two  _  customers some questions like \"Do you know what green food is?\" \"How often do you  _  green food?\" and so on. More than 30 customers  _  our questions! Later each group in our class wrote a research report  _  the topic and handed it in . Our teacher chose the  _  ones and put them up on the wall of the classroom.  _  was one of them! We not only learned a lot about green food but also knew how to keep healthy.",
