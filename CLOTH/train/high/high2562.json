Tell me and I can make it come true for you, for you're my pet. But remember, you can only tell  _  .\"\n\"  _  ,\" he said unwillingly. \"I have a lot of wishes.\"\nGod slowly shook his head, \"There're too many beautiful things in the world, but life is limited, so no one can possess all. Once you make a  _  , you will give up others. Come on, choose carefully, with no  _  .\"\n  _  , he asked, \" Will I regret?\"\nGod said, \"Who knows. Choose love and you will have to  put up with  the emotional torment; to choose wisdom means pains and loneliness; choose money and you will have the trouble  _  brings along. There're too many people who regret that they should virtually take another way  _  they've gone one way. Think about it carefully, what do you really want in your lifetime?\"\nHe thought and thought, all desires  crowding in  and fluttering around him. Which one was the one he couldn't give up? Finally, he said to God, \" Let me think, let me think.\"\nGod said, \" But you  _  be quick, my son.\"\nSince then, his life was filled with the constant  _  and balance. He used half the time of his life to make lists and the other half to tear them up because he always found himself  leave out  something.\nDay after day, year after year, he was no longer  _   . God came to him again. \" My child, haven't you decided your wish yet? But you only have five minutes  left  .\"\n\"What?\" he exclaimed. \"Over the years, I haven't enjoyed the joy of love. I haven't accumulated  _  and haven't received wisdom; I haven't gotten all I want. My God, how can you take away my life at this time?\"\nFive minutes later, no matter how  _  he pleaded, God couldn't help but take him away.\nLife is like this: everywhere is alive with choices. Since it is impossible to have everything, you should learn to make a choice; if you're  greedy for  everything, perhaps you can only achieve  _  in the end.",
