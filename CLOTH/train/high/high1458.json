    "article": "The day before Christmas I pulled into a store parking lot and counted my money again. It wasn't much. I   _   being poor, not having enough to   _   my small children a few simple toys. As I was   getting out    I noticed the Salvation Army  bell ringer at the   entrance    . I felt bad again because I didn't feel I could   _   anything to give him. I started walking towards the entrance   _    two cars entered empty parking spaces in front of me. The first was a   _   , new Cadillac which became the   _    of me the moment I saw it. \"How   _  \", I thought, \"would it be to have enough money to buy a car like that!\" The second car,   _  , was an ancient car more shabby than the one I was driving.\nA man got out of the Cadillac and hurried into the store   _   past the bell ringer without a second   _  . Out of the old car came a young mother with three small children following   _  behind her. Her clothes looked as   worn out   as her car, yet she stopped at the entrance and   _   a bill. In that second a(n)   _    touched me, my envy and dislike    _    me, and all the love and joy filled me. I fished a bill out of my own purse,   _    it in the Salvation Army kettle, and wished the   bell ringer    a \"Merry Christmas!\"\nNow I felt I was a poor man but rich on the   inside   . After finding a few things for my kids, I drove home with my heart singing.[",
