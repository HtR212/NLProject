This is one such   _  .\nWhile I was attending a party being   _   at a high school one evening, I looked around and noticed a young girl who looked   _  . I thought she had been a(n)   _   of mine. I tried to remember her   _  , but I couldn't. I felt so frustrated  ,   _   I have always been able to   _   former students.\nHer eyes met mine and she threw her   _   around me and said, \"Mrs. G, it's me, Sarah, and I'm still   _  !\" The memories   came back  . You see, Sarah was   _   a student in my classroom. Sarah's mother had abandoned   her, and her father had   _   her. She was sent to live with her grandparents the year I   _   her. Sarah was angry, often in   _   and often in the office.\nIt was during one of those   _   visits that I first met her. She was writing. I introduced myself to her and asked her   _   she was writing. Sarah shared her story with me. I knew it was healing   for her to put her   _   on paper. Every morning before school she would come into my classroom and we would work on her writing skills.\nOur conversation that evening was filled with   _  . She expected to go to college. Driving home, I could not help but   _   the impact   for both good and bad that teachers have upon their students. Taking the time to   _   with a child has the power to change that child's life. That's why I teach.",
