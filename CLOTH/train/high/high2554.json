Apart from that, I had to learn how to make deeper and more meaningful.   _   with people.\nMy struggle with mental health was something that   _   into a campaign to let every single people know that they   _   and couldn't be replaced. At high school, it could be   _   to convey this idea, but I   _   pursued my passions .

I tried to   _   as many names as I possibly could. I had started a club   _   gave students a safe place to express themselves and learn how to apply empathy in their everyday lives. On my personal social media account, I posted weekly suggestions to   _   both myself and my friends.\nAs I go off the college this year.
