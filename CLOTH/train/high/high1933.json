She was full of  _  . \"Do you know  _  you and I are?\" she asked.  _  I could answer, she gave out the reason for her question. She had just returned from renewing her driver's license at a government office. The woman  _  desk asked her what her \"occupation\" was. Emily hesitated,  _  how to answer it. \"What I mean is,\" explained the woman, \"do you have a job, or are you just a ...?\" \"Of course I have a job,\" answered Emily. \"I'm a (an)  _  .\" \"We don't  _  'mother' as an occupation ... 'housewife' covers it,\" she said. I forgot all about her story  _  one day I found myself in the same situation. This time it was at our own Town Hall. The clerk was a woman. \"And what is your occupation?\" she asked. What  _  me say it, I do not know.

I'm working for my masters (the whole family) and already have  _  credits (all daughters). I often work 14 hours a day (24 is more like it). The job is more challenging than most jobs and the  _  are in satisfaction rather than just money.\" There was an increasing note of  _  in the clerk's voice as she  _  in the form. As I drove into our driveway , I was  _  by my lab assistants -- ages 13, 7, and 3. Inside the house I could hear our new experimental model (six months) in the child-development program. I felt successful. Motherhood...what a great  _  .",
