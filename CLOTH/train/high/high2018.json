    "article": "It was my seventh year teaching first grade. \nOne mid-March day, the kids were at break between classes, in expectation of the coming carnival at noon when something terrible happened, on a child's level   at least   -- someone stole the Twinkie out of Abby's desk.\nIrritated, I stopped all morning work,   _   its return. \nNo Twinkie appeared.\nFive hours passed, but the class still sat with their heads down, listening to me   _   on the importance of honesty and being   _   for one's own mistakes.\nI was really sweating it out. Was I   overreacting   ? No, my heart told me. All we needed was the   _   .\nMy afternoon aide arrived. A mother of four, she   _   to take the kids one by one into the hall for questioning. \nWhen the time came for   _   to be questioned, it was over within a minute. He came back into the classroom, tears filling his eyes, hands shaking, hanging onto the doorway   as if   he'd collapse if he let go. He took deep breaths, trying not to cry. \"I took the Twinkie. I'm sorry,\" he said in a small voice. Then he covered his face with his hands in   _  .\nI was livid . We had been lied to for more than five hours, with nothing   _  . Something must be done, so let the ones who   _   throw the first stone. \"Does anyone have anything to say to Peter?\" I asked.\nThere was   _   for at least a minute. Perhaps the kids were measuring their words...\nThen, one little girl   _   her hand. She stood straight and said in a strong voice, \"We   _   you, Peter.\"\nThe words   _   through our heads. Forgiveness... one of the last things Jesus taught us as he was dying on the    _  . Forgiveness.\nSuddenly, all twenty-eight kids raced to Peter and   _   him with hugs and pats on his back, cheers, and laughter. It was like the prodigal son had returned home.\nI learned that day how forgiveness heals. How good it feels to say, \"I forgive you,\" and how49 _  it is to hear that you are forgiven.\nAnd the Twinkie? Abby never did eat it. She gave it back to Peter with a   _   hug and smile.",
