    "article": "I had a very special teacher many years ago whose husband died suddenly of a heart attack. About a week after his  _  , she shared her insights   with the students. When the class was nearly over, she   _   and said, \" I would like to   _  with all of you a thought that has    _  to do with class, but which I feel is very   _  .\n\"Each of us is put here on the   _  to learn, share, love and appreciate ourselves. None of us knows when this   _   will end. At any moment it can be   taken away  . Perhaps this is life's way of telling us that we must make good   _   of every day.\" Her eyes beginning to  _  , she went on saying, \"So I would like you all to   _  me. From now on, on your way home, find something   _   to notice. It doesn't have to be something you see - it could be scent   of fresh bread, or it could be the   _  of the wind slightly rustling  the leaves.\"\n\"Please look for these things, and   _   them. They are   _   observing, for at any time they can all be taken away.\" ks5u\nThe class was totally quiet. We all picked up our books and went out of the room   _  . That afternoon, on my way home I noticed   _   things than before. Every time I think of that teacher and remember what a (n)   _  she made on all of us, I try to   _   all of those things that sometimes we all ignores. For as we get older, it is not the things we did that we often regret,   _   the things we didn't do.",
