    "article": "It was a bitter cold evening in northern Virginia many years ago. The old man's beard was covered by winter's frost while he41 _ for a ride across the river. The wait seemed  _  . His body became numb and stiff from the severe north wind.\nHe heard the faint, steady rhythm of approaching hooves on the43 _  path. Anxiously, he watched several coming horsemen. He let the first one pass by without a(an)  _  to get his attention. Then another passed by, and another.  _  , the last rider neared the spot where the old   _   sat like a snow statue. As he   drew near  , the old man said, \"Sir, would you mind giving an old man a  _  to the other side? There doesn't appear to be a passage by foot.\" Controlling his horse, he  _  , \"Sure.\" Seeing the old man was  _  to lift his half-frozen body from the ground, the horseman h  _   the old man onto the horse. He took the old man not just across the river, but to his  _  , which was just a few miles away.\nAs they neared the tiny but  _  cottage, the horseman's curiosity caused him to ask, \"Sir, I   _  that you let several other riders pass by without making an effort to demand a ride. Then I came near and you  _  asked me for a ride. I'm curious why you wait and ask the last rider. \"\nThe old man56 _ himself slowly down, looked the rider straight in the eyes, and replied, \"I've been there for some time. I think I know people pretty good. I  _  into the eyes of the other riders and immediately saw there was no  _  for my situation. But when I looked into your eyes, kindness and  _  were evident. I knew your kindness would give me assistance in my time of need.\"\nThen, Thomas Jefferson turned his horse around and  _  his way to the White House.",
