    "article": "I'm an operating engineer, running crane in New York City. I was in the countryside, playing golf when we got the call that a plane had  _  the World Trade Centre. We checked out of the hotel immediately and started  _  our way downtown. When I got home, I called the rescue center and they told me to come  _  and get on the  _  list. The next morning I went down to the  _  at about 5 A. M., and four hours later I  _  the call to come down to West Street. I called my wife and told her not to  worry about  me, and that I would stay in  _  with her. I took the subway. It stopped at West Fourth Street, so I had to  _  the rest of the way. And somewhere in there I became  _  when I went into something I  _  . I once worked there in 1966 for the  _  of the World Trade Centre. On halfway on September 12, I was frightened to see the World Trade Centre was a huge pile, maybe ten  _  tall. And it was burning. I started to ask  _  in which my crane might be  _  a whistle blew suddenly warning us of some danger. I saw people running away and I really didn't know what to do. So I did the same, too. It was as if they had  _  the bulls go in Spain and we were running through the street. People falling down, people  _  them up as they came by, and carrying them, just to get them out of the way, because something was extremely  _  . I didn't even look back. We stopped running when we got to the Battery Tunnel, and I caught my  _  and said, \"Oh, my God, I'm going to die.\" Then I  settled down  a little bit, thinking about what we should do next. As we started again we knocked into a fire chief officer and we asked, \"What can we do to help you?\"",
