All, however, had a serious  _  .\nThree were in wheelchairs, one was nearly blind and two walked with difficulty,\nand another two  _     a lot from Cerebral palsy  .\nMatthew was among them. His hands, arms, legs, and even his voice were all distorted   from the disease. To speak, Matthew had the help of a   _  . Slowly, and with determination, he\nwould  point out  with distorted hands, letter by letter,\nwhat he wanted to say. Yet he was always bright and cheerful and loved to  _  everything his classmates were doing, both in the boat and in the\nclassroom.\nThey learnt fast and enjoyed every minute of the   _  . But I think that 1 was the one who learned the greatest lesson. One day\nthe sailing centre was  _  by a storm. Rather\nthan  _  the activity we decided to work in a\nclassroom. All the children  joined in  . Just like other\nchildren they all wanted to answer the questions I asked.\nOften they would loudly   _  each\nother, trying to give an answer before one of the others.

But the   _  they afforded to Matthew with his most severe\ndisabilities was  _  . If only the rest of the world\nwere able to learn to afford care, respect and help to someone less  _  than themselves, violence and intolerance   would possibly be gone.",
