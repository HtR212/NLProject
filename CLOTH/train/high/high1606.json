With a gradual  _  to twelve to fourteen hours for toddlers one to three; eleven to thirteen hours for  _  three to five; and ten to eleven hours for schoolchildren  _  five to ten. But things get really  _  at adolescence. Not only do teenagers need more sleep than  _  ---eight and a half to nine and a quarter hours a night, according to the sleep foundation - but the times  _  which they get sleepy and are able to awaken  _  and feel rested shift in a  _  that does not match to the  _  times at most schools. Sleep studies have shown that the typical teenager does not fall asleep readily before 11 p. m. or later.  _  many have to get up by 6 a. m. or  _  to get to school for a class  _  starts at 7:30 or 8 a.m. More than a few  _  off during that class, and often the  _  one as well. Even if awake, they're in no condition to learn much of anything. In one study, more than 90 percent of teenagers  _  they slept less than the  _  nine hours a night, and 10 percent said they slept less than six hours.  _  James B. Maas, a Cornell University psychologist and Leading sleep researcher, has observed, most teenagers are \"walking zombies \"  _  they get far too little sleep.",
