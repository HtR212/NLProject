Those emotions are   _   with us when we arrive home. How do we   _   them? We let them out on whoever may be the   _   person in the line of fire. It could be our wife or husband, children and even the dog or cat.   _   this behavior is not respectful, we have all done it.\nWe understand this part of being   _   and we learn to deal with it. Usually we say sorry for our bad behavior later to the man we hurt. But kids so not get   _   ! They don't   _   that it's just because we are human or it's just a reaction to something totally unrelated. We may raise our voice,   _   , or even slam a door. We may even   _   our child a fool and ask them   _   they are so stupid?\nTo a kid this is hurtful and   _   , which can cause anxiety and a   _   of confidence. The more it   _   , the worse the child feels. It can affect their social life, school life and even life at home, causing them to become   _   , or turn inward. These emotions   lead to   much worse behavior if not dealt with.\nChildren need to be   _   with respect and honesty. Once hurt happens, make sure we   _   to that child, get his full attention and wholeheartedly   _   for our loss of control. Take full   _   for our actions.",
