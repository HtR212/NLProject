    "article": "Two or three years ago, I was very envious of the \"cool\" girls in my class. They chose   _   clothes in grown-up stores while I was still   _   at Children's Place. In fact, I was   _   of wearing jackets and jeans every day. This condition   went on   for quite a while, lowering my self-confidence and making me burn with   _   whenever I saw a girl who was better dressed than me. With my parent's credit card in hand, I   _   all the clothes I ever dreamed of owning.\nOn the first day of a new term, I put on my new   _   and headed out of the door. Not surprisingly, it was the most   _   day of my life. Everybody was looking at me in a strange way, the new girl,   _   the style that made me feel like I was nothing more than a(n)   _   only playing at being me.\nSince then, another year has come and gone, bringing many new   _  . Very quickly, I realized it was a mistake to   _   others and only wear the clothes the \"cool\" girls were wearing. What was more   _   was finding a style that fit my personality. I used the clothes in my closet to   _   my own style, which didn't make me fear but gave me   _  .\nI   _   that if you are not comfortable with what you are wearing, you will not look   _   no matter how fashionable your clothes are. Being fashionable comes from within yourself, not from the clothes you wear. The   _   here is not to be afraid to break out of your shell, but break out for the   _   reasons, in the right direction. In other words,   _   the way you want to, not the way others say you should.",
