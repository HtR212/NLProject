    "article": "It was the beginning of the school year a few .years ago. l had a little boy in my class who was very quiet and  _  . I wasn't sure how much he understood during the school day and I was especially  _  that he just stood by himself at  _  time and did not play.  If l tried to talk to him,  he would turn away and  _  shut his eyes to  _  from me.\nAfter a couple of days, I decided to seek  _  from one of my outgoing and  _  little girls. I called her over and asked her if she would get him to  _  , and I started talking about all the  _  . on how she could start communication with him I  _  she could try this idea or that .She  _  my arm to stop my talking and looked up at me in that  _  way that only a six-year-old can,  and  said, \"Don't  _  ,  I speak kid\".  And she ran off.\nI stood there all alone,  _  watching her.   It took less than a minute for the two new friends to run off,  hand in hand,  _  joining a game of tag.\nI often think of that small  _  . about what I learned and how  _  it is for all teachers to speak kid.  I know-my  _  should be on teaching students how to think and how to  figure out  solutions. We must be ready to learn from our  _  a because those  \"teachable moments\" during the school days are for us. the teachers,  as well as our kids.",
