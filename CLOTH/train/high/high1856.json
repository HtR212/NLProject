As we entered the door, two sounds  _  us. The sleigh bells of last year made that sweet, peaceful tinkle as we opened the door. The other sound was the electronic beeper that reminded Andy of our  _  . \"Good afternoon, Ryan,\"  _  the cheerful greeting. Andy was a very  _  sort of owner. He was of medium build and height, and the smile on his face welcomed us. We walked across the old wood floor. Andy asked us what he could help us with. I told him we were  looking for  ).

But what Andy said that day rang in my ears. And it rings in my ears today. That's a tall order to live up to. It's a high standard of  _  .My father made a fame for that name, and I get to enjoy the benefits. But on account of this, I must maintain that fame. And that's  _  business.",
