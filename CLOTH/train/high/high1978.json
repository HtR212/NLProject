    "article": "As China's economy grows rapidly and more people choose to raise one child, it is very   _   for young men or young women to care for the aging   _  . Young people always complain that they   _  too much pressure with caring for the   _  . How the aging people can be cared well is a   _  topic in recent years. In my opinion, we, our government and our society can do   _   as follows:Firstly, our government should adopt more  _   measures to make the elders have enough pensions . Then the elders will  _  that they can support themselves and needn't   worry about  their living expenses.Secondly, I think that every young people should take   _  to care for their old parents. Young parents have taken great efforts to bring you   _  . So when they get old, you should let your parents know   _   you care about them and you can do something for them. The most important is not to make your parents feel   _  .\nThirdly, the whole society should be   in favor of   elders' activities. The society should provide necessary   _   for the elders to take part in activities.   _  the activities, they can enjoy the happy time with their friends and other elders.\nIn conclusion, I want to   _   that elders are very important to our society. They have done   _   contributions to our society. When they grow old, they   _   more respect from us, especially youth. Let's   _   more attention to elders' life.",
