Once we realized that we were separated from our group, we   _   tried to find a safe place to set up our base. We found a small area next to a   _  . Then we started a fire with some leaves and sticks  _   nearby.\nWhile I was   watching over   the fire, Ned brought more   _  , which were put in the water and then slowly thrown into the fire. The   _  leaves created a lot of smoke. Then we started to write some  _   notes saying, \"WE ARE LOST! If you find this   _  , you will find us upstream. We are keeping up a(n)   _   fire. Please find us!\" They were made into paper   _   and sent downstream, one every five minutes. We   _   that these boats would draw somebody's attention.\n  _   our group was well on their way, we wanted to be ready for them. Ned and I started to   look for   two hollow logs   and some strong sticks. Our small fire  _   produced plenty of smoke. Soon we were very   _   to hear whistles   far in the distance. It must have been the smoke that worked. Now it was time to start   _   on the hollow logs. We enjoyed this part  _   we got to sing and shout along with the beat  . Soon after, we were   _   by our group and we headed back to our camp with a (n)   _   story to tell.",
