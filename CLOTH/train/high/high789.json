We can't   _   the opportunities to come to us.We must take action to   _   what we want!\"\nAfter this talk.I waited in   _   to meet Jack and asked for his personal e-mail address.Over the next several months,I sent him e-mails   _  my vision and dreams.He kindly e-mailed back simple    _   such as \"Keep thinking and playing bigger;it's much more fun that way.Love,Jack.\" Then my life got   _   with other things.I lost sight of my inspiration and I   _   e-mailing Jack.\nA year later,my dream gradually faded.I had this idea if I got back in touch with Jack.I   _   him again and again-but got no   _  .As I sat down at my computer to check my email for the fifth time,I    _   woke up.What was I doing? Was I waiting for the   _   of life? Instantly,an inspiration came like lightning:We all have a \"Jack\" for whom we   _  . Why not write a/an   _    about this waiting and call it \"Waiting for Jack\".\nThree years later,Waiting for Jack is a best--seller on Amazon! And I have grown in ways I   _  expected.",
