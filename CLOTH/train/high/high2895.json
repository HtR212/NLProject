    "article": "I drove a school bus as a part-time job. Thirty-nine children all had stories to tell me about their summers. Charlie though  _  me. From the first day on Charlie was  _  . If a fight broke out I didn't have to turn my  _  to know who had started it. If a girl was crying chances were that Charlie had  _  her hair. No matter how I spoke to him gently or  _  he wouldn't say a word. He'd just  stare at  me with those big gray eyes of his. One day I found a small tin heart on the bus was gone. \"Does anyone know  _  happened to the little heart here\" I asked. Some children cried \"Charlie  _  it Search him\" When I asked him to come forward his gaze( )  burned into  my eyes. I stuck my hand into one of his pockets. Then I felt it--the  _  outline of the small tin heart. Charlie stared at me for a long time. There were no  _  in those big gray eyes no plea( ) for mercy. He seemed to be waiting for what he'd come to  _  from the world. I was about to pull the tin heart out of Charlie's pocket  _  I stopped myself. Let him keep it, I said \"It must have fallen off before I got here.\" Without a word Charlie  _  to his seat. When he got off at his stop, he didn't so much as glance at me. Several days later just that  _  Charlie moved away... A dozen years after retirement we met in the street. To my  _  , he hugged me. After he let go, he pulled something from his pocket and held it up for me to see. An old key chain... bent out of  _  , the lettering faded . You  _  probably guess what it was--the little tin heart. \"You were the only one who kept trying.\" He explained. We  _  again and went our separate ways. I am so  _  I'd done a good job.",
