    "article": "The elderly Chinese man in the small booth behind the thick glass shook his head. I didn't need to know a word of Chinese to understand there were  _  beds available for the Thursday night train from Beijing to Shanghai. I had a Friday morning  _  with my college friend. I must be on that train. Desperate times  call for  desperate measures. So I squatted . I assumed that this was the international  _  for \"Are there any hard seats available?\"  _  , there were. It was seat 109. Very quickly, I found it. The Chinese man sitting in it, however, seemed to beg to differ. I panicked. I am a man who usually avoids conflicts and so I  walked past  my seat, as if still looking, to buy myself more time. I had two options: The first is to be a  _  and ask for what was rightfully mine. The second was to  give up  and spend the next 13 hours staying in a corner. Well, nine out of ten times I choose the second option. But at that moment, every square inch of  _  had already been claimed. There wasn't  _  a corner in which to cower . So, I mustered up some  _  and presented the man with my proof of ownership. He looked at my ticket and  _  . About midnight my  _  became heavy and I was ready for the lights to dim and my date  _  Ms ZZZZ to start. But the room  _  bright and hot. I tried to persevere and was even able to work  _  into a sleeping position. It is here I must admit: I have a  _  bladder . The man next to me drank a Coca-Cola, a bag of milk and a bottle of water and  _  the course of 13 hours he did not move once. I drank  _  but finally, I made my way to the bathroom at 3:02 am. After waiting in a thick cloud of cigarette smoke, I finally used the bathroom. The philosophy of my sleeping  _  was right: if you get a seat on a train, don't move.",
