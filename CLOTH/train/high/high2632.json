When Grandey was  cleaning up  a large pile of pine needles and dirt at the end of her hard work day, she never  _  to come across someone's diamond ring lying alone among a pile of  _  . Knowing the ring probably had special  _  , Grandey held onto the jewelry and made it her  _  to find the owner. \"I said, 'Oh God ,I have to find the  _  , \"'recalled Grandey before making the decision to contact the TV station, to help  _  the word. \"It was definitely a  _  ring. It was intertwined and had their  _  on it.\" Her efforts  paid off  . \"The brother of the girl saw it on  _  and told her,\" said Grandey, who couldn't have been happier to return the  _  ring to its original owner, Julie Sanalitro. \"I was screaming and running around the house,\" Sanalitro told the news station. \"We always come to  _  our tree from there to celebrate Christmas Day,\" she said. When Sanalitro called to  _  the ring, she explained it was a gift from her boyfriend, who had only given it to her two months ago when they  _  reunited. She was not only able to  _  answer all of Grandey's questions about the ring,  _  she was the original owner, but Grandey added, \"I knew it was hers the moment she was walking up.\" \"We just hugged each other and she had a few tears,\" the  _  volunteer explained. All that Crandey asks from this  _  is simply for people to \"pay it forward.\" She said. \" I would want someone to give it back to me if I lost my ring, so just try to pay it forward.\"",
