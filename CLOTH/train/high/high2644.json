    "article": "Several years ago I started riding a bike. At first, I thought it was only a   _   ride. But as I built up strength, my friends encouraged me to try some longer   _  . The first one to come along was a 150-mile journey, an event held every year that   _   money to fight cancer.\nWhen I signed my name, the   _   seemed great--to support a worthy cause while going for the   _  --and I trained with great excitement. But as the time for the ride approached, my   _   gained ground over my endurance . I still wanted to raise money, but I didn't really want to   _  all those miles for two days straight.\nThe ride began on a Sunday morning in the Georgia countryside,   _   for the first few hours I felt wonderful.this was just the   _   I had imagined, and my spirits were   _  . But by the end of the day, I felt tired. I was sure I'd have to   give up  .\nAs I topped the hill, the nice sunset   _   me going for a few minutes more. Then in the distance, I   _   a lone rider riding very slowly. I   _   that the person looked different in some way, but I couldn't tell   _  . So I managed to catch up. There she was, riding along slowly but steadily, with a(n)   _   smile on her face -- and she had only one leg.\nMy focus   _   at that moment. I'd been doubting my body for a whole day. But now I knew -- it wasn't the body, but the   _   that would help me reach my goal.\nIt rained all the second day. I   _   saw the one-legged biker again, but I pushed on without complaining. And at the end of the day, still feeling   _  , I completed the 150thmile.",
