It's a(n)  _  thing that she shares with a movie star she'll be meeting later this year--a star whose life story is coming to a theater near you this month. Who's the star? A dolphin named Winter. And  _  is not the only thing that she and Isabel have in common. Winter lost her  _  when she was a baby. She got it caught in a trap used to  _  crabs. Isabel, who had a similar experience to Winter, once had a  _  life.  _  , when she was 2 a tumor on her foot  took away  her leg. Now, both Winter and Isabel  _  artificial limbs. In Isabel's case, it's an artificial leg and foot. In Winter's case, it's an artificial tail. In November, Isabel will travel from her home to Clearwater, Florida, to  _  Winter. Clearwater is the site of the aquarium where Winter has lived since she was  _  from that trap. According to the Kitsap Sun, the meeting was set up by the man who designed Winter's artificial tail--Kevin Carroll. Carroll also  _  artificial limbs for people. He and Isabel  _  met last month in Bremerton, Washington, at the  _  where she got her artificial leg, which freed her of the  _  that had troubled her for years.  _  Carroll met Isabel and found out she wants to be a veterinarian , he decided to set up the meeting. She  _  people who've lost limbs by  _  them they can still do the things they used to do. According to the Kitsap Sun, she plays softball,  participates in  karate competition and chases after her dog, too. For years, she didn't know anybody else who had an artificial limb. Now, she's about to meet a movie star who has one, too. And she no longer feels so  _  . \"I think it's pretty cool,\" Isabel told Kitsap Sun reporter Chris Henry. \"Winter has an artificial tail. That makes me think that I'm not the only  _  one. There are thousands more.\"",
