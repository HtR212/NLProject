Suddenly, Eric screamed with  _  and said, \"Hi there.\" His fat baby hands hit the high chair tray, and his eyes were wide with excitement.\nI looked around and saw the  _  of his enjoyment. It was an old man with a worn and oily coat. And his hair was uncombed and unwashed. I was sure he  _  . His hand waved. \"Hi there, baby; I see you,\" the man said to Eric.\nMy husband and I  _  looks. Eric continued to laugh and answer, \"Hi, there.\" Everyone in the restaurant noticed this. My husband and I were  _  .\nWe finally  got through  the meal and  _  for the door. My husband went to pay the check and told me to meet him in the parking lot. The old man sat  between  me and the door. \"Lord, just let me out of here  _  he speaks to me or Eric,\" I prayed. As I drew closer to the man, I turned my back trying to sidestep him and avoid any air he might be  _  . As I did so, Eric leaned over my arm, reaching with both arms in a baby's \"  _  \" position. Before I could stop him, he had  _  himself to the man's arms. Eric, in an act of total  _  and love, laid his tiny head upon the man's ragged shoulder.\nHis  _  hands full of dirt, pain and hard labor gently, so gently, cradled  my baby's  _  and patted his back. I stood amazed. After a while, he pushed Eric from his chest  _  as though he were in pain, saying \"God bless you, ma'am. You've given me the best Christmas gift.\"\nI had just witnessed a genuine love shown through the innocence of a tiny child who saw no sin , who made no  _  . The ragged old man,  _  , had reminded me that a genuine love is one in which the  _  meaning of love is realized.",
