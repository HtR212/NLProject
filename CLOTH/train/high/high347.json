    "article": "Allan Paul, a final year engineering student, was considered as a safe driver by all who knew him. One sunny morning, Allan was on his way home from his friend's house on his favorite bike. All of a sudden, due to a major  _  by a truck driver near a traffic signal, Allan's bike was hit by the huge truck. Poor Allan lost his legs and was  _  in the middle of the road, trembling. He cried out for help but no one troubled to  pick him up  . They were afraid of the consequences they could face if they gave Allan  a helping hand  . There was a huge crowd gathering,  _  Allan like he was an alien. Allan kept crying and shouting aloud and finally he  _  his body to the sidewalk. Then he saw a man getting out of a car. Allan  turned to  him and cried out, \"Please help me. I want to live. Save me, I am  _  .\" The man ran over and  _  . He picked up Allan and took him to the hospital. Allan gave him his  _  number and the man then called Allan's house to inform his parents about the  _  and their son's situation. Allan's parents rushed to the  _  ; the doctors told them there was no  _  and asked them to take Allan home since it was impossible for him to  _  . Allan asked his parents to only  _  one person when he died, the man who had helped him. He also requested that they not inform or allow anybody else to see his dead body. Allan  passed away  the same night. As was Allan's last  _  , his father called only that man and informed him about Allan's  _  . Only a person, who has a  _  heart and who offers his service for the good of his fellow human beings, is a man. Those who  _  to, remain animals forever.",
