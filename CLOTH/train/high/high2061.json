    "article": "I grew up in a small town and the main entertainment was Friday night high school football. It was just a sleepy little town where parents wanted to raise their children away from crime and  _  of a big city, and where teenagers like me  dreamed of  leaving to find something bigger and better. All that changed one summer night. My friend Lisa, Martin and Tyler held a party for my eighteenth birthday at Lisa's house.  _  they kept handing alcohol to me I was pretty  _  . I asked Tyler to take me home. With some  _  , we made it out to his car and drove home. News came next morning. My friend Martin was  _  in a car accident. That night after Tyler and I left, Martin, who was  _  more drunk than me, got into his car and  _  towards the highway to go home. Driving on the wrong side of the road, he never saw the truck coming. The driver didn't see him  in time  to avoid the car. They hit head on. Martin died immediately, and the driver was thrown  _  the truck windshield and died a week later. Whenever I  _  back on that day, I can't help thinking that it was my  _  to drink so much that night.  _  things would be different. I know Martin  _  the choice to drink and drive that night, but a part of me will always feel  _  for what happened. I may not change the world with my story, but I do hope that by  _  my story I can make you  _  that you not only have a responsibility for yourself but also for others. Don't ever think that your choices are yours  _  . Every choice is like a stone dropped into  _  water--each ripple represents someone who your choice  _  . That's quite an influence, isn't it?",
