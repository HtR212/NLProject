They wanted to   _   that women could do the same work   _   men.\nTheir underwater house was made of steel, and was in two parts. Each part had two rooms . One room was the wet chamber( ). Another was the \" control center\". The third room was   used for   food and equipment. The fourth was the living room. There they could eat, sleep, listen to   _  radio and watch television.\nThe scientist explored the sea four or five times a day. Sometimes they even worked during the night. They  watched   different kinds of fish. Plants and other things were gathered from the seabed. When necessary, they    _   photographs with special cameras.\nWhen they left their underwater home, they felt quite  _  .

If men can  find   oceans on the moon, we'll go and explore them too.\" They answered.",
