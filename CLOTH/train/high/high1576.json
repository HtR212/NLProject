Pointing to  the working builders,the contractor replied,\"Look at my workers!I can't remember all their names,and even I have no  _  of some of them.Most of them wear blue shirts.But if you look  _  ,you will notice a sunburned man in red.He seems to be working harder than others.He is always the first one to work while the last one to leave.It is exactly his red shirt that makes him  stand out  .Soon he will be  _  to my assistant.You know,that is also how I got  _  I am now.I worked hard and wore a striped shirt.My boss  _  me.I also became a boss eventually.\" Success can only  result from  action.Working hard is all winners' shared experience for achieving their dreams.",
