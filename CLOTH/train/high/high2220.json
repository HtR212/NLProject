It had been with me as I  _  hard to support my family,as I played with my children and heard their  _  and even when I was  _  with my wife at my side looking after me.It had been with me as I raced towards that stupid banner.I just didn't have the  _  to see it. There is an old Chinese proverb that says,\"Tension is who you think you should be.  _  is who you are.\"Perhaps we all should stop our race towards the  _  life we think we should have and  _  the life we have now.Happiness will never be found under some banner far away.It will be found  _  your own heart,soul and mind.It will be found when you  _  that others love you just as you do. Don't be a tortoise or a rabbit when it comes to your happiness.Be a playful puppy and carry your stick of  _  with you everywhere you go.  _  yourself out of the race and realize that when it comes to love and happiness,you are  _  there.",
