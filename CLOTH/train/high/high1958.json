    "article": "I was aged 9 the moment I discovered my father was seriously sick. It was 1994, but I can well remember my mother's words as though it were yesterday: \"Maggie, I don't want you to take   _   from your father, because he has AIDS. Be very cautious when you are around him.\"\nAIDS wasn't something we talked about in my country when I was growing up. From then on, I knew that this would be a family   _  . My parents were not together anymore, and my dad lived alone. For a while, he could attend to himself. But when I was 12, his condition worsened. My father's other children lived far away, so it   _   to me to look after him.\nWe couldn't   _   all the necessary medication for him, and because Dad was unable to work, I had no money for school supplies and often couldn't   _   buy food for dinner. I   _   sit in class feeling completely   _  . The teacher's words were   _   as I tried to figure out how I was going to manage.\nI did not   _   my burden with anyone. I had seen how people   _   to AIDS. Kids laughed at classmates who had parents with the disease. And even adults could be   _  . When my father was   _   to the hospital, the nurses would leave his food on the bedside table even though he was too fragile to feed himself.\nI had known that he was going to die, but after so many years of keeping his   _   a secret, I was truly   _   when he reached his final days.   _   and down, I called a woman at the non-profit National AIDS Support. That day, she   _   me on the phone for hours. I was so lucky to find someone who cared. She saved my life. I was 15 when my father   _   on. He took his secret away with him, having never spoken about AIDS to anyone, even me. He didn't want to call   _   to AIDS. I do.",
