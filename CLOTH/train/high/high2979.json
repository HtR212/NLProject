And she always held an optimistic point of view toward her condition,  _  I guessed she knew that there wouldn't be much improvement. I actually asked why in a  _  way, and she said to me the very sentence. It was not spoken very clearly, since her stroke had  _  the movement of her tongue. I was not moved then, since after spending a few months in this hospital, I was almost  _  .\nAnd that old lady had  _  stroke a few days later, which made her unable to speak or move anymore. I thought she would be  _  as others, lying there, waiting the day, and crying sometimes. But I was wrong. She still held that someday, somehow, she would fully  _  , though both she and I knew the possibility for that was extremely small.\nThen, the very sentence she said  made sense  to me. A patient with absolute no hope still held the optimistic aspect in her life, regardless how  _  it was. How could I lead my life in that way? Since then, I've tried harder and worked harder. I would not give up my life either.",
