When I was one and a half years old, we lived in our first house in Rue St-Louis. On a hot summer day, my father intended to  _  the roof of our old house. In order to climb up there, he  _  In my town,  _  could walk outside because the streets were  _  . I was outside watching my father climb on that strange thing. I was curious about why my father disappear at last. So I decided to go up it to  figure out  why it was impossible to see my father after he reached the  _  of that thing. At 1.5 years old, still a baby wearing pampers, I climbed that ladder to the roof top and started walking  _  . My father did not notice that-he was on the other side occupied with his repairs. It happened that a nice lady in our  _  passed by and  _  me. The nice lady came to my house and  _  my mother of it, who was fearful and  _  ran outside to speak with me. She really thought I would just  fall off  that roof, for I was just a baby  after all  . She asked me to sit down and stop moving in a  _  way you speak to your babies when they are cute.  _  , I threw myself flat on the  _  and waited. My mother climbed the ladder to  _  me up and there I was enjoying the view laughing at my mother's shocked face.  _  the saying goes, \"He who knows nothing  _  nothing.\"",
