First of all, mistakes are a clear  _  that you are trying new things.It's always  _  to try new things because when you are trying new things you are  _  .If you never try anything new, how can you  _  ? The simple answer is \"You can't\".With few exceptions, every single detail of development is the  _  of someone trying something new. When you are making mistakes, you are  _  .Edison failed 10,000 times before he  _  the light bulb.When asked how it felt to  _  that many times, he said that he hadn't failed 10,000 times, but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't  _  . Finally, when you make a mistake you are much  _  to success.Why ? When all is done, you will have tried some number of things before you succeed.  Every time  you make a mistake you eliminate one of those things and are one step closer. But this all doesn't mean that you should go ahead  _  considering the consequences of a mistake.Quite the contrary, when you try something new, you  have to  be willing to set some reasonable limits, so that in the event that it doesn't  work out  the way you want it to, you will be in a position to try again. We all have  _  resources in time and money, so don't blow them all on one  _  to a problem.Realize that it probably won't be perfect the first time, and allocate these resources properly so you can learn,  _  corrections, and try it again.Only by  _  and using your mistakes in this way, can you make significant  _  . As an old saying goes, \"If you're not making mistakes, you're not trying hard enough.\" So go  _  and make mistakes.And learn.And grow.And succeed.",
