    "article": "Galina was born with an illness called Spina Bifida. Because of her disability, she has only had a little   _  . Her parents were   _   of her and never allowed their friends and neighbors to see her. Her mother often   _   her because Gailina could not control the things her body did. This made her think that her disability was all her   _   and that she must have done something wrong. She spent the next four years in   _  . She liked it better there because she was with others who had disabilities. She did not feel   _   from everyone else. But when she went back to live at home, she realized just how different she was from all her brothers and sisters. She was so   _   that she tried to kill herself. But she did not succeed. Soon after this, she left home and found work in a big city.\nOne day a group of Christians visited her. They told her about Jesus Christ who loves all people, even those who are   _  . She was not interested because when she was a child she was taught another   _  . But the Christians did not   _   seeing her. Then she began to realize that their friend, Jesus Christ, loved her. She found a new friend in Jesus. Galina does not feel rejected any more. She feels   _   and loved by God. Her    _   with her parents has changed too. One time when she went to see her parents, her mother asked Galina to forgive her for the many times she beat her when she was a child.\nYou may have been   _   hurt or treated as a child. You may not have had the education you hoped for like Galina. You may not be able to do the things you want because your family is   _  , or one or both of your parents died when you were young. There are many reasons why you might think badly about yourself. What did Galina find out made all the   _   to her life?",
