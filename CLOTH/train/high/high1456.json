    "article": "Smiling is the most desirable human behavior. We tend to overlook the power of smiling,   _   can work out many wonders and miracles.\nIn my spare time in the State, I loved to take a walk around the small community where I lived.   _   I met on the way, they always gave me a friendly greeting accompanied with a nice smile as soon as our eyes had   _  . Spontaneously , I smiled back. This kind of smiling exchange represented the most   _   part of my jogging experience in the State.\nWhen it comes to doing business, my   _   is \"I love to see my customers smile\". If a customer smiles when he sees you, it means he feels comfortable   dealing  with you. More importantly, it means he makes money. If he can make money, I get the business rolling.\nOn a personal note, my daughter's giggle  is just like   sunlight   which warms my inside the same way   as   the sun warms my body. It can   _   away any clouds and unpleasant feelings.   _   I see her photo, her giggle   _   around my ears. The little reserved and controlled smile of my wife,   _  , reflects the beauty of a matured and well-learnt woman. It is so   _   in my eyes. It can sometimes really turn me on.\nJulia Robert's   _   is nothing but roaring like earthquake or volcano. It can overtake men and women alike. Americans may   _   in many other ways, but they all agree that Julia is America's sweetheart. Nobody can   _   her laughter plays a very good part in her acting. Once I tried some candy in a store, the owner asked me how sweet the candy is, I said sweeter than Julia Robert. Both of us   _   into a kind of Julia's laughter.\nYes, laughter is something we can not do without. Otherwise, our life would be too gloomy.\nSmiling does not belong to human alone. Once I stayed at an American home   and   he had a little doggy by the name of Mini. Mini is a lovely pet. Every time we came home, she jumped up and down and insisted   _   giving me some lipping. When I held her gently and asked her to give me a little smile, she just   _   her mouth and half closed her eyes, looking like every inch of smiling. That left a deep impression on me.\nWhat I love Los Angles most is not only it is the place where it has sunshine most days in a year but also where most people smile!",
