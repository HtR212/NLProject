Of course, it couldn't.So the ant, after all this  33 _  and using great brightness, overcoming problems a1l along the way, just gave up the  34 _  and went home.The ant had not thought the problem through     _   it began its journey and in the end the feather was 36 _  more than a burden.Isn't our 37 _  like that?\n     We worry about our families; we worry about the 38 _  of money; and we worry about all kinds of things.These are all burdens --- the things we pick up along life's path, and drag them around the obstacles and over the cracks that life will bring, only to 39 _  that at the destination they are 40 _  and we can't take them with us.",
