That evening, I   _   the bag to find dozens of shells, each one   _   in white tissue paper and having Mom's handwriting.\nThe shells were pretty   _  , but to Mom, they were evidence of her endlessly magical life and   _   me of the seashore trip with her. She was 61 when she   _   these shells, and already showing   _   of the lung disease. We knew something was   _   and Mom needed an adventure. She suggested a dinner and a movie. But two friends and I had bigger   _  .\nMom had been to the ocean only twice, but she   _   the seashore. Her kitchen was decorated  with souvenirs from those two trips. I told Mom that we would   _   for Jersey Shore. Mom was so   _   that she screamed and Amber, her dog was   _   to jump onto the floor.\nOne of my favorite   _   on the road was a discussion about movies. Mom often got the titles wrong. \"Ohhhh,\" she said, \"what was that movie about a teacher at the boys' school?\" Before anyone could   _  , she shouted, \"The Dead Man's Poet!\" I looked back and saw a back seat full of   _  . \"Mom,\" I said. \"You mean Dead poets Society?\" \"That's it!\" Mom yelled.   _   filled the car.\nOnce we got to Stone Harbor, she began to   _   the trip, greeting strangers and spending hours gathering shells. The morning we left, I found her photographing every inch of her bedroom. \"I don't ever want to   _   this,\" she said.\nFor a long time, Mom's shells stayed   _   in a drawer. Last month, I   _   them again while searching for something else. I put them in a visible place as a reminder from a mother who never lost her sense of wonder.",
