She would scream and kick and  _  on the floor drumming her heels. Her parents always  gave in  . That was why she was alone on the  _  , wearing an expensive swimsuit. It has taken a massive tantrum to  _  her parents to buy it. They were back at the beach-house,  _  from the tantrum she had thrown when they told her that it was too dangerous to go diving  _  . \"Dangerous?\" she had said. \"You just don't want me to have  _  . I'm going and if you try to stop me, I'll scream.\" \"What are you doing ?\" a voice asked. Diane jumped. She did not know that the man was there  _  he spoke . \"I'm going diving, \" she answered. \"You shouldn't swim that day, \" the man  _  . \"There is a storm coming up.\" \"You should mind your own  _  !\" Diane replied and walked into the gentle waves. \"If you go out there you'll be  _  ,\" the man called after her. She did not bother to reply. Diane slipped into the water and dived  _  until white caps began rolling in and it became harder to  _  against the current . Saltwater hit against her face, making it  _  to breathe. Oh, why had she not listened to advice. Panicking, she began to  _  . Then, just as it seemed as if she would slip beneath the surface, she heard a  _  voice. \"Hold on ! I'm coming.\" With  _  , she saw the old man rowing an ancient-looking boat towards her. \"I hope you've learned a lesson. You put us both in  _  , \" he shouted angrily, as he dragged her over the side of the  _  . Gratefully, Diane thanked him and ran towards the beach-house.",
