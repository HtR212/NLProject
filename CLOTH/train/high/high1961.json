    "article": "Two weeks before Christmas a nine-year-old girl was walking with her friend down the street, sliding on the ice. They were talking about what they hoped to  _  at Christmas. They stopped to talk to an old man named Harry, who was  _  his knees pulling weeds from around a large tree. His fingers were  _  with cold. As Harry responded to the girls, he told them he was getting the yard  in shape  as a Christmas present to his mother, who had died several years before. His eyes filled with tears as he  _  the tree and said, \" My mother was all I had. She loved her  _  and her trees, so I do this for her at Christmas.\" His words  _  the girls and soon they were on their knees helping him to  _  around the trees. It took the three of them the rest of the day to complete the  _  . When they finished, Harry pressed a quarter into each of their hands. \"I wish I could  _  you more, but it's all I've got right now,\" he said. As they walked they remembered that the house was  _  , with no flowers, no Christmas tree or other decorations. Just the  _  figure of Harry sitting by his curtainless window. The next day they agreed to put their  _  in a jar marked \"Harry's Christmas Present\" and then they began to seek for small jobs to  _  more. Every nickel, dime, and quarter they earned went into the  _  . Two days before Christmas, they had enough money to buy new  _  and a Christmas card. On Christmas Eve they came to Harry's  _  singing carols. When he opened the door, they  _  him with the gloves wrapped in pretty paper, the card and a pumpkin pie still  _  from the oven. With trembling hands, he  _  the paper from the gloves, and then to their astonishment, he held them up to his face and wept.",
