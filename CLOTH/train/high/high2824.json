I stayed in bed, feeling upset because there wasn't enough money to buy me the  _  that I'd wanted that year.\nMum came back with some snow in her hair. \"Come on, Matt!\" she said. \"Dress  _  ! It's freezing cold out tonight.\"\n  _  , I went out in the cold with Mum and climbed up the sled beside her. She pulled it around the house and then stopped in front of the woodshed . She went in and  came out  with an armload of wood.\n\"I rode by Jensen's today,\" said Mum, \"Little Jakey was out digging around in the snow. They're out of wood, Matt.\"\nJensen lived about two miles down the road. Her husband died 3 months ago,  _  three children, Jakey being only 8 years old.\nWe loaded the sled high with  _  .
