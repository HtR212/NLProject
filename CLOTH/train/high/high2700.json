    "article": "It was silent in Mom's hospital room. Only the sound of her heart monitor interrupted the  _  moments of what seemed to be a peaceful sleep. It had been several hours since her operation. I wanted her to wake up. I needed to  _  to her. Last night, I shouted at her because she had allowed my  _  sister to visit her when she had  _  our mom for years. \"Shame on you!\" she had said firmly. \"Moms don't stop  _  their children just because one of them chose to leave her. A mother always loves more than she's loved  in return  .\" I thought, \"Shame on you! When I do something wrong or when a friend is  _  to her, that's all she will ever say. How about standing up for you  _  for once, Mom?\" My mom's groaning broke my  _  . she couldn't speak,  _  her eyes were moving, looking for something. She  pointed to  her notebook and pen next to her bed. I gently handed them to her. She  _  slowly, and then turned the notebook around for me to read. \"I forgive you,\" it  _  . Tears ran down my face. I felt  _  . As I began to speak, I was  _  by the loud arguing of two seemingly angry nurses on the opposite side of the room. My mom suddenly began writing on her notebook, and then stopped to  tear off  the piece of paper. She handed it to me, signaling me to give it to the nurses. They read it, looked  _  at my mom and quietly left the room. \"What did you write, Mom?\" I asked. She smiled sweetly but said nothing.  _  , I knew what she had written on that piece of paper. How  _  those three little words are! I kissed my mom goodbye and  _  to find my sister.",
