    "article": "In a recent airing of \"Unsolved Mysteries\", there was a young boy who was the victim of the  holocaust .He'd been 36 _  in a work camp for several years and somehow had managed to  survive the    _  0f his imprisonment.\n    The story was of a boy - now in his sixties - and his quest to find an American soldier who had 38 passed on  a kindness to him by   _   some food. It might seem    _  ,but to this child, who had seen  nothing but  _  and inhumanity for42 as long as he could remember, it was a  _   that marked a  turning point in his life, for he had lost hope .When he was liberated by the American forces, he was  dying. He,44 _  needed food. As he was staggering along the road ,a young soldier   _    down from his tank and gave him some of his supplies.    _   this one act of generosity, a kind American had  aroused the    _    again that there really was some good in the world. And the boy never    _   it. The boy later went to America, raised a family , became successful and worked hard to repay the  _  he had received with his own.\n    Actually there were so many similar acts of generosity that it would be almost impossible to know   for sure   who the soldier was.\n    We all have a choice: to create more light in the world. As Confucius    put it  over 2500 years ago, \"It is better to light one small candle than to  _   the darkness.\"\n    As the story above so nicely   _   .small gestures can often generate huge   _   .If we're  constantly    looking for  and doing kind acts, we will no doubt bring more joy into the world around us as  well as into our own world!",
