So God reached into the ground again and took some more stuff from the earth. This time he made every kind of animal and every kind of bird. He brought them all to Adam to see  _  he would call them. It must have  _  a long, long time to think up all those  _  ! Luckily, he didn't call them things like 'Foo Foo' or \"Snuggems\"or 'Pooky' or anything like that.  _  , he called them 'gerbils' and 'rabbits' and 'rhinoceroses'. And he  _  the birds 'eagles' and 'egrets' and 'ruby throated warblers'. Well,  _  , we don't know what Adam named them,  _  he didn't speak English. But he named each kind, and that's important because people are the only ones that name things. Your  _  knows what a squirrel is, but he doesn't call  _  a squirrel. He just barks  _  it! But naming things is one of the things that shows we are  _  from all the other creatures that God made.  _  even with all the animals around to keep him company, God saw that Adam was  _  sad. Monkeys are fun to play with, but they don't have very much to say and they have  _  table manners. So God made Adam fall  _  , and while Adam was sleeping, God took one of his ribs .God took Adam's  _  and he made a woman from it. When Adam woke up, God  _  Eve to him , and Adam said, \"At last! Here is  _  like me! Her bones were made from my bones, and her body was made from my body. I will call her 'woman' because that means she was taken out of man.\" At last Adam was  _  . And so Adam and Eve lived together in God's garden.",
