    "article": "Lyse Doucet lives a happy life in Chicago. But recently there is some difficulty for her and her family. She and her husband have each other's parents and young daughter and for that they are  _  . But she and her husband are both currently  _  . And their car is in great need of  _  . And then there is the matter of their second child, who is  _  soon. So things are a little tense for the Doucet family these days.\nWhen Lyse and her daughter were walking through a store  _  lot recently, Lyse picked up an envelop from the ground that  _  $4,000 in cash. There were a  _  of different explanations that could be considered. Was this a kind of good  _  ? Could it be an attempt by the universe to balance everything? Could it be simply a gift from God? Lyse didn't know. The only thing she knew was that the cash in that envelope  _  to someone else. Oh, and one other thing she knew was that her young daughter was  _  . \"My kid was standing right there  _  I found it,\" Lyse told WLS-TV in Chicago. \"So basically I wanted to teach my daughter how to be  _  . And for me that was enough.\"\nNever mind the bills that were  piling up  , or the car that needed to be fixed, or the baby that would come soon. When she  _  the money over to the police she was told that there was actually nothing illegal if she  _  it.\nThe police were able to return the money to the person who  _  it-- an old woman. And one can imagine the joy and  _  she felt when the police handed the lost envelop back to her. \"She came to my house and she was almost in tears,  _  me,\" Lyse said. \"She gave me a hug and an envelope with a small  _  in it. But what was in it wasn't  _  . What mattered was the opportunity to teach my daughter honesty.\"",
