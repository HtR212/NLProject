    "article": "Who designed the first helicopter ? Who  _  some of most famous pictures in the world? Who knew more about the human body than most  _  of his time? There is an answer  _  all these questions --Leonardo da Vinci (*) Leonard may have been the greatest genius  people  have ever known. He lived in Italy around the year 1500, but many of his inventions seem modern to us today. For example, one of his notebooks has drawings of a helicopter. Of course, he couldn't  _  a helicopter with the things he had. But scientists say his idea would have worked. But Leonard  wasn't just  an inventor. He was one of the greatest artists of his day. By the time he was twenty years old, he was called a master painter, and as he got older he became  _  more famous. Sometimes he drew a hand in ten different ways  _  he was ready to paint. Many of Leonardo's wonderful paintings are still with  _  today. You may know one of his most famous works-- the  _  woman known as the Mona Lisa.",
