    "article": "Do fight against painting pollution Do you know what kind of things the young people are reading? More and more  _  and teachers have noticed another kind of pollution, which comes from the printed papers  _  on streets. These printed things  look like  newspapers but have hardly anything to do with  them  . You can only find reading materials badly made up there--some are too strange for anyone to  _  ; others are frightening stories of something  still worse  . However, many of the young readers are getting interested in such  _  reading, which  _  them what they should pay for their breakfast and brings them nightmares and immoral ideas in  _  Homework is left  _  and daily games lost. These sellers stand about on streets selling their papers well. The writers, publishers and printers,  _  they are, we never know, are  _  their silent money. The sheep-skinned wolf's story seems to have been forgotten once again. Why not  _  this kind of thing? Yes, both teachers and parents have asked each other for more strict control of the young readers.  _  , the more you want to forbid it, the more they want to have a look at it.  _  you may even find several children, driven by their curious natures,  _  one patched paper, which has traveled from hand to hand. It really does  _  to our society. It has already formed a sort of moral pollution. The  _  teachers and parents need more powerful support in their protection of the young generation. At the same time, the young  _  need more interesting books to help them  get rid of  those ugly paper.",
