One such memory is a phone call I  _  when I was about three or four years old. My mother had entered a contest on a local  _  show. Entrants were to tell an interesting story about their  _  . Winners would receive a phone call from Mrs. Santa Claus ! Mrs. Claus would award the lucky child free  _  of a local store. Well, the call came. My mother talked to Mrs. Claus and then  _  the phone to me. I didn't  _  the fact that many people were listening to our conversation. However, the fact that this lady had a  _  connection to Santa, that was important. I didn't know it yet, but my mother had  _  the attention of the contest judges by telling about the time I had  _  . Even I knew that this was not the kind of  _  that Santa would approve. Suddenly, in a very pleasant tone of  _  , Mrs. Santa Claus asked me about my art work. I  _  that this lady was the real Mrs. Claus, not a radio station actress standing in for her. I  _  down the phone and ran crying from the room. My crime had not  _  unpunished. Santa would  _  know that I'd been bad! It turned out that I did get a  _  present from the radio station and its sponsor . And I guess Santa didn't find out about the wall. Maybe he did and was in a  _  mood. In any case, my Christmas presents did not  _  . I wonder what Santa has in  _  for this year. Hopefully my wife hasn't written Mrs. Claus any letters.",
