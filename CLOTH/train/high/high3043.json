    "article": "A young girl just finished shopping with Mom in Carrefour. She looked 6 years old, with a beautiful brown haired,freckle-faced image of   _  .  It was   _   outside the market.\nWe all stood there under the awning inside the door of the Carrefour, waiting, some   _   while others annoyed, because nature   messed up   their hurried day. I am always   _   by rainfall. I get lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt of the world.\nSuddenly a   _   voice was heard, \"Mom, let's run through the rain.\" the girl said.\n\"No, honey. We'll wait until it   slow down   a bit.\" Mom replied.\nThis young child waited about another minute and   _   \"Mom, let's run through the rain.\"\n\"We'll get wet if we do.\"Mom said.\n\"No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning,\" the young girl said as she  _  at her Mom's arm.\n\"This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?\"\n\"Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, Believe in God and we would   get through   bad luck!\"                            \nThe entire   _   became dead silent. I swear you could hear nothing but the rain. We all stood silently. Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say.\nSome would laugh it off and   _   her for being silly. Some might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of   _   in a young child's life, \"Honey,you are   _   right. Let's run through the rain. If wet, maybe we just needed   _   .\"  Mom said. Then off they ran.\nThey held their shopping bags over their heads just   in case   . They got wet.   _   they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their own cars. Yes, I ran. I got wet. I needed washing.    _   or people can take away your   _   possessions, and your health but never take away your precious memories. So,don't   _   to take the opportunities to make memories every day!",
