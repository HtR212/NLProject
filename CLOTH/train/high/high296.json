    "article": "We have completed our first month of preschool. Matthew seems to  _  it. He is catching on to the routine quite nicely. I didn't leave him there  _  much the first couple weeks. I am finding if I'm not there he behaves much better. In this class a little German boy, who does not speak  _  ,cried all the time at first and now cries occasionally. The Monday of the second week the little fellow just cried and cried. He was sitting  behind  Matthew. I thought Matthew was going to start  any moment  and join in. I stood by and watched, ready for the rescue. Matthew kept turning around and  1ooking at  the boy. Then he reached his hand back and  _  him on the leg. He was comforting the boy! Later Matthew was playing with a  _  and the boy with blocks. Actually he was just standing by and crying. Matthew drove his truck over to the blocks,  _  it, picked up a few of the blocks and started handing them to  the little boy  . They then together started  _  towers on the table and the little boy  _  crying.It seemed  as if  Matthew knew what the little guy needed.Here was the little guy,who can't speak English,and Matthew,who  _  playing together,like they were best  _  . One of the days when I stayed,they were at lunch and Matthew was  _  at the table. I pulled up a chair to sit next to him.He smiled,then grabbed his book bag and took off running  across  the cafeteria.I took off after him.When we reached the wall he just giggled ,turned around and looked at me. I bent  _  to blame him for leaving his seat and running. He suddenly  _  .All I could do was to take his hand and  _  him back to his seat.Then I turned my back and couldn't help laughing.",
