He  _  me by telling me a little about his life -- how he had lost the battle with drink but how his  _  in himself has turned his life around. Now, when most men of his age will be  _  their retirement , he spent his time  handing out  papers to shops and strangers in the street. Yesterday Julie and I were back in the same coffee shop. Julie  looked over  my shoulder and saw the same man, sitting there with  _  a cup of tea. He dressed coldly despite the fact that the outside temperature was very  _  . We were having our dinner  _  , then I got up and walked over. Knowing he would not  _  me, I sat down beside him and asked, \"How's your  _  work going?\" He didn't remember me, but my  _  had told him who I was. He said, \"Wonderfully.\" \"And how about you?\" He replied, \"That doesn't  _  .\" \"Well, it does,\" I dared to suggest. \"You need to be  _  to keep on doing the good work.\" \"Like today,\" I said, \"it's cold out there. And it takes a lot of  _  to keep going on a day like this. My wife and I just had some soup and it was delicious. Let me get you some  _  you can try it.\" He shook his head, but I  _  him. A moment later, I took a hot bowl of soup and some bread in front of him. \"Enjoy them!\" I said and walked back to my  _  before he had a chance to  _  . Julie and I  _  our drinks and got our stuff together. As we walked past his table, I patted the man's shoulder and said, \"Just know you are  _  .\"",
