    "article": "It was the first day of kindergarten. I walked in with my mom and was  _  at all the toys against  the walls.  _  I ran over to them and started to play. Most of the other  _  were doing the same. In the corner, though, I saw one girl sitting  by herself  She was small and weak, the only one in the class  _  than me. Her red eyes  _  she had been crying. None of the other kids seemed to notice her.\nI was playing with the toy cars. When I  looked up  , I saw her sad and lonely eyes. Suddenly I felt something inside my heart  _  . I wasn't sure what it was. Being the youngest in my family I had become spoiled. My elder brothers always did  _  while I was free to play. However, that day it was  _  that I should think of someone other than myself. Finally, I  picked up  two toy cars and went over to her. \"Do you want to play?\" I asked . She smiled at me and  _  her head yes.\nWhat made me remember that first  _  act was a letter that little girl wrote to me after we both  grew up  . She told me how her illness made other kids  _  her and how my act had changed her  _  . She cherished  the friendship I had  _  . From then on we continued our friendship through the mail for several years  _  the bad health finally took her life.\nToday I still think of her and thank her for stirring something in my selfish  _  that day. I ask myself how a bit of  _  can move a heart, touch a soul, and change a life.",
