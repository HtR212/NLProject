They played jazz music to celebrate their new home. The loud   _   filled the room and made them feel very happy.\nThe next morning,   _  , their happiness disappeared. Someone had left a   _   under their door during the night. One of their neighbor had written to complain  about the sound of the piano. Dario's mother asked the building superintendent  if he knew anything about it. But he said that they were all   _   people and he couldn't imagine any of them had done that. Later that morning, Dario suggested that they write a letter to their   _   and apologize for their playing.\n\"Maybe we could go and   _   everyone in person.\" his mother said. \"What if we invited them to come here for a   _   instead? Dario asked. They both loved the   _  . Over the next few days, they sent out invitations and prepared desserts   _   their guests. They decorated the apartment with streamers  and party lights.\nFinally, the day of the party   _  . Some guests brought presents. Others brought flowers. Some even brought desserts to   _  . One woman, Mrs. Gilbert,   _   Dario's mother with a book of piano music by Chopin.\n\"I heard you playing the other night,\" she said. \"The sounds woke me out of bed. I   _   that you might play like this every night. So I wrote a short note. I hope you don't think I disliked the playing.\"\nDario's mother smiled at Mrs. Gilbert. \"I think maybe we   _   you an apology.\" she said. \"I didn't   _   how late it was when we were playing. Maybe we should play some quieter music at night.\n\"You play, you play!\" Mrs. Gilbert said. \"I like what you play! Just not so loud at night.\" She pointed to the book she had given them. \"These songs are not such   _   music.\"\n\"These songs are beautiful music.\" Dario's mother said. \"We will be   _   to play them in the evening.\"\n\"And we won't play so loud or late!\" Dario said. He was already looking forward to   _   the new music. More than that, however, he was happy to see the big smile on his mother's face. It gave him a feeling of   _   and made him feel that they were home at last.",
