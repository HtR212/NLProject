    "article": "It was the middle of third grade and I was not sure what had got into me. I lied about many things--I lied I had eaten all my dinner, when   _   I buried it in the trash can. I lied that I had   _  my bed, when clearly I had not. My lies were not   _   anyone, but for some reason I felt the   _  to tell lies on an impulse   that didn't feel like my own. I was labeled  a liar.\nOne day my   _   and I were invited to spend the weekend with my aunt. We all loved it as she   _   us very much. And she was an   _   artist. She had cool pencils, erasers and other supplies that any young girl would love to get her hands on.   _   it happened...someone   _  one of Aunt Kim's good art erasers and rubbed it across the entire top of the TV. The eraser   _  the shiny finish on the TV's casing. All the three of us were called into the TV room and asked to admit.   _   did! Aunt Kim told us how   _   she was.\nThe next thing I knew was that she was on the phone with my parents   _   they were on their way to picking me up. It   had to   be me! I was the liar. I argued, but no one   _  . And then before dinner there was a knock at the front door! Aunt Kid was standing there. It   turned out   that my younger sister finally felt guilty! She   _   that she was the one who rubbed the eraser on the TV. I was invited back!\nA lie may   take care of   the present, but it has no future. No matter how big or small your lies are,   _   you are labeled a liar, earning   _   takes a lot of work and time.",
