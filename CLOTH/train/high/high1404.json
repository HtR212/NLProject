But my wife and I were all on the beach in the coordinating outfits and we  _  wanted to get one good picture to  show off  our happy family, but it wasn't going so smoothly.\"\nCramer explains that to get the children to calm down, they try to  _  the boy's attention with some fun shots. And that's when things went  _  wrong.\nWe  _  them around a couple times, but the final time I heard my wife just go, \"Ahhhh!\" so I turn around and I see my son just  _  and peacefully doing this full layout back flip , landing flat on his back in the sand, Cramer explained. \"We were just  _  . \"\nThe couple says the baby cried for about two minutes  _  got over it and fine. \"He sniffled a little bit, \" said Cramer. \"But my dad is a pediatrician  and looked him  _  and said, ''Oh, he's fine.\"\nOnce the family realized the baby was  _  , they looked at the photos the photographer had taken and  _  they had Internet gold-the image has already tallied more than 2 million views since being posted on Reddit.\nWe got this incredible  _  . \"It's funny,\" Cramer said. \"Everything could have gone  _  , but it ended as best as possible.
