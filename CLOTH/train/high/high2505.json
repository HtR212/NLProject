    "article": "In 1982, Steven Callahan was crossing the Atlantic alone in his sailboat when it struck something and sank. He got into a life boat, but his supplies were  _  . His chances of surviving were small.  _  when three fishermen found him 76 days later, he was alive --much  _  than he was when he started, but alive. His  _  of how he survived is fascinating. His cleverness --how he  _  to catch fish, how he evaporated sea water to  _  fresh water--is very interesting. But the thing that  _  my eye was how he managed to keep himself going when all hope seemed lost, and there seemed no  _  in continuing the struggle. He was starved and  _  worn-out. Giving up would have seemed the only possible choice. When people  _  these kinds of circumstances, they do something with their minds that gives them the courage to keep going. Many people in  _  desperate circumstances  _  in or go mad. Something the survivors do with their thoughts helps them find the courage to carry on  in the face of  difficulties. \"I tell myself I can  _  it,\" wrote Callahan in his book. \"Compared to what others have been through, I'm fortunate. I tell myself these things over and over,  _  up courage...\" I wrote that down after I read it. It  _  me as something important. And I've told myself the same thing when my own goals seemed  _  off or when my problems seemed too terrible. And every time I've said it, I have always come back to my  _  . The truth is, our circumstances are only bad  _  to something better. But others have been through the much worse, that is, in comparison with what others have been through, you're fortunate. Tell this to yourself over and over again, and it will help you  _  through the rough situations with a little more courage.",
