The   _   is that we say them almost without thinking. The result of such a wish is that it   _   its meaning and power. \nLast month, I   _   Dada J P Vaswani's first speech after his return from the US. The   _   of his speech was \"In 2012, all will be fine\". While sharing one of his many   _   ideas, he said that while \"Happy New Year\" is a nice greeting, there's a more beautiful and encouraging way to   _   others--\"Happy New You!\"\nThose three   _   words show that New Year is a time to leave behind our   _   and step forward. It's the time to renew ourselves by getting rid of the negative things of the past --   _  , pain and so on. It's also the right time to give up thoughts of fear and failure.\nFor those who are   _   what to change, Dada has a simple suggestion: write down all the things that you don't   _   about yourself... every single one. They could be small or big, easy or difficult --   _   write them all down. Putting them on   _   brings clearness of thought, which is the first step towards bringing about any change.\nSo this New Year, let's wish each other \"Happy New You\" and then   _   that trend all through the year. Each time you wish others, you will be   _   not only them but also yourself to leave behind sadness and the past -- because it's time for being Happy and New.",
