    "article": "\"Forgiveness is the sweetest revenge.\" I saw this wonderful old saying again in a book recently. It got me thinking about all the times that I have been   _  to\nforgive others in my life and all the joy that it has brought me. One  _  stands out particularly well.\nI was a young boy at a summer camp. I was having a great time and   _   everything about it\nexcept for another young boy of my age. To say we didn't  get along  would be a statement that made the situation less\nserious than it really was. We spent most of the week irritating, insulting  , and picking on each other. \n  _   finally came to a fight on the next to last day of camp. We got into a fist fight which I lost.   _  older boys broke it up before I was hurt too much. I spent the rest\nof the day alone, refusing to speak and lost in my own  _  .\nThe next day my spirits were   _  when Mom brought the boys in our cabin some of her delicious homemade  _  . I was enjoying a few slices of it\nwhen I saw the other boy sitting by himself at the bottom of the steps outside.\nHe seemed very  _  right then. I am\nnot sure what moved me to do so, but I took my pizza down and  _  it with him. It made all the anger and pain inside me  go away  . We became friends after that. I never got into another fist fight either.\nI had found out that sharing and forgiving were much more fun and a lot less\npainful.\n   Forgiveness is   _  the\nsweetest revenge. It can turn an enemy into a friend. It can  _  a heart from the chains of anger, hatred, and pain. It can open a\nsoul to the sweetness of love and joy once again. May your life always be  _  of sweet forgiveness.",
