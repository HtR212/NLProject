I wandered about for an hour, looking for a likely  _  , feeling as though I were about to commit a crime. Then I  _  at last under a bridge near the station and decided to have a try. I felt tense and  _  . It was the first time, after all. I drew the violin from under the jacket like a gun. It was here, in Southampton, with trains rattling overhead, that I was about to  _  myself. One moment I was part of the hurrying crowds, the next I stood apart, my back to the wall, my hat on the  _  before me, the violin under my chin. The first notes I played were loud and raw, like a declaration of protest, then they settled down and began to run more  _  and to stay more or less in tune. To my  _  ,I was neither arrested nor told to shut up. Indeed, nobody took any  _  at all. Then an old man, without stopping at all, dropped a penny into my  _  as though getting rid of some guilty evidence. I worked the streets of Southampton for several days, gradually obtaining the truth of the  _  by trial and error. It was not a good thing, for instance, to let the hat fill up with money---the sight could  _  a kind-hearted man; nor was it wise to  _  it completely, which could also confuse him, giving him no hint as to where to  _  his money. Placing a couple of pennies in the hat to start the thing going soon became a  _  practice and I made sure, between tunes, to take off most of the earnings, but always leaving two  _  behind. Old  _  were most generous, and so were women with children, shop girls and barmaids. As for men, heavy drinkers were always willing listeners and so were big guys with muscles. But  _  a man with an expensive hat, briefcase or dog: respectable types were the least  _  of all. Except for retired army officers, who would shout \"Why aren't you  _  , young man?\" and then would over-tip to cover up their confusion.",
