And I remember one night in    _  when\nshe made dinner after a long, hard day at work.\nThat Monday evening so long ago, my mom   _  a plate of eggs, sausage, and extremely burnt toast   in front of my dad. I remember     _  to\nsee if dad noticed!  _  all my dad did was reach for his toast,\nsmile at my mom, and ask me how my day was  at school  . I don't\nremember what I told him that night, but I do remember watching him  _  butter and jelly   on that toast and eat every   _  !\nWhen I got up from the   _  that\nevening, I remember hearing my mom  _  to my dad for burning\nthe toast. And I'll never forget what he said: \"Baby, I love  _  toast.\"\nLater that night, I went to kiss Daddy goodnight and I asked him if he   _  liked his burnt toast. He  surrounded  me in his arms and said, \"Son, your mum put in a  _  day at work today and she's very  _  . Besides, a little\nburnt toast never  _  anyone!\"\nActually, life is full of imperfect things and imperfect people. We can't be   _  at everything we do.\nWhat I've learned over the years is that learning to  _  each\nother's faults and choosing to celebrate each other's  _  is one of\nthe most important keys to creating a healthy, growing, and lasting  _  .\nIf you learn to take the good, the bad, and the ugly parts of your life as they are, you can   _  your\nlife to the fullest.",
