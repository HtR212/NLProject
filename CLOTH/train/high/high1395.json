    "article": "Mark Twain said that \"habit is habit, and not to be flung out the window by anyone, but coaxed downstairs a step at a time.\" The chances of successfully changing negative behavior  _  when you make gradual changes that give you time to  _  negative patterns for positive ones. On any given day, countless numbers of us get out of bed and  _  to begin to change a given behavior \"today.\" Whether it be exercising more, drinking less, managing time  _  or some other change in a negative behavior, we start out with high  _  . In a short time, however, a vast majority of people fail and are soon doing  _  it was they thought they shouldn't be doing. After considerable research, some researchers believe that behavior changes usually do not  _  if they start with the change itself.  _  , they believe that we must  go through  a series of \"stages\" to adequately prepare ourselves for that  _  change. Once you have analyzed all the factors that  _  what you do, you must decide which behavior-change technique will work best for you. According to the psychologist Albert Ellis, most  _  problems and related behaviors arise from irrational statements that people make to  _  when events in their lives are different from what they would like them to be. For example, suppose alter doing  _  on an exam, you say to yourself, \"I can't believe I failed that easy exam, I'm so stupid.\" By changing this irrational \"catastrophic\" self-talk into rational,  _  statements about what is really going on, you can increase the  _  that positive behaviors will occur. Positive self-talk might be  _  as follows: \"I really didn't study enough for the exam. I just need to prepare for the next  _  .\" Such self-talk will help you to recover quickly from  _  and take positive steps to correct the situation. Some other technique like purposefully  _  or stopping negative thoughts and refusing to dwell on negative images can also spare you wasted energy, time and emotional resources and move on to positive changes.",
