    "article": "Thanksgiving is one of the biggest American holidays. And at the center of Thanksgiving dinner is the turkey. You may wonder why the word \"turkey\"   _   both a country and a bird that Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. Many think the bird comes from the  _  of Turkey. But turkey is not from Turkey. In fact, the fact that the turkey bird is called by that name is one big mistake. We could say it is a case of  _  identity.\nFirst of all, \"Turkey\" has meant the \"land of the Turks\" since   _  times. The word turkey,   _   to the bird, first appeared in the English language around 1540. And the misunderstanding   _   the word turkey happened because of birds that look   _  .\nThere is an African bird called the guinea fowl. This   _   bird came to Europe through Turkish lands. So, the English mistakenly called the male bird the \"turkey cock\" and called the  _  bird the \"turkey hen.\" It became  _  to eat the bird for Christmas dinner.\nWhen the  _  moved to North America, they saw a bird that looked like the guinea fowl, which at that time was called the \"turkey cock\" and   _   gave it the same name. So we now call this North American bird turkey even though it has no  _  at all with the country Turkey.\nAnd there is another piece to the puzzle. The case of mistaken identity crosses land and language  _  .The Turkish, for their part, call the North American bird \"hindi,\" the Turkish name for India. The reference to India probably comes from the old, wrong idea that the New World was in Eastern Asia. Sometimes, that is   _   language changes over time - by mistakes.\nAnother interesting fact about the turkey is that it  _  became the national bird of the United States. Some people thought it should be the  _  of the U.S.Founding father Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a   _   icon for the new country. He thought the eagle was \"lazy\" and \"of  _  character\" because it stole food from others. He thought that the turkey was a \"more   _   bird\" and a \"true original native of America.\"",
