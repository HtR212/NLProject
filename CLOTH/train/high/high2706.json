    "article": "The past 20 years have produced great advances in technology and communications. 31 As a result , people throughout the world have become ever more connected. The 32 _  link between the nations and people of the world is called globalization. It is a 33 _  that has changed ways of life around the world.\nPerhaps the biggest change in this process is the effect of globalization on commerce. In an effort to build a 34 _  economy, most nations of the world have embraced  free trade. Free trade removes certain limits imposed  on global commerce to make it easier for nations to exchange goods with one another. A 35 _  aim of this process is to aid poor nations and thus reduce 36 _ . Globalization has indeed increased trade throughout the world, but experts disagree about its effect on the poor. k*s5u\n \nThe debate about recent trends in global commerce is complex. Those 37 _  free trade in the global market point out that competition lowers prices. Its critics argue that, without controls, such a system often harms poor nations. To some extent, both are   _  . For example, in Jamaica, a country which imported milk from the United States and the 39 _  milk was cheaper than local milk, more poor people could drink milk and improve their nutrition. At the same time, the cheaper milk put 40 _  dairy farmers out of business. Perhaps this program caused as much harm as   _  .\nThose who support free trade in the global market do so for a number of reasons. Studies show that when a poor nation begins trading on the global level, it gains certain 42 _ . Its economy grows rapidly. Multinational companies set up factories, 43 _  jobs for people. Supporters claim that these factors reduce poverty and lessen the gap between the richest and poorest nations. They believe that the globalizing trend benefits the poor.\nCritics of unrestricted free trade question these conclusions. Although they 44 _  that the global market can offer growth and jobs to poor nations, they doubt that it reduces poverty. In fact, they cite  studies which show that poverty has increased as a result of the global market.   In addition  , the gap between rich and poor\nnations is growing.\nRegardless of which side they are on, most experts believe that globalization has great potential to aid the poor. Both sides need to find a way to make it work.",
