So I asked him, \"Keith, have I done anything that really   _  your\nfeelings?\"\nImmediately, he said, \"Yes, last Christmas you promised us a special   _  that I really\nwanted but you  _  gave it to me.\"\nThe   _  was\nthat I'd completely forgotten about it. I  _  , \"Is\nthere anything else I've done wrong, but I haven't apologized  _  ?\"\nAgain, his  _  was immediate, \"Remember last Christmas when Mom said you\nhad to go to the  _  because Kate, my little sister,\nwas going to be born? You left us at home and  set off  in a hurry.\nRemember?\"\n\"Well, you left and forgot the suitcase.\" I couldn't believe he  _  all the details!\n\"After you came back from the hospital you were  _  to see\nthe suitcase had been opened and  _  had been thrown\nall over the place, and then you  _  me.\"\n\"And you didn't do it?\" I asked.\n\"No, I didn't. I was just searching for my gift.\"\nMy heart sank. I felt   _  . I hugged Keith and asked him to  _  me. His honesty\nmade me think of my other son, Kevin. Maybe I'd hurt his feelings, too. I went\nto ask him the  _  question. Kevin answered as immediately as\nhis  _  , \"Last Christmas you promised us a special toy, but\nyou forget about it.\"\n  _  Christmas had passed, I took my two sons to the store that day and bought them what I had promised. The  _  thing wasn't the toy. The problem was that I'd made a\npromise too  _  and didn't keep it as their mother.",
