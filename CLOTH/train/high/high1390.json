    "article": "I am a team leader in an insurance company. We are going through a lot of changes right now, which is  _  much stress for all of us. A few weeks ago I was having a day so  _  that I even doubted if I had the ability to do this challenging work, and was about ready to change to a less stressful job  _  . Something happened that day to change my way of  _  and I am so appreciative of this young lady. I want to let her know that the small act  touched my heart  . On the top of my cubicle I have a small collection of lighthouses to let people know where I am sitting  in case  my team members have to find me for emergencies. That day I came into the office and was about to get the day  _  when Crystal came over. I asked if she needed anything. And she said, \"I  _  you something.\" I looked at her with a  _  look and said, \"Well, thank you, but why  _  you buy me anything?\" I had never spoke to this young lady  _  . She said, \"Every day I stand up and look across the  _  and see your lighthouses. Then I feel I am not alone and I encourage myself that there are always  _  things in life. I saw this on the way to work and thought  _  would like it. I wish it would have the same  _  as your lighthouses do.\" In her hand she had a small globe with a lighthouse and a ship on it. I gave her a hug and  _  her. I don't think she knows how much that small act of  _  changed my day: I remained  _  the rest of the day. For anyone that reads this, I hope you remember, no matter what the  _  is, you could change someone's day,  _  even his views on life.",
