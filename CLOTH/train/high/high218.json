In trouble, the 28 _  sent out the S.O.S immediately. Spotting the signal, the captain of the rescue team sounded the alarm and the villagers   _   on the beach. While the team 30 _  their way through the wild waves, the villagers waited anxiously, holding lanterns to light the way   _  .      \nAn hour later, the rescue boat   _   and the villagers ran to greet them. The 33 _  reported that the rescue boat couldn't hold any more   _   and they had to leave one man behind. Even one more would have  _  capsized the rescue boat and all would have been lost.\nTherefore, the captain called for another volunteer team to go after the lonely 36 _ . Sixteen-year-old Hans 37 _  forward. His mother grabbed (  ) his arm and said, \"Please don't go. Your older brother, Paul, has been lost at sea for three weeks. Hans, you are all I have 38 _ .\" \nHans replied, \"Mother, I have to go. What if everyone said, 'I can't go, let 39 someone else do it?' When the call for   _   comes, we all need to take our turn and do our 41 _ .\" Hans kissed his mother, 42 _  the team and disappeared into the night. \nAnother hour passed, which seemed to Hans' mother 43 _  a century. Finally, the rescue boat reappeared in the fog with Hans 44 _  on the boat. And he   _   yelled, \"We found him. Tell my mother it's my older brother, Paul!\"",
