She has got a 4.57 grade-point average,  _  a 2390 (out of 2400) on the SAT, and earned all 13 of her Advanced Placement  exams. She  _  a national non-profit program that encourages middle-school girls to  _  in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs. She has  _  developed a mobile app that analyzes speech patterns and predicts with 96 percent accuracy  _  a person has Parkinson's disease .\nOh, and she's 17.\nPooja earned admission to all eight Ivy League schools. Ivy League schools are generally  _  as the best universities worldwide. Earning an  _  letter from one Ivy League school is a rare achievement for most high school students. It is  _  rare for a student to get into all eight,  _  a few each year manage to do so. This year, Long Island student Harold Ekeh announced that he, too, had been accepted to all the Ivies.\nPooja's adviser, Kerry Hamblin, said that she worked very hard to  _  herself in the classroom, which helped her to be the best among her classmates. \"She's taking the hardest courses, the most  _  that we offer, and has succeeded beyond anyone's  _  in all of them,\" Hamblin said.\n\"She is really outstanding as a TJHSST kid  _  has taken the mission(,) of the school as  _  as it can go,\" said principal Evan Glazer. \"She's a STEM superwoman who  _  her interests in curious ways.\"\nPooja has taken classes in computing, artificial intelligence and DNA science. Pooja wrote one of her college application essays  _  being a woman interested in a career in computer science, a field strongly  _  mainly by men for a long time. She said she's often one of just  a handful of  girls in her technology classes. \"I want to encourage  _  in the field,\" she said.",
