    "article": "It is a true story behind a wellknown piece of art. In a village near Nuremberg lived a family with eighteen children. Merely to keep food on the table, the father worked eighteen hours a day. Despite their  _  condition, two of the children had a dream to seek their talent for  _  but they knew well their father would never be able to send  _  of them to Nuremberg to study at the Academy. The two boys finally worked out an agreement. They would toss a coin. The  _  would work in the nearby mines to support his brother. Albrecht  _  the toss and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, financed his brother,  _  work at the academy was almost a(n )  _  success. Albecht's woodcut and oils were much  _  than those of his professors and he soon was earning considerable fees  _  his works. When the young  _  returned home, the family held a festive dinner. Albrecht rose to toast to his beloved brother, \"Now, Albert, it is your  _  to seek your dream and l will support you\". All heads turned to the far end of the table, where Albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, while he  _  and repeated, \"No...no.\" Finally, Albert rose and  _  the tears from his cheeks. He said softly, \"I  _  go to Nuremberg, brother. It is too late for me. Look what four years in the mines have done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, and I cannot even hold a glass to  _  your toast.\" Today, Albrecht's masterful works  _  in every great museum in the world, but chances are great  _  you, like most people, are familiar with only one of them. Albrecht drew his brother's abused hands with palms together and the  _  stretched skyward. He called it simply \"Hands\", but the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and  _  his tribute of love \"The Praying Hands\". Next time you see that touching creation, take a second look. Let it be your reminder, if you still need one, that no one ever makes it  _  !",
