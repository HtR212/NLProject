His balance was shaky and he could easily be  knocked over  .His body was very rigid and his movements were never smooth.His writing was at most times unreadable, and speaking was difficult for him.Everything was a( n)  _  for John Doe.\nHowever, John loved  _  and would\ncome every day with a smile on his face.His determination to succeed was remarkable for a child so young who was facing so many   _     in his daily life.\nGetting back to the maths lesson, students were waiting to be called.One of those   _  hands was John Doe'\ns.\n         \"John, come on up and answer the question.\" I called. \nHe got out of his seat   _  and\nwalked to the front.His moving was  _  and with each shaky\nstep, it looked as if the slightest misstep could lead to him falling over.All eyes were on him.The class was   _  .He made it up to the board after spending so much energy to get there.As I gave him the chalk I thought to myself. \"What have I just done? Did I set him up to   _  ? What if he gives a wrong\nanswer?\" I was getting really  _  .\nGrasping the chalk and with great  _  ,\nhe wrote down the answer, which looked as if a kindergartener wrote it, but was\nat least  _  .Immediately a sense of   _  overcame me.\" Excellent job! John Doe, you are right!\" I said   _    .At\nthat very moment, my entire class spontaneously  began clapping for him.John stood there, smiling the biggest smile.He was admired for his strong will and   _     .\n         That moment left an unforgettable mark on my heart.",
