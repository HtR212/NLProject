    "article": "A businesswoman got into a taxi in midtown. As it was the rush hour and she was in a  _  to catch a train, she  _  a quick way to reach it.  \"I have been a taxi driver for 15 years!\" the driver said  _  . \"You don't think I know the best way to go?\"\nThe woman tried to explain that she hadn't  _  to annoy him, but the driver kept  _  . She finally realized that he was too annoyed to be  reasonable  , so she changed her  _  . \"You know, you are right,\" she told him. \"It must seem  _  for me not to think you know the best way  _  the city.\"\n  _  , the driver glanced at his  _  in the rearview mirror , turned down the street she wanted and got her to the train on time.  \"He didn't say another word the rest of the ride,\" she said. \"  _  I got out and paid him. Then he thanked me.\"\nWhen you find yourself  _  with people like the taxi driver, you will always try to  stick to  your idea. It can lead to longer arguments, lose job chances or  _  marriages.  I have discovered one simple  _  extremely unlikely method that can prevent the disagreement or other difficult situations from  _  in a disaster.\nThe  _  is to put yourself in the other person's shoes and look for the  _  in what that person is saying. Find a way to  _  , and the result may surprise you.",
