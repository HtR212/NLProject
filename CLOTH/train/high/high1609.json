Maybe it was the strange  _  things looked and sounded in my familiar room at night that  _  me so much. There was never total  _  , but a streetlight or passing car lights  _  clothes hung over a chair take on the  _  of a wild animal. Out of the corner of my  _  , I saw the curtains seem to move when there was no  _  . A tiny sound in the floor would seem a hundred times louder than in the daylight. My  _  would run wild, and my heart would beat fast. I would  _  very still so that the \"enemy\" would not discover me. zxxk Another of my childhood fears was that I would get lost,  _  on the way home from school. Every morning I get on the school bus right near my home--that was no  _  . After school,  _  , when all the buses were  _  up along the street, I was afraid that I'd get on the wrong one, and be taken to some  _  neighborhood. On school or family trips to a park or museum, I wouldn't  _  the leaders out of my sight. Perhaps one of the worst fears  _  all I had as a child was that of not being liked or  _  by others. Being popular was so important to me  _  , and the fear of not being liked was a  _  one. One of the processes of growing up is being able to  _  and overcome our fears. Understanding the things that frightened us as children helps us achieve greater success later in life.",
