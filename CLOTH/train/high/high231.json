Every morning since I got a smartphone, I've used The Weather Channel App to find out what to  _  . On the first morning I had to dress without guidance, but  _  I was able to guess that the day would be cold and foggy by looking out of my window. I couldn't tell what time it was. I haven't worn a  _  for more than a year, because my phone showed the time. So I was late for  picking up  friends who had been on the bus for two hours from Santa Monica to Palos Verdes. I was also late for my part-time job. And  even worse  , I couldn't call people to tell them that I was running late. Getting places was harder, too. I got  _  because I couldn't use the GPS on my phone. My driving, though, got a lot  _  because I no longer had my phone in one hand checking directions while  _  with the other. But the number one trouble was not having my contact list . I forgot to write down my friends' and family members' phone numbers before I  _  the challenge. It was sad to realize that I couldn't  _  my brother's and my mom's cell phone numbers. Oh, how I wished to turn on the phone for just a second to look up phone numbers! Even with all the problems, however, I found  _  not worrying about missing a text message or an e-mail. This  _  was a great learning experience. It surprised me how I'd taken no notice of even the  _  things like remembering phone numbers. We all should take some time to think about how we can depend  _  on our cell phones.",
