    "article": "Personally I think trains are exciting and romantic. I must  _  that trains are not important means of transportation in the US, but I do have some  _  with them.\nWhen I was a child, growing up in a small town with very little  _  , we used to go to the station to watch the passenger trains coming in. There was something  _  about the steaming, roaring string of cars coming into view around the mountains, slowly growing larger and  _  and finally  _  crowds of strangers onto the platform.\nI took my  _  train trip when I was ten years old. I went with my elder sister to visit our cousins six hundred miles away. The train--so loud and violent on the outside--was  _  and rocking inside. We were very excited, and as that was also our first time away from our parents, we felt somewhat frightened too. However, because I had  _  so much, I was a little disappointed when I was finally one of the passengers I had  _  for so long.\nAs a college student, I  used to  ride overnight train to my roommate's hometown. We could never afford a  _  , so we played cards, sang, ate, read and talked  _  we finally fell uncomfortably asleep in the straight-backed seats.\nMy idea that trains are  _  may come from the fact that my husband and I took the train on our honeymoon, spending extra money to eat in the dining car, and  looking out of  the window as the desert scenery slid past.\nNow, when I make a trip, I always fly or drive, and  _  are not a very important part of my life.  _  , every time I hear the train whistle faraway on a quiet night, I can always feel the  _  in my heart to pack my bags and jump on board, entering a  _  world of motions, sounds, sights, and experience which just aren't  _  in the dull environment of an airplane.",
