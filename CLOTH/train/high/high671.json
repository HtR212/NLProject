    "article": "I'm sitting at my mother's desk, a mahogany   one with rows of tiny drawers -- even a sliding secret compartment  . I've  _  it since I was just tall enough to see things  _  it as Mother sat doing letters. Standing by her chair, staring at the ink bottle, pens, and smooth white paper, I  _  that the act of writing must be the most  _  thing in the world.\nYears later, during her final illness, Mother  _  various items for my sister and brother. \"But the desk,\" she'd repeat, \"is for Elizabeth.\" I sensed Mother communicating with this gift, a communication I'd craved  for 50 years.\nMy mother was  brought up  in the Victorian belief that emotions were  _  . I never saw her angry, never saw her cry. I knew she loved me;she expressed it in  _  . But as a teenager I  longed for  heart-to-heart talks between mother and daughter. They never happened. And a gulf  opened between us.\nAs  _    passed and I raised my own family, I began to understand her. Forgive me, I wrote, for having been critical. In  _  words, I asked her to let me know in any way she chose that she did forgive me.\nI mailed the letter and waited  _  for her reply. None came. Eagerness turned to disappointment, then acceptance and, finally,  _  . I couldn't be sure that the letter had even got to mother. I only knew that I had written it. I could stop trying to make her into  _  she was not. For the last 15 years of her life we enjoyed a relationship on her   light, caring, cheerful.\nNow the  _  of her desk told me, as she'd never been able to, that she was pleased that  _  was my chosen work.\nThe desk stayed in our attic   for nearly a year before we turned a bedroom into a study.  _  at last I brought the desk down, it was dusty from months of storage.  _  , I polished the drawers. Pulling out the secret compartment, I found papers inside. And a one-page letter,   _   and  refolded many times.\nSend me a reply, my letter asks, in any way you choose. Mother, you  _  chose the act that speaks louder than words.",
