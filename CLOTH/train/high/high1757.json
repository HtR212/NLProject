For most of her life, she lived on a farm, where she brought up four children, and buried my grandpa.\nI visited her on weekends. After the gardening work, I was   _   to climb the mountain, singing songs and gathering flowers. Sometimes the plants scratched me. She would say, \"Beauty has a   _  . I hope it was worth it.\"\n\"Yes, ma' ma,\" I'd say. \"  _   was.\"\nI loved gathering flowers on my own. But what I loved best was gathering them with her. Even then, as a child, I knew what I wanted most from my grandma was not her flowers, but her   _  . She's been gone for years, but sometimes, when I   _  down to pick a flower or pull a weed, I see her   _  , not mine.\nI thought I'd grow up to be a gardener too. I told myself, someday my children had children, I'd be a gardening grandma. Then the grandbabies started showing up, and I discovered 1'd much rather run after them   _   go digging. Actually I'm no gardener. I'm a   _  , not a planter. I differ from my grandma in lots of ways, but this: I will always carry   _   me a heart she made from her own.\nI needn't plant a garden. My children are my flowers. They delight and complete me with a beauty that is worth any price. All I need to do is   _   them with time, water them with love, and hope that someday, when they hold their first grandchild, they might see my hand.",
