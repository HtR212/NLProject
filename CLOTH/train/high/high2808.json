    "article": "A single mother and her daughter living in my community are two of the most unfriendly people I have ever come across in my life. They are totally  _  , mixing with nobody. As they drive past neighbors they keep their eyes looking away and make no sign of  _  other people. The only fame they have is making a nuisance   of themselves to the local police station by  _  music played too loud, dogs barking more than once a day and any other little  _  .\nUpon moving into this neighborhood, I was  _  of these two but decided I would make up my own mind. This proved quite a  _  to me as more than once either the mother or the daughter would knock on my door and blast ( ) me with some  _  or other. I  _  answered politely and made sure I  _  as they went past my place and also made the effort now and then to make a kind  _  about their garden or pets.\nTime passed and in October, as part of the Kindness Rock Give, Maureen and I decided to place a kindness rock in their garden. Their  _  remained unchanged, however, and I continued to be as friendly as possible. During the Easter give, we decided once again to  _  these two unhappy ladies to our list and  _  a packet of cookies on their gate. Imagine my  _  when two days later they  _  at my gate and jokingly said they were  _  hanging their Christmas stocking on their gate, and they brought me a bunch of flowers!\nSo, my fellow gifters, do not give up on your random gifts of kindness. You may never  _  just what this  _  to others, nor how many broken or  _  hearted people you may just change  _  a simple act of kindness.",
