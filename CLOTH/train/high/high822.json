    "article": "The subject of what separates art and design has been debated for a long time. Artists and designers both create visual works using a/an  _  knowledge background, but their reasons for doing so are  _  different.

Perhaps the most fundamental difference that we can all agree on is their  _  . Typically, the process of creating a work of art starts with nothing, a blank sheet of paper. A  _  of art is born from a view or value that the artist holds within himself or herself. They create the art to share that feeling with others, to  _  \nthe viewers to relate to it, learn from it or be  _  by it. The most renowned and successful art today is something that establishes the strongest  _  connection between the artist and their\n  _  .\nBy contrast, when a designer sets out to  _  \n  _  starting point, whether a message, an image, an idea or an action. The designer's job isn't to invent something  _  , but to communicate something that already exists, for a purpose. That purpose is almost always to motivate the audience to do something: buy a product, use a\n  _  , visit a location, or learn certain information. The most  _  designs are those that most effectively  _  their message and motivate their consumers to carry out a task.",
