    "article": "Culture shock is the feeling of being confused a person may have when experiencing an unfamiliar way of life during a visit to or living in a new country. Culture shock can be described as consisting of at least one of the following    _  :\nHoneymoon, Negotiation  , Adjustment, and Mastery.  There is no true    _  to\nentirely avoid culture shock, as people in any society are personally  _  by cultural differences.\nDuring the honeymoon period, the   _  between the old and new culture are seen with a romantic\neye.  For example  , in moving to a new country, one might love\nthe new food, the pace of life, and the locals' habits.  _  ,\nlike most honeymoon periods, this stage  _  ends.\nAfter some time (usually around three months), here comes negotiation period where   differences between the old and new    _  become apparent and may\ncause  _  . Excitement may eventually  give way to  unpleasant\nfeelings of frustration   and anger. The most important change in the period is    _  : the language barrier may become a\nmajor problem  _  restoring   new relationships. \n  _   , after some time (usually 6 to 12 months), one grows    _  to the new culture and develops routines\n . One knows what to    _  in\nmost situations and the host country no longer feels all that  _  . One starts to develop problem-solving skills and begins to  _  the culture's ways with a positive attitude.\nIn the     _  stage,\none is able to participate   fully and comfortably in the host culture. Mastery does not mean    _  conversion\n ; a lot might be kept from their     _  culture, such as accents and\nlanguages.",
