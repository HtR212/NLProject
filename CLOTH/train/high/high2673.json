My disability has not made me   _   or admirable, or deserving a pat on the head   _   you can reach it. As a matter of fact, I   _  having my head patted.\nI have total feeling in all limbs , so when you said, \"You   _   didn't feel that\", rather than   _   for kicking me, you were wrong. I don't have   _   shoulders from pushing a wheelchair: my shoulders were born weak for that very reason.\nWaiting at bus stops, I'm a passive   _   for those who incorrectly assume my experience with the health care system and create a(n)   _   in your last doctor's appointment, or what   _   to the lady who lives down your street.\nIf given the   _  , I'm really good at putting people at ease. My communication with this able-bodied world depends on it. I can't   get by   without the help of others, but it works best for everyone if I can   _   when and how it is offered. If you are not sure whether you are going to offer to help, just ask, and don't be   _   if the answer is no.\nIf I make you feel uncomfortable, please   _   that you would manage to live as I do. There is no other choice. Please don't pass on your   _   to children by pushing them for staring, or wanting to touch and   _   my wheelchair.\nI'm sorry if I don't remember your name or the occasion we met -- there are more   _   adults in my life than wheelchair users in your life. And the answers to the questions are: my   _   chores  are done on my own; and yes I can, and I do, as often as opportunity   _  .",
