    "article": "Recently, we went on a vacation for a week that involved visiting four different ports in the sunny and warm climate of the Caribbean. There were  _  of laughter, fun and great food. It's a  _  thing when you go away that each day of the vacation also  count down  to the end and a return to work. It was twelve years since we went on a vacation, so this vacation was viewed with  _  of a great break away from my daily routine. And we weren't  _  . But there was something very different about this vacation compared to those when we worked in a corporative environment. The main  _  was that when we returned, when the vacation was rapidly drawing to a close, we didn't have the same feeling of  _  stress, anxiety and fear. In this recent vacation, it wasn't that we  _  enjoyed the various fun and new activities, the break away from routine, the pleasure of touring different countries and cultures, the  _  to do what we wanted when we wanted or the leisurely  _  of each day that was significant. What was significant was that we didn't  _  fear the last day of vacation. You see, we know that we were  returning to  what we love to do not what we had to do. The feelings experienced in the last couple of days of vacation were viewed with the same joy as the very first days. In the previous times, the last days of vacation were terrible. We experience an increasing  _  of stress  _  we knew that a return to our field of employment was \"work\" and not  _  that we loved and thoroughly enjoyed. The  _  is this: If you do what you love, it doesn't matter  in the least  that a vacation has to end. If you love what you do you will not  _  yourself wishing for even a few more days of vacation, or wishing that you could  _  enjoying this vacation for much, much longer. A love of what you do  _  you back like a magnet.",
