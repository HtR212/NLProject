    "article": "As a music teacher,I have always known that music touches the soul. It can  break through  all kinds of barriers to reach students in a very special way.It can be the  _  for each child to find their light.I would like to  _  a story about it. For a few years I was  _  with the opportunity to teach disabled students.One of my most  _  students was a five-year-old girl called Vanessa,who had difficulty walking,and could not speak.We  _  sat on the floor for our music lessons and Vanessa liked to  _  on my lap.One of her favorite songs was John the Rabbit.It was a call and response song where I sang the call and the students  _  twice while singing the repeating phrase,\"Oh,yes!\" Vanessa liked to  _  her hands together with mine and clap with me.We probably performed that song during every class,Vanessa and I clapping together.But she  _  said or sang a word. One day,when the song was finished,Vanessa turned around,  _  me in the eyes,clapped her tiny hands twice and said the words\"Oh,yes!\" I opened my mouth in  _  and for that moment I was the one who could not speak.When my heart  _  started beating again,I looked over at the assistant teacher to find her also  _  .Through music,we had made an awesome connection. Several years later,I met Vanessa on the street in town.She waved with a big  _  on her face and then clapped her hands twice,imitating the song we had  _  so many times in our music class.The little girl,  _  her connection with music,left an impression on me that will last forever. Every child has the  _  to learn and grow. It is up to us to  _  the way to reach each and every one of our students.We all must find each child's  _  .",
