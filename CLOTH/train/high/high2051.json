    "article": "During my second year of college, I was a part-time waitress in Chicago. I  _   most of my time on work and as little as possible on conversation. I wasn't used to  _   to unknown people except when taking orders.\nOne night, a little old man came in and seated himself in my section. I took his   _  and went on my way. But later I noticed that he   came in   week after week and always sat at one of my tables. Slowly, I began having short conversations   _   him. His name was Mr. Rodgers, but he insisted that I   _  him Don. I   _   that he and his wife had gone to dinner and a movie every Saturday. Since she had died, he carried on the tradition  _   .\n  _  the weeks went on, I began to sit and actually talk with Don. We talked about his wife, his days flying in the war, his son who had   grown up   and also served as a pilot in the army. Eventually, we began to talk about my ambition -- going to school, my new boyfriend and the   _  of my future. \nAbout four months after meeting him, I   _   a call from a nurse telling me that Don was48 in hospital  . He was experiencing complications   from a heart operation. I immediately drove to the hospital to see him. The first thing he did was to  _   me for urging him to visit the doctor. At first I didn't know   _   he was referring to. Then I  _   that about three weeks earlier,Don was complaining   about   _   pains and I gave him the number of a doctor I know.\nA nurse asked, \"Are you his daughter?\" and I   _  , \"No, I'm his waitress.\"\nStrangers can become good   _   . I recently found it enjoyable to talk to   _   at the restaurant and I have had a lot more fun.",
