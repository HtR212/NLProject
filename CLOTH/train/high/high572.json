    "article": "I became a gardener when I was twelve. My early  _  of gardening may not have originated from my love for nature. It was to  _  my parents. At that time, we had a big yard in which a beautiful maple tree stood. But my mother often looked with  _  at this work of natural art. Those golden leaves seemed like tons of rubbish to her, \"something else to  clean up  !\"Seeing the neighbors busy with gardening, my father even thought it a waste of time. At that age, I always did something  _  to whatever my parents did!If gardening were something they found  _  , I would plant a garden! I planted some lily seeds in the yard. But they failed to  come up  . I continued to plant sunflower seeds and roses. Wild  _  joy, I found the first rose bloom . One by one, the flowers bloomed their heads off.  _  , I was touched by this land of wonder.  _  , my parents showed no interest in my garden. My father even  _  at me because he found it was  _  to move around my garden to the driveway. To my mother's  _  , I put in her vase my real roses which, in her eyes, were simply weeds  rather than  flowers. Regardless of their  _  , I kept on planting my garden and  _  to enjoy the pleasure of gardening. Plants make such good companions: they breathe, they bloom, they  _  to care and love. It has been many years since I made my first garden out of my desire to  _  my parents. Today I become known as Mrs. Greenthumbs, teaching gardening and hosting a gardening show, which makes my parents feel very  _  . And now I could say it is my affection for  _  that makes me a real gardener.",
