    "article": "An acrobatic master performed a tightrope walk between two mountains, which attracted thousands of people. When the  _  started, he went to one end of the tightrope,  _  straight at the goal ahead, with open arms, walking slowly step by step to the opposite side of the mountain. Immediately, the audience  broke into  loud applause. \"If my hands dare tied, do you believe I can  go across  ?\" he asked the audience.  _  , some people didn't believe, but in order to know the  _  , they said, \"We believe you!\" Then, he had his hands tied with a rope and walked past  _  . He looked around and said, \"If I'm blindfolded with my hands tied, do you  _  believe I can go past?\" This time, the people said without  _  , \"We believe you!\" In this way, his eyes were  _  with a black cloth. He moved slowly to the tightrope and walked along it inch by inch. This time, he went past once again. The audience burst into  _  . Then, he  _  a child and asked all the people, \"If I put him on my shoulders  _  I'm blindfolded with my hands tied as well, do you still believe I can make it?\" All the people replied before  _  , \"We believe you!\" \"I ask you again. Do you really believe me?\" \"Yes, we believe you completely!\" Then, he said, \"Well then, since you believe me,  _  my child with yours. Who will?\" All of a sudden, the audience fell  _  . The silence lasted for nearly ten minutes. After ten minutes, the acrobatic master said nothing, just put the child on his shoulders and walked past along the tightrope. Sure enough, this time he  _  once more. Faced with things far from their own  _  , people can often make judgments easily and quickly, but once involved in it, most of people \"cannot  _  it clearly\". Only those who are really confident, like the master in the tightrope walk, can stay  _  at any time.",
