But a month later, I was invited to a party and there I  _  an elderly couple. The wife and I  _  for a long time. She told me how  _  she was about her husband who was  waiting for  a heart operation. At that time I was working as a researcher in the same  _  where the husband would be going for his operation,  _  I told her to set down my phone number and  _  me to let me know when he was there. She phoned a few weeks later as  _  and told me that her husband was admitted to the hospital and  _  waiting. I told her that I would go and cheek on him every day when I was at  _  . I thought that if it was my dad, I would do the same, so I was determined to keep  _  with them. Weeks turned into months and it just became my  _  to see them and keep track of how things were going before, during and after the heart operation. Sometimes I'd bring a  _  for him to read, or some food that we would  _  together. As time went by, it seemed like I became part of the  _  . Even after the husband returned from the hospital, we still often  _  each other on holidays. Now, ten years later, I have my own  _  . Since our parents don't  _  close by, this couple has become my son's \"local\" grandparents. My wife and I often feel truly  _  to have this couple as our \"local\" parents! Sometimes family comes out of the most unexpected place.",
