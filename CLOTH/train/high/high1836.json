He had studied to be a marine   biologist,but couldn't get a  _  job in that field here. \"I like driving a taxi now,\" he said. \"  _  I have hoped to do better than just  getting by  .\"Like many people, Tony thought that being self-reliant   meant  _  asking for help. But we need to nurture   relationships in order to  _  our goals.\nTony liked to chat with his  _  but he didn't want to bother    them. I advised him to give it a  _  . And he did. Not only did his customers take his taxi more often, but they  _  him to their friends. Soon he had a long list of regulars and  was able to  buy his own car, then a second. He had to  _  a friend to help with the overflow.\nEach of us contains  _  of greatness, which can be expressed in  _  ways, from starting a business to  _  the next generation of leaders.

My dad would come home, his hands hurt and  _  , and said, \"I don't want this for you, Keith. You need a great  _  .\"\nAlthough my father didn't know the CEO of his company, he wasn't afraid to introduce himself and ask for his advice. The CEO liked his  _  and helped me get a scholarship at one of the best schools in the country. I went on to Yale University and Harvard Business School. Soon I was the youngest chief marketing officer in the Fortune 500. I learned at a young age that the secret to success  lies in  the power of relationships.",
