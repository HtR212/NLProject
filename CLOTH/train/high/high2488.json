    "article": "I do a lot of management training each year for my company, a national chain of convenience stores. Among the topics we deal with in our seminars  is how to   _   quality employees. This is a real challenge for managers,   _   the low pay in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask managers: \"What caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\" A new manager named Susan answered the question: \"It was a $19 baseball   _  .\"\nSusan told the group that she had originally taken her job as an interim position   _  she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she   _  a phone call from her 9-year-old son, Jesse. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very   _  , and her first check had to be used to pay bills. \n   When she arrived at work the next morning, the store manager asked her to a small room in back of the store that   _  as an office. Susan wondered if she had done something wrong. She was   _   and confused.   _  , the manager handed her a box. \"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\" she said. \"And I know it's   _  to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jesse. He needs to understand how important he is,   even though  you have to pay your bills. You know we   _   pay good people like you as much as we would like to, but we do   _  , and I want you to know that you are   _   to us. \"\n  The thoughtfulness and   _  of this store manager shows that people remember how much employers care more than how much they pay. That was an important lesson, for only the cost of a baseball glove.",
