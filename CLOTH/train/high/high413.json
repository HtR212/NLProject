Before setting out, I told Barrett this trip would be tiring and  _  . For the first two days, he said almost nothing. I worried the trip was too  _  for a 17-year-old. Then, on day three, as we were  _  over high rocky mountains, he turned to me and grinned ,\"Pretty hard.\" After that there was no turning back. A five-year-old girl, wearing a dress several sizes  _  large and broken shoes, followed Barrett around, mesmerized . He couldn't stop  _  . Later he said  _  , \"I wish I could speak French.\" I was  _  -- this from a boy who hated and  fought against  French classes throughout school. Usually silent, he  _  Gaby, our host, and kept asking questions about the country and its people. He blossomed .  _  , the moment that really took  _  breath away occurred in a village deep in the mountains. I was  _  a woman villager for an article. 135 centimeters tall, she was small in figure but strong in  _  .
