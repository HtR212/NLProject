    "article": "Chris's parents were proud of him when he graduated from college. But it's been six months and he hasn't gotten a(n)  _  yet. In fact, he hasn't looked for it  _  . He has no idea what he wants to do and he's always thinking of his old grad school .\nHe's  _  at home with his parents and their relationship are getting tense, especially with his father, who  _  Chris for being lazy and afraid to  _  the real world.\nChris thinks his dad is being totally  _  , after all, he's only young once and he needs some \"space\". During a recent  _  , Chris said, \"I'm not you, Dad. I have my own way of doing things. I want a job I  _  .\" His dad replied, \"That's a nice  _  , but in the end they call it \"work\" because it's about making a productive living--not having fun.\"\nThere are many youngsters like Chris who are having trouble getting  _  with a serious job and becoming self-reliant. Some, like Peter Pan, just don't want to grow up. Some are afraid of  _  a wrong decision or of being rejected. Others are  _  of what psychologists call \"magical thinking.\" They believe that when the time is right, everything will fall into place, so they  wait for  good chance to come knocking or until they feel encouraged to take their next step.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't  _  that way. What's important is to begin. Things happen and opportunities  _  most often when we're moving, not standing  _  . The ability to keep developing or being more  _  is very important. Basic physics says it's easier to  _  the course of a moving object than to start movement at the beginning. In the end, it's not really about finding yourself,  _  it's about making yourself.\nThe first steps are the   _  , but the key to success in anything is getting started.",
