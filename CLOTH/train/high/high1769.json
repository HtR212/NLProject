    "article": "Outside our hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, a seemingly ancient woman waited beside the door with her hand outstretched . Every day I put my hand in hers as our eyes  _  . She never  _  to return my smile, my grasp, and my greeting. On the last day of our  _  , I found myself  _  on a busy corner across the street from our hotel. Bicycles and motorbikes rushed in front of me. We had been advised to walk  _  through the heavy traffic without looking right or left. Let them  _  us. But tonight I was by myself and felt  _  to face the stream of vehicles.  _  I hesitated on the sidewalk, I felt a hand on my elbow and looked down to see the smile of my small beggar friend looking up at me. She nodded her head toward the street,  _  that she would take me across. Together, we moved slowly into the chaos. Then we moved on  _  the sidewalk, where she pulled my face down to hers, kissed me on both cheeks, and then walked away, still smiling and waving back to me. I had not given her a single coin. We had  _  something vastly more important--a warming of hearts in friendship. Traveling in poorer nations, I have  _  a variety of ways to deal with beggars. The most  _  response of tourists faced with those extremely poor people is to  _  them and focus their eyes elsewhere. I have seen people push away an outstretched hand in  _  . A few may hurriedly drop a few coins, and then make a quick getaway in hopes that another 20 ragged beggars won't immediately appear on the  _  . For many reasons, giving money is not the best  _  to an outstretched hand. The greatest gift is time and respect. To look beggars in the eye and smile, thus acknowledging their existence, is a small thing. Putting your hand into another's outstretched hand and grasping it  _  for a moment is also a small thing. But these are important. Everyone needs  _  , to be seen as worthy of being  _  , to feel appreciated and loved. And I believe that everyone is worthy and worth knowing.",
