Money was tight, and he became even more  _  when on Christmas Eve, he saw  _   the child had pasted the gold paper so as to decorate a shoebox to put under the Christmas tree.\n  _  , the next morning the little girl, filled with excitement, brought the gift box to her   _   and said, \"This is for you, Daddy!\" As he opened the box, the father was   _   by his earlier overreaction.  _  when he opened it, he found it was  _   and again his anger flared. \"Don't you know, young lady,\" he said harshly, \"  _   you give someone a   _   there's supposed to be something inside the package!\"The little girl looked  _   at him with tears rolling from her eyes and said: \"Daddy, it's not empty. I blew kisses into it until it was all full.\" The father was   _  . He fell on his knees and put his arms around his precious little girl. He begged her to  _   him for his unnecessary anger.\nAn accident took the  _   of the child only a short time later.   _  is told that the father kept that little gold box by his bed for all the years of his life.   _   he was discouraged or faced difficult problems he would open the box, take   _   an imaginary kiss, and remember the love of this beautiful child   _   had put it there.\nIn a very real sense, each of us as human beings have been given an  _  golden box filled   _   unconditional love and kisses from our children, family, friends and God. There is no more  _  possession anyone could hold.",
