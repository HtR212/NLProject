One day he asked God, \"They tell me you are  _  me to the earth tomorrow but how am I going to live there being so  _  and helpless?\"\nGod replied, \"Among many angels , I  _  one for you. She will be waiting for you and will  take care of  you. What's more, your angel will sing for you and will also smile for you every day. And you will feel your angel's love and be  _  .But here in heaven,I do nothing else but sing and smile!That's enough for me.\"\n\"And how am I going to be able to  _  when people talk to me?\"the child  _  .\"I don't know the language.\"\nGod answered gently,\"Your angel will tell you the most beautiful and sweet  _  , and with much patience and care, your angel will teach you how to  _  .\"\n\"I've heard that on the earth there are bad men, Who will  _  me?\"\n\"Your angel will shelter you even if it  _  risking  her life!\"\n\"But I will always be sad because I will not  _  you any more,\"the child continued. God smiled at him.\"Your angel will always talk to you about me and will teach you the  _  for you to come back to me, and as a matter of fact I will  _  be next to you.\"\nAt that moment it was  _  in Heaven, but voices from the  _  could be heard. The child  _  he had to start on his journey very soon. He asked God one more question softly,\"Oh God, if I am about to  _  now, please tell me my angel's  _  .\"\nGod touched the child on the shoulder and answered,\"It's easy to remember. You will simply call her  _  .\"",
