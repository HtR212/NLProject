    "article": "Last year , I lost my best friend in high school . It seemed that everyone else's life could just continue on in its  _  way, but mine couldn't . I wasn't sure how I was going to be able to face  _  and their gossip at school . I was forced to  deal with  my routine on Monday morning as usual. In the evening I returned home from school  _  completely defeated . All I wanted to do was  _  into bed and wallow in my own self-pity. I pulled back the covers on my bed and  _  (n)  _  that is was to be opened on a  _  night that week. I made it through that week  because of  my father . Each card  _  to say just what I needed to hear.Tuesday's card said , \"The past is painful to think about and the  _  is impossible to imagine.Don't try.Just take it one minute at a time.\"On Wednesday my mood  _  when I read. \"What you are feeling now is  _  and normal.It still feels very bad , but it is part of the healing  _  .\"Friday's card contained a poem he wrote.The last lines made me smile through my tears. \"Whatever special  _  you face along life's way,may you  _  that you will find the best in every day.\"I was instructed to open the last card  _  the party I went to on Saturday night . In it he wisely reminded me to  _  . \"The world isn't so bad after a good laugh.The more you laugh.the more you heal.\"Each card was signed , \"Love , Dad.\" My world once collapsed but I  got through  the difficult breakup eventually. It owed to my dad, who made his  _  known when he couldn't be present",
