    "article": "It was one of the hottest days of the dry season. We had not seen rain in almost a month. The crops were  _  . Every day, my husband and his brothers would go about the hard  _  of  trying to get water to the fields. If we didn't see some rain soon, we would lose everything.\nIt was on this day that I learned the true lesson of sharing and  _  a miracle . I was in the kitchen making lunch when I saw my six-year old son, Billy, walking toward the woods. He wasn't walking as usual, but with a serious purpose. He was obviously walking with great effort, trying to be as  _  as possible. Minutes after he disappeared into the  _  , he came running out again, toward the house.\nMoments later he was once again walking in those slow purposeful steps towards the woods. He kept doing this for about an hour. Finally I decided to  _  him on his journey.\nHe was cupping  both hands in front of him as he walked, being very  _  not to spill the water he held in them. Then I saw a tiny deer lying on the ground,  _  suffering from dehydration , lift its head with great effort to lap up  the water cupped in my boy's hands.\nWhen the water was  _  , Billy jumped up to ran back to the house. I was there in front of him. His eyes just filled with  _  . \"I'm not wasting water\" was all he said and I hugged him tightly.\nAs the tears that  rolled down  my face began to hit the ground, they were suddenly joined by other drops... more drops... and more. I looked up at the sky. It was raining!\nSome will probably say that this was nothing but a huge  _  . All I can say is that the rain that came that day saved our farm, just like the actions of one little boy saved another.",
