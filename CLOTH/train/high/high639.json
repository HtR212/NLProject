The lecturer speaks for one or two hours, perhaps  _  the talk with slides, writing down important information on the blackboard,  handing out  reading material and giving out  _  . The new student sees the other students continuously writing on notebooks and  1  _  what to write. Very often the student leaves the lecture  _  notes which do not catch the main points and  _  become hard even for the  _  to understand. Most institutions provide courses which  _  new students to develop the skills they need to be  _  listeners and note-takers.  _  these are unavailable, there are many useful study-skills guides which  _  learners to practice these skills  _  . In all cases it is important to  _  the problem before actually starting your studies.\nIt is important to  _  that most students have  _  in acquiring the language skills  _  in college study. One way of  _  these difficulties is to attend the language and study-skills classes which most institutions provide throughout the  _  year. Another basic  _  is to find a study partner with whom it is possible to identify difficulties,  _  ideas and provide support.",
