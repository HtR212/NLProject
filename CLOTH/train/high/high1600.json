    "article": "When I was in junior high school, what my friends thought of me was really important to me. During those years, I grew much  _  than most of my peers . Being so tall made me feel  _  . In order to keep the focus off my unusual  _  , I went along with the crowd who would  play tricks on  other kids at school. It made sure that the tricks were  _  at others, and not at me. Once before a  _  class, my friends and I pulled a  _  trick on one of the kids on the basketball team, which made him terribly embarrassed. I thought it was going to be funny,  _  it all ended up that no one thought it was. My parents didn't always think that my  _  was funny. They reminded me about \"The Golden Rule\": to  _  others as I would like to be treated. What I was doing was  _  other kids, and in turn hurting my  _  as someone to be looked up to. My friends were looking up to me  _  I was tall, but what did they see? My parents wanted me to be a leader who set a good  _  to others. They taught me to set my own goals, and to do the  _  at everything that I set out to do. They told me to be the leader that I was  _  to be-to be a big man in my heart and actions, as well as in my body. I had to  _  myself whether or not I would be the kind of leader and person my parents  _  I was inside, but I knew in my heart that they were  _  . \"Be a leader, Shaquille, not a(n)  _  . Since people already have to look up to you, give them a good reason to do so.\"",
