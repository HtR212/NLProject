When her grandfather Tom Turner bought the land 15 years earlier, he stocked the pond with fishes.  _   in winter, Tom   _   regularly visit the 5.5-acre pond to feed the fishes. One afternoon,   _   the sun melted toward the horizon, Tom   turned back   to head home from the pond.   All of a sudden  , he was unable to put one foot in front of the other and then   _   backward into the pond's deep water. When he didn't   _  immediately, Cara jumped in. It was too deep to touch the   _  . With one hand, Cara grabbed the bank. With the other, she   _   for her grandfather.\nTom had   _   a stroke the year before. Now Cara wondered if he had   _  again. She grabbed her grandfather's head, pulled his face out of the water and then pulled him up onto the solid ground. The winter sun almost disappeared, and they were both shaking   _   the coldness. Cara knew she would have to get Tom to   the car  first, a quarter mile away. But sixty feet from the car, Tom fell. From there, he crawled ,   _   himself under a gate, to the car. Caro helped him into the passenger's side and then got into the driver's seat. \"I used to sit on my dad's lap and watch him  _  ,\" said Cara. Although she felt   _  , she pushed on the gas and drove toward the nearest hospital   _  her grandmother Esca was to meet them.\nTom spent six days   _   in the hospital from a stroke. Since the accident, he has   _  going to the pond alone. \"If Cara hadn't helped, she might not have a grandpa   any more  ,\" said Esca.",
