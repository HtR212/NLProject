What she saw shocked her: Her son Tommy was standing from his armchair, pointing to a cute little dog and   _   excitedly. \nIf you knew the 3-year-old boy couldn't walk or speak   _   that, you would not wonder why Mrs. Smith was so shocked at the   _   of his son's behavior. Actually, Tommy is a very   _   boy, with golden hair and big blue eyes, but when you talk with him you may find there is something wrong with him: He   _   to make eye contact with you or to respond to you; instead, he murmurs to   _   about something nobody can understand ----- he lives in a word of his own. \nMrs. Smith found that was a dog next door. He surely   _   the boy. He ran to him and sat before him, his body   _   and his tail wagging. The boy reached his hand to touch the dog's face while the dog licked the boy's hand with his   _  . Then they began to \"talk\", \"laugh\", and \"walking\" on   _   legs around the yard. \nSeeing this, tears of   _   filled Mrs. Smith's eyes. Three years before, her husband had   _   her and her son because of her son's illness, and ever since her son had been the   _   of her life. She had taken her son to many experts but with    no   effect. \nFrom then on, the little dog became their   _   visitor and Tommy   _   stepped out of his own world and turned normal boy. \nAnimals have been   _   of mankind for thousands of years. Man has turned more cunning and less reliable as he has become more   _  , while animals remain pure and innocent,   so   that he feels more comfortable with them than with his fellow creature.",
