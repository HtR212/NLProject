    "article": "My mother and I started our morning by rushing into the local grocery store. I waited in line at the Starbucks counter while she  _  around to pick up a few things. As I was  _  there I noticed an elderly woman, wearing layers  _  layers of old torn clothing, moving behind me in line. She had a few toiletries and seemed to want the Starbucks cashier to  ring up  since our queue was shorter than the grocery store queues were. At some point I became  _  of her moving closer behind me -it was  _  than I was comfortable with! I instinctively  _  a hand over my purse and drew it closer to me. My fear and imagination raced creating wild  _  about this homeless woman who might try to  _  from me. Then it was my  _  to order. As the cashier rang up my total I discovered I was 37 cents  _  . I called to my mother but she is hard of hearing. She asked me to  _  what I said but she still couldn't  _  me out. At that point, a long grey arm, with  _  in its sleeves,  _  over from behind me. She laid 37 cents out on the counter, saying, \"Here, We all need some  _  sometimes.\" I was  _  ! Here was a woman who clearly had very little to  _  and in great need herself. I had judged her  _  and she had reached out, voluntarily, to help me! What an amazing gift and lesson this woman gave me about  _  others. Thank You, God!!",
