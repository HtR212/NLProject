    "article": "Embroidering When I was a little boy living in New York, my mother used to embroider a great deal. I would sit at her knee and look up from the  _  and ask what she was doing. She  _  me that she was embroidering. I told her that it looked like a mess from where I was. As from the underside I watched her work within the  _  of the little round hoop that she held in her hand, I complained to her that it sure looked  _  from where I sat. She would smile at me, look down and  _  say, \"My son, you go about your  _  for a while, and when I am finished with my embroidering, I will put you on my  _  and let you see it from my side.\" I would wonder why she was using some dark threads along with the  _  ones and why they seemed so jumbled from my  _  . A few minutes would pass and then I would hear Mother's voice say, \" Son, come and sit on my knee.\" This I did only to be surprised and  _  to see a beautiful flower or a sunset. I could not  _  it, because from underneath it looked so messy. Then mother would  _  to me, \"My son, from underneath it did look messy and jumbled, but you did not realize that there was a  _  plan on the top. It was a  _  . I was only following it. Now look at it from my side  _  you will see what I was doing.\" Many  _  through the years, I have  _  up to my Heavenly Father and said, \" Father, what are You doing? \" He  _  , \" I am embroidering your  _  . \"I say, \" But it looks like a mess to me. It seems so jumbled. The threads seem so dark. Why can't they all be bright ? \" The Father seems to tell me, \" My child, you go about your business of doing My business, and one day I will bring you to  _  and put you on my knee and you will see the plan from My side. \"",
