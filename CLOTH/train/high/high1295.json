    "article": "Theree times a week we have to drive to physical therapy for my husband's hand that was reattached two months ago after a borrible work accident.\n    Today we  _  thirty\nminutes late but just a few miles into the trip we saw a young man struggled\nagainst the  _  winds that were almost pushing our car\noff the road. We stopped and asked if he needed a  _  .He\naccepted in no time and  _  jumped into the back seat. His\nname was Dan and he wasn't going far.\n    As we dropped him off, we  _  he\nhad many large piles of cut wood stacked in his yard so we  _  if\nhe was interested in selling any. He said, \"Oh, you can just come by anytime,\neven if I'm not here and  _  up all you want.\"We asked\nhow much it would cost for a trunkload. He replied, \"It's  _  ,take\nall you want. We have more than we'll use and we're  _  at\nhome so just drop by anytime and get it. Thanks for your help and have a great\nday!\"\n    We kept  _  we'd pay\nfor it and would only get it if someone was home, but he just kept repeating  _  he'd already told us. Then as his  _  pit\nbull dog came and gave me a   _  on\nthe hand, Dan said, \"Come on, boy!\"They both  took off  racing to\nthe doorway and Dan yelled one last time,\"Thanks again!\"\nWhat  _  me most about his\noffer is that he was in the back seat and didn't saw my husband's hand. One of\nhis fingers is  _  now and they are patched up with the two\nskin grafts , meaning it doesn't have the  _  it\nused to. Dan just  _  us with the wood, never knowing  how much  that would mean to us now when my husband isn't able to  _  any for us this winter.",
