    "article": "I went to my favorite restaurant one evening to have supper. I knew the owner very well.  _  I was waiting for the soup to arrive, I looked around to see if I knew anyone in the restaurant. It was  _  that I noticed a man sitting at the corner table  _  watching in my direction, as if he knew me. The man had a newspaper open  in front of  him, which he was  _  to read, though all the while I could see that he was keeping an eye on me. When the waiter brought the soup, the man was clearly  _  by the familiar way in which the waiter and I talked to each other. He became even more puzzled as time went on and it grew more and more obvious that I was well  _  in the restaurant. In the end he got up and went to the kitchen. After a few minutes he came  _  again, paid his bill and left without  _  looking in my direction. When I finished and was  _  to pay my bill, I called the owner over and  _  him what the man had wanted. The owner at  _  didn't want to tell me. I  _  \" Well\", he said \" that man was a detective.\"  _  ?\" I said, much surprised. \" he followed you here because he  _  you were the man he was looking for,\" the owner said. \" He showed me a photo of the  _  man. He certainly looked  _  you! Of course since we know you here. I was able to make him  _  that he had made a mistake.\" \" It's  _  I came to a restaurant where I'm where I'm known,\" I said, \" otherwise I  _  have been taken to police station!\"",
