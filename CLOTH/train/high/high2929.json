He was obsessed with this desire --- he ate, slept, and walked with one and only dream: to die, having accomplished every single thing he was able to accomplish. There were so many things he could do. He felt like the whole world could be his,  _  he set his mind to it. He knew that his  _  had no limits. He knew that he could accumulate  _  that would dwarf that of ancient kings; he knew that he could  _  books that would shake the minds of generations; he knew that he could  _  things that would forever change the lives of millions of people. He lived, constantly feeling the power within --- and that power knew no bounds. There was only one problem: having such a potential, but only one  _  , he had to make a choice. He had to decide where to  _  all of his ability. Making that decision was extremely hard, for any  _  meant cutting off some future achievements. In the meantime, he went to school, graduated, found a job, married, and  _  children. And he spent every minute of his spare time trying to decide  _  he should bring his potential into full play. Time went by, and he grew  _  . Some roads he used to dream about became closed to him. But there was still so much he could accomplish. One day, a sudden chest pain made him come home early. He dragged his feet to the bathroom. There, feeling  _  , he looked in the mirror. A worn-out, gray-haired man stared back at him. He looked  _  into these eyes and, all of a sudden,  _  one simple truth. The next moment, the pain came again, and his heart stopped  _  forever. The truth that came upon him was rather simple: People only flatter themselves (,) by thinking that they could have  _  this or that if not for such-and-such circumstances. Yet this is nothing but  _  . You simply lack something that is  _  for achieving that goal you've never reached -- a talent, a skill, willpower,  _  something else. In fact,  _  you don't achieve is something you're not capable of achieving.",
