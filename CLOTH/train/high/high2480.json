    "article": "At just 18 years old, Canberra student Lochie Ferrier has already conducted research in a frontier field -- aerospace engineering. Aerospace engineering is the primary    _    of engineering concerned with the science and technology of aircraft and spacecraft.\nIn 2014, he was one of 80 high school students worldwide who 37 participated in  a six-week science and engineering program at MIT. During the program, he was    _   by the institute's scientists, and developed a method to identify inactive satellites. This method, called OASIS, is designed  39 _   a way to help manage space debris , which    _    operating satellites.   \n\"One solution to this problem is a    _    robot that can gather pieces of space debris and store them in orbit,\" he says. \"These pieces could be    _    to new satellites later, thus    _    the costs and launch weights of new satellites.\" However,    _   satellite identification technology would be needed for this solution, and that's what Lochie is working on. \"I hope this method would be put into practice in the near future, 45 _  in the next 10 years,\" he says.\nLochie has made the   _   of the Young Innovators category of the Australian Innovation Challenge Awards with his OASIS. This category is open to students aged 21 years or  _    and carries a $ 5,000 prize. If he won, he would use the money to help fund    _     research into OASIS. \"My plan for using the money would be to try to use materials which could stand up to the   _   environment of space,\" he says.\nHe is also considering how to   _   the technology to organizations such as NASA and satellite manufacturers.\nLochie's  51 _   in aerospace engineering was aroused by the big dish antenna at NASA's tracking station near Canberra,which he visited in his early teens. He said his software design and development teacher at Canberra Grammar School    _    him, too.   \"He taught me valuable project management and skills which I applied to OASIS.\"\nLochie has been attending Canberra Grammar School and will soon    _   exams for admission to universities. He    _    his time between schoolwork, his personal    _    projects such as OASIS and the development of apps, rock climbing, and playing classical violin. The teenager is well on his way to realizing his sky-high ambition.",
