    "article": "There was a store a half hour' s walk from my apartment, and it was the cheapest place to buy food for us students studying abroad in France,  _  there was always a long checkout line. On a cold March day, I spent my time shopping, got what I needed and  headed for  the checkout.  As usual  , the lines that day were long. There were people everywhere. I was standing  _  in line because I just wasn't that  confident about  my French yet. Any time that I had to  _  with the natives, I got a little nervous. When my  _  came, I began to put my things on the cashier desk, hoping that the cashier wouldn't  speak to  me. With nervous energy, I was shaking back and forth, but I didn't even notice I was continually  setting off  a security alarm! The entire store was watching me now. To my  _  , the store manager came to me a few moments later. She started to  _  me in French. Then she realized that I spoke no French. The next five minutes were spent  _  me: my backpack, my coat pockets, my jean pockets. And there were hands  _  . Everyone was looking, pointing, and  _  . I stood embarrassedly all the while; the  _  was still ringing out. Then I  _  this had happened to me before in the States. New  _  always equal alarms. The clothes contain small sensors that you are supposed to  _  before wearing. So I grabbed my shirt and turned it  _  . There was a \"Remove Before Washing\" tag in it.  _  I could say anything, the manager brought a pair of scissors and then cut off the tag. I packed up my backpack, and marched out of the store with a strange mixture of embarrassment and pride.",
