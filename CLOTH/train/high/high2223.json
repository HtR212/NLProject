Animals, spiders, insects...\nOne day   _   walking through the woods the nice old man found a cocoon   of a butterfly. He   _  it home.\nA few days later, a small   _  appeared; he sat and watched the butterfly for several hours   _  it struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it seemed to   _  making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could and it could go  _   farther.\nThen the man decided to help the   _   , so he took a pair of scissors and   cut open  the remaining bit of the cocoon.\nThe butterfly then came out   _  .\n  _  it had a swollen   body and small, shriveled   wings. The man   _   to watch the butterfly because he expected that, at any moment, the wings would   _   to be able to support the body, which would contract in time. Neither happened!   In fact   , the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling   around with a swollen body and shriveled wings.\nIt never able to   _   .\nWhat the man in his kindness and haste did not understand was that the restricting     _  and the struggle required for the butterfly to   get through   the tiny opening were Nature's way of forcing fluid   from the body of the butterfly into its wings so that it would be ready for flight once it achieved its  _   from the cocoon.\nSometimes   _   are exactly what we need in our life. If we were allowed to go through our life without any challenges, it would weaken us. We would not be as   _  as what we could have been.\nAnd we could never fly.",
