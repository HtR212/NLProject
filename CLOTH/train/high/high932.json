    "article": "As I was leaving the grocery store yesterday, I noticed an old man struggling with two bags of food. I pulled up close to him and rolled the car window down to ask  _  he needed a lift. I think he was a bit skeptical  , but he did  _  .\nAfter he got settled in the car, my husband and I  _  ourselves, but he was not willing to give his name. During the drive, we tried to make him more  _  with small talk. We  _  about the weather, the newly-opened store, and the like. His home was more than two miles away down that same road, so it would have been a (an)  _  walk for anyone, let alone an old man carrying  _  .\nWhen we pulled up outside his door, the first thing he  _  was, \"How much money do you want?\" My husband and I  _  answered, \"Nothing, we just wanted to help.\" The relief on the man's face was actually  _  , because we should be able to live in a world where it isn't shocking to have someone help you out of the goodness of their heart, without expecting something in  _  . After realizing we truly didn't  _  anything, he kept thanking us over and over.\nMy only  _  to him were, \"Sir, I hope this has helped you out. Have a good week.\" These simple acts of kindness, just  _  him walking and then doing something about it, are the  _  of kindness that anyone can do. It doesn't  _  a cent. Just be aware of the world happening around you. There is  _  someone who needs something -- a door held open, a bag carried... The  _  are endless. And I truly hope this may be the  _  of this man practicing acts of kindness -- just  _  it happened to him. Oh, and the best part was my excitement, happiness and peace, just knowing that I helped a fellow human being.",
