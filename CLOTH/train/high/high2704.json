    "article": "A thousand years ago Hong Kong was covered by a thick forest like the forests we now find in Malaysia and Thailand. As more and more  _  came to live in Hong Kong, these trees were cut down and burnt. Now there is no forest left,  _  there are still some areas covered with trees. We call these  _  . Elephants, tigers, monkeys and many other animals used to live in the  _  forests of Hong Kong, and there were even crocodiles in the  _  and along the coast. When people came to live in Hong Kong, the animals began to  _  out. Early farmers grew rice and kept pigs and chickens in the valleys. They  cut down  the trees and burnt them. They needed fires to keep themselves  _  in the winter, to cook their food, and to keep away from dangerous animals. Elephants quickly disappeared because there was not enough  _  for them. So did most of the wolves, and tigers. Monkeys, squirrels and many other animals soon died out in the same  _  . You might think that there are  no longer  any animals in Hong Kong, except in the  _  . You might think there can't be any wild animals in such a  _  place with so many cars and buildings. But there is  still  a good deal of countryside in Hong Kong and New Territories, and there are still about thirty-six different kinds of animals living there. One of the most interesting of Hong Kong's  _  is the barking deer. They are beautiful little creatures with rich, brown coat and a white patch under the tail. They look like deer but they are much  _  . They are less than two feet high. The male barking deer has two small horns but the female has none. They make a  _  rather like a dog barking. Barking deer live in thick shrub country and are very good at  _  . They eat grass and shrubs, mainly in the very early morning and late afternoon and evening. This is when you are most likely to see one but you will need to be very quiet and to have very  _  eyes. In Hong Kong the barking deer has only one  _  ---- man. Although it is illegal, people hunt and trap these harmless little animals. As a result there are now not many left. There are a few on Hong Kong Island but none in the New Territories.",
