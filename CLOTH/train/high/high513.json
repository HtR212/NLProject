    "article": "The Child Is the Center of the Whole Thing\nChildren are amazing. Each one is so different, and they all surprise you. Sometimes it takes a bit of trial and error to inspire them to communicate and learn. A boy I visited this morning was so   _   that he wouldn't say a word. His mother was very quiet, too. He wasn't interested in the books I brought, so I tried a   _   way. We played a game of make-believe by using little toys.   _   he started, he showed great imagination and he was able to   _   his ideas. That's my job as a home visitor -- to model ways that parents can   _   their children's potential  and get them ready for   _  .\nEvery Monday morning, I   _   with the other 17 home   _   working in the Docklands community, and we compare notes. We all arrive in our blue   _   that have become so recognizable in this part of the city.   In fact  , we have people   come up   to us now in the streets as we make our daily rounds, and they ask if we would come to their   _   and help with their children. Twice a week, I visit nine houses. In each one, the mother, the child, and I   sit down   on the floor and play. Sometimes there's a dad or a grandparent, but the child is always at the   _   of our little group, because the child is the point of the whole thing.\nOur job is to give parents   _   about how to play with their children in ways that will   _   learning, language skills, and imagination. We let the child   _   the lead. Any teacher of small kids will tell you that they can   _   the ones whose parents read to them and play with them at home.\nThis week's meeting with the other home visitors was very   _  . Arlene Foster, from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, came in to   _   to us about what we're doing and how it fits in with the Council's plan for early childhood education.",
