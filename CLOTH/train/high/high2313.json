They don't  _  dogs there. We'll find a nice new   _   for you. With your good looks, we'll have no  _  at all. Anyone would be   _  to own such a fine dog.\"\nWith great difficulty, the old man tied a   _  to Monsieur DuPree's neck. It says, \"Merry Christmas! My name is Monsieur DuPree. For breakfast, I like bacon and eggs. For dinner, I prefer potatoes and some meat. I eat just two meals a day.

He didn't want to go. \"Don't make this any   _  for me. I promise you, you'll be much better off with someone else.\"\nAfter a very long time in the snow, they  came across  an old house.
