    "article": "On a Friday night, a poor young artist stood at the gate of the subway station, playing his violin. Many people put some money into the  _  of the young man. The next day, the young artist came again, and put his hat on the ground gracefully.  _  from the day before, he took out a large piece of  _  and laid it on the ground. Then he began  _  . Before long, the young violinist was  _  with people, who were all attracted by the  _  on that paper, which said, \"Last night, a gentleman named George Sang put something important into my hat  by mistake  . Please come to claim it soon.\" After half an hour, a middle-aged man ran there in a hurry and  _  through the crowd to the violinist and said, \"Yes, it's you. You did come here. I knew that you're an honest man and would  _  come here.\" \"Are you Mr. George Sang?\" The man nodded. \"Did you  _  something?\" \"Lottery . It's lottery,\" said the man. The violinist  took out  a lottery ticket on which George Sang' s name was seen. \"Is it?\" he asked. George nodded, seized the lottery ticket and  _  it; then he danced with joy. George bought a lottery ticket which  _  him a prize of $ 500,000. He was so happy after work and felt the violinist playing so wonderfully that he put 50 dollars in the hat.  _  , the lottery ticket was also thrown in. When asked why he didn't keep the lottery ticket  _  himself, the violinist said,\"  _  I don't have much money, I live happily; but if I lose honesty, I won't be happy forever.\" We can gain and lose so much in our life. But being honest should  _  be with us. If we bear ourselves in a dishonest way, we  _  succeed temporarily . However, from the long-term view, we'11 be a loser. Such a person is just like the  _  on the mountain. It's high above at first, but gradually it falls and loses the  _  of going up.",
