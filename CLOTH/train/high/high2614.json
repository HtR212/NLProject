Some children think that they go to school just to\nlearn their mother tongue, English and other foreign languages, history,\nscience,  _  and a few other  _  . But why do\nthey learn these things? Are these the only things they should learn at school?\nActually children go to school to   _  themselves for the time when they will be grown up and\nwill have to  _  themselves. They learn their own\nlanguage  so that  they will be able to  _  with people\nin foreign countries, make friends with them and learn  _  about\ntheir culture and history. They learn mathematics in order to be able to\nmeasure the things around them and calculate sums.  Geography  helps\nthem understand something about the world around them and history teaches them\nabout the past and people. Nearly everything they study at school has some\nuse  _  in their  _  , but there is one\nmore  _  reason why children go to school.\nIt is more important to receive education than just learning   facts  .We go to school  above all  to learn how to learn. Learning is not just for school but for\nlife. So even after we have left school, we have to continue to learn. A man\nwho  _  knows how to learn will always be  _  because\nwhenever he is faced with a completely new task or problem, he will teach\nhimself how to deal with it in the best way.  _  , children do not\ngo to school just to learn languages, mathematics, geography, etc. They go to\nschool to  _  how to learn.",
