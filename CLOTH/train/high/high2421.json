    "article": "I tend to accept any idea put forward by experts on TV. One day, a sociologist proposed that the  _  society has been consuming modern humans little by little. For fear that I would become a victim of the consumer society, I  _  hurried to a bicycle shop in my neighborhood.  _  the shopkeeper Mr. Johnson was selling me the bicycle, he said, \"This is the best thing you  _  have done. Life has become hopelessly  _  . A bicycle is simple, and it brings to you  _  things: fresh air, sunshine and exercise.\" I agreed. Happy as a child, I got on the bicycle and headed out onto the streets. After some time, I  ended up  at the other end of the town. I was  _  that this simple vehicle could let me  _  long distances in a fairly short time. But how  _  did I really go? Since I hated to be  _  , I went back to Mr. Johnson and asked him to  _  an on my bicycle. He agreed, but  _  , \"An odometer without a is like a  _  without a knife.\" I admitted he was right and in a few minutes, the two were  _  to the handlebars of my bicycle. \"What about a horn?\" he then asked. \"Look, this horn is no larger than a matchbox and has many  _  .\" Attracted by these functions, I bought the horn. \"You can't leave the back part  _  ,\" noted Mr. Johnson. He fixed a metal box with buttons  _  the seat, and said, \"Is there anything better than this oven when you feel  _  on your way? I can give you a special discount.\" I was not strong enough to  _  the offer. \"I congratulate you once more; this is the best thing you could have done,\" said Mr. Johnson in the end.",
