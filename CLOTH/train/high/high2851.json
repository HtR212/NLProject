That's an easy question, you say.   _   you go, a minute is 60 seconds, an hour is 60 minutes, a day is 24 hours, and so forth. Well, maybe. But in America, time is   more than   that. Americans see time as a valuable   _  . Maybe that's why they are   _   of the expression, \"Time is money.\"\nTo Americans, punctuality is a way of showing   _   for other people's time. Being more than 10 minutes late to an appointment usually   calls for   an apology, and maybe an explanation. People   _   are running late often call ahead to let others know of the   _  . Of course, the less formal the situation, the less important it is to be exactly   on time  . At informal get-togethers,   for example  , people often arrive as much as 30 minutes past the  _    time. But they usually don't try that at work.\nAmerican lifestyles show   how much   people respect the time of others. When people plan an event, they often   _   the time days or weeks in advance. Once the time is fixed, it takes almost a(n)   _   to change it. If people want to come to your house for a friendly visit, they will usually   _   first to make sure it is convenient. Only very close friends will just   drop by   unannounced. Also, people hesitate to call others late at night for fear they    _   be in bed. The time may vary, but most folks think   _   about calling after 10:00 p.m.",
