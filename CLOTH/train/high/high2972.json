    "article": "At the end of my senior year of high school, I got a job working at a local coffee shop. I thought the job would be   _   and stress-free. I   _   myself pouring the best coffees, making delicious doughnuts  , and becoming friends with   _  .\n                I wasn't expecting the people with enormous orders, the women who complained that the coffee was   much too   creamy, or the men who wanted their iced coffee remade again and again until it reached   _  . I couldn't seem to   _   anyone.\n              One   _   day, one of my regular customers came in looking   _  . He said he felt like getting in bed, pulling the sheets up over his head, and staying there for a few years. I knew exactly how he felt.\n              Before he left, I handed him a bag along with his iced coffee. He was   _  , since he hadn't ordered anything but coffee. I had given him his favorite type of   _  .\n                \"It's my   _  ,\" I told him. \"Have a nice day.\"\n                He smiled and thanked me before heading back out into the rain.\n                The next day, it was still raining. I spent my afternoon hanging   _   the window handing people their orders. I was completely wet and freezing cold.   _  , no one was tipping that day. Every time I looked into our empty tip jar, I grew more depressed.\n                In the evening, the customer from the day before drove up to the window. He handed me a pink rose and a(n)   _  . He said that not many people took time to   _   about others and he was glad there were still people like me in the world. With a friendly   _  , he drove away.\n                I ran to the back of the shop and read the note. It read:\n                Christine,\n                Thanks for being so sweet, kind and   _   yesterday. It is so nice to meet someone who's genuinely nice. Please don't change your   _  ! Have a great day!--Hank\n                After that, whenever I felt   _   or sick of coffee, I thought of Hank and his kindness. Then I would smile,   _   my head up high, clear my throat and ask politely, \"How can I help you?\"",
