    "article": "Last week, it was a delightful surprise to meet my old school teacher. I call her my old school teacher as if she were the   _   one who taught me in school. There\nwere many others too. But the truth is that she is the only one that has stayed\nin my  _  so long, and she is the very one that' s been\nworth keeping.\nI felt   _  and was showing her off as my own\nteacher.  _  that she was my teacher was a lot of fun.\nMaybe she also felt a little  _  to have one  of her own\nstudents like me.\nAlthough my respect for her has always been   _  ---\nI know that if I ever  _  a book, her name will\ngo  on the dedication  page--- actually I've never expressed to he what an impact she has had on my life.   Without  her, I wouldn't\nbe what I am doing. Maybe there would have been some reading, but no love for  _  .\nShe provided the   _  platform  where I exhibited all my mind's contents-- with questions I had no   _  to\nanswer. It seemed that she couldn't answer them either-- for all those important\nquestions in life  _  have answers -- but she took a personal\ninterest in what I had to say, not just as a(n)  _  but as\nanother individual. She  _  me to ask more questions, which\nmade my mind larger and larger  until  it felt like the entire\nworld would be able to make a home in my head. She open my  _  .\nShe actually showed me that there might be something worth   _  with the world. Sometimes I could feel so much excitement in her comments\non what I wrote, about which I used to feel  _  . In fact,\nher  _  for my writing helped me attend to   what I wrote as well. I found what I'm happy doing in life because of the confidence she allowed me to have. I guess I'm   _  that way.",
