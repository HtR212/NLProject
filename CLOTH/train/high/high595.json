I decided to drive to the   _   with my wife and our children to   _  flowers.\nAfter we arrived, we went hiking , played games, and collected all kinds of flowers and so on. How happy we were! Finally, though, we had to   _  our car and got ready to go back home. While the kids chatted and I drove, my wife sat behind me, surrounded by her flowers, a(n)   _   look in her eyes.\nSuddenly my wife   _  to me, \"Stop the car. Stop right here!\"   _   I could ask her what had happened, she was out and  _  up a nearby grassy hill with the lilacs  still in her arms. At the   _   of the hill was a nursing home and , because it was such a beautiful spring day, the   _   were outdoors talking with  s.\nMy wife went up the hill, where an elderly patient was sitting in her   _  , alone with her back to most of the others. My wife   _   the flowers to her and said something. The patient   _   her head and smiled. They talked for a few   _  before my wife ran back. As the car   _   away, I found in the mirror the woman   _   with the lilacs.\n\"Mom,\" the kids asked, \"Who was that? Why did you give her our   _  ? Is she somebody's mother?\" My wife said, \"I didn't know the old woman. But it is Mother's Day. And she seemed so   _  . Who wouldn't be cheered by flowers?  _  ,\" she added, \"I have all of you, and I still have my   _  , even if she is far away. That woman needed those flowers more than I did.\"\nNow, every May, our own yard is   _   with lilacs. Every Mother's Day we drive to the countryside to gather flowers and sow more seeds in our yard. And every year I remember that lonely old woman in her wheelchair, and her smile on her face.",
