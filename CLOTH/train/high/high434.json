    "article": "My classmate Jennifer and I graduated from an ordinary normal university last year. Like most of the students who had just stepped out of university, we had to    go through   the first tough test ---- job hunting to   _    a passport to society. And the most   _   part was the job interview. \nThe   _   was very fierce. Dozens of my classmates, Jennifer  _  , sent our curriculum vitas to a key middle school for a teaching job, making the chance of success as low as 1 to 20. \nBefore the job interview, I   _  complete preparations, including a formal suit, a newly-done hair, a few   _  on job interviews, and even some ancient Chinese poems  in case    I faced a learned interviewer. On that day everything went very  _  . I answered all the questions fluently. So I felt very  _  to get this job. Jennifer was still there waiting for her turn. I made a \"V\"   _    to her. She smiled at me, looking a little worried. I   _  she was not as eloquent  as I, though not worse than me in studies. I felt I had an advantage over her. However, a week later, all of us received letters of  _   . Another week later, guess what happened! She got the job!  _  congratulating her, I asked her how she got it. She said, \"I did   _  . I just wrote them a note of thanks after receiving the letter of refusal.\" Only then     _   I realize why all the applicants had received the same letters and that was also a part of the  _  .\nOnly a note of thanks, but that was what made all the difference. This experience   _  me a good lesson, that is,   _  excellent you are, you should never forget the  _   manners of saying \"Thank you!\".",
