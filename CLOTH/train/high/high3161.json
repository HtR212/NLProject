    "article": "Monty Roberts, owner of a horse ranch in San Ysidro, once told us a story. \"When a young man was a senior, he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to  _  and do when he grew up. In his seven-page paper he described his  _  of someday owning a horse ranch. He drew a  _  floor plan for a 4,000-square-foot house that would  _  on a 200-acre dream ranch. Two days later he received his  _  back. On the front page was a  _  red F. The teacher said, \"This is an  _  dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. \" Then the teacher  _  , \"If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your  _  .\" The boy asked his father what he should do. His father said, \"Look, son, you have to make up your own  _  on this. However, I think it is a very  _  decision for you.\"  _  , after a week, the boy  turned in  the same paper, making no  _  at all. He stated, \"You can keep the F and I'll keep my  _  .\" Monty then turned to us and said, \"I tell you this story  _  you are sitting in my 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace.\" He added, \"The best part of the  _  is that two summers ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week. When the teacher was leaving, he said, \"Look, Monty, I can tell you this now. When I was your teacher, I was  _  of a dream stealer. During those years I stole a lot of kids' dreams.  _  you had enough determination not to give up on yours.\" Don't let anyone  _  your dreams. Follow your heart, no matter what.",
