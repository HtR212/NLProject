    "article": "I will never forget a special trip to the grocery store some years ago. My father had just recently 36 passed away . I was missing him terribly and hardly getting through a day without 37 _ . I needed to pull myself together to get some groceries for my young children.\nAs I entered the store, I 38 _  had to control my emotions as the 39 _  smell of my daddy's favorite cinnamon buns   made there filled the whole 40 _ . I made my way up and down the busy passages and 41 _  my cart   as I read my list, which I had prepared that morning. I was 42 _  the in-store bakery when I just couldn't 43 _  myself any longer. I held the 44 _  and quietly cried as I looked at the cinnamon buns.\nA gentleman came to my 45 _  and simply said, \"Would you like me to 46 _  here with you for a moment?\" I nodded and the man simply put his hand on top of mine, and stood there 47 _  supporting me as I cried. Once I gathered myself, I looked into his wonderful eyes and thanked him, 48 _  I had just lost my father. He simply said there had been such 49 _  in his life too, when he just needed to cry.\nThis man 50 _  me deeply. I realized too many times, we see someone 51 _  and make guesses about the happenings in their life, when really we should recognize we are all 52 _  and just need a little 53 _  sometimes.\nBefore leaving, I 54 _  again in the store for this man, but could not find him. I hope that maybe, he or someone who has done this same thing reads this and learns how the gesture 55 _  the heart of another person.",
