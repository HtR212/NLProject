When  _  for our ice cream we told the cashier that we would like to buy ice cream anonymously for the  _  person who came to the counter as a random act of  _  . Puzzled but excited, she  _  our money and a Smile Card. We sat down at the table near the counter--Rachel wanted to spy on our  _  one. About five minutes later the cashier  _  told us, \"Oh, good! Someone's coming!\" It was a woman with two little kids. As the woman reached for her  wallet  , the cashier, handing her the  Smile Card  , told her that  someone  wanted to, anonymously, buy her family's ice cream. She couldn't  _  it. \"Seriously?\" she asked. Rachel and I  _  not to notice. It was great. The cashier, aware that we wanted to remain anonymous, came over to \"wipe off our table,\"  _  leaving our change on our table. She was about as  _  as we were. After enjoying our ice cream, we took a napkin and wrote a  _  to the cashier thanking her for her assistance. We  _  until she went to the back room, quickly  _  the note, a nice tip, and a second Smile Card on the  _  , and ran out before we were seen. I treasure every date night with my daughter and  _  the world through her eyes is always  _  for me.",
