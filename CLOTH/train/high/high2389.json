    "article": "I recently traveled to San Francisco for some meetings and found myself with a half day to kill. My  _  were to watch a football game or the America's Cup sailing races. Or I could get lost.\nAfter a terribly long line  _  the car rental centre, I was free.  _  I disappeared into the fog and clouds  _  the Pacific Coast Highway and headed south with  _  no destination in mind.\nI  _  through tunnels carved out of the mountains and stopped at a few state beaches; at  _  , I watched a wedding out on the cliffs among the crashing waves.\nBack in the car, I continued toward San Gregorio, a town that you can easily  _  . I know because I was right through it and  ended up  on a pine-tree-bordered ribbon of tar   that felt like it would go on forever.\nA few people moved around  _  the San Gregorio General Store, smoking cigarettes and talking about the motorcycles they've owned  _  the years. Inside, I found a bar with  _  , a guitar duo , and, of course, a  _  store.\nI ordered a beer in the crowded bar,  _  a seat, and watched the guitarists jam out. Then I congratulated them, threw a couple of wrinkled    _  in their bucket, and walked back out into the world.\nThe day could have been so different: crowded into a  _  or bar half-watching sports. But this was much more  _  . Hours before, I was on a flight with the masses, going through the air sickness. Then I was out on my own,  _  an unexpected and unrepeatable experience.\nI learned  _  that day: don't be afraid to get lost - on purpose  or otherwise  - and have zero expectations. It will be good for you. I promise.",
