One day I was dropped off by my parents at the  _  , where applicants took their physical tests for work permits. Although I had night blindness, my vision was clearer during the day, which helped me walk   _   by myself. Then the doctor began the   _  .

If you do, you'll never   _   a day in your life...\" \nMy parents did take me to specialists. After much time and money spent seeking an   _   result, it was determined that I had an eye disease that slowly   _   a person of sight. But still, during daylight, I could walk without   _  . I could read, but not for hours. My eyes began to   _   and words slipped off the page when I read more than a few pages. However, no matter how tired my eyes became, I never gave up reading. I knew the   _   of great writers as well as the most popular music stars. Their words were powerful, which   _   me to try writing.
