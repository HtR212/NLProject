Psychologists tell us that    _   controls our lives more than our self-image. We live like the person we see in the   _  . We are what we think we are.   _   you don't think you'll be successful, you won't. You can't be it if you can't see it. Your life is   limited to   your vision . If you want to change your life, you must change your vision of your life. \n    Arnold Schwarzenegger was not   _   famous in 1976 when he met with a newspaper reporter. The reporter asked Schwarzenegger, \"Now that you've   _   from bodybuilding, what do you plan to do next?\" Schwarzenegger answered very calmly and   _  : \"I'm going to be the best movie star in Hollywood.\" The reporter was   _   and amused at Schwarzenegger's plan. At that time, it was very hard to   _   how this muscle-bound bodybuilder, who was not a   _   actor and who spoke poor English   _   a strong Austrian accent, could ever hope to be Hollywood's movie star! \n    So the reporter asked Schwarzenegger how he planned to make his dream come true. Schwarzenegger said, \"I'll do it the same way I became the best   _   in the world. What I do was to   _   a vision of who I want to be, and   _   I start living like that person in my mind   as if   it were already true.\" Sounds almost childishly simple, doesn't it? But it   _  ! Schwarzenegger did become the first class highest   _   movie star in Hollywood! \n    Remember: \"If you can see it, you can be it.\" A successful businessman I know wears a shirt with these words on it: \"Don't just pursue  your   _  . Chase them down and tackle them!\" You only get one life to live, so why not live the best life possible? So you can be   _   satisfied at what you see and   _  . Just think a minute!",
