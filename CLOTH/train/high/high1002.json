Our  _  challenge was to keep the rock mixture  _  enough. All the available water wagons were rented out for the airport construction, and we certainly couldn't afford to buy a new one.  _  ,I got a special  _  to rent fire engine hoses and connect them to nearby hydrants ;then I  _  held one of those hoses to  _  down the rock.\" \"Those ten days were filled with challenges that  _  one creative idea after another.Nine days later,the night before the airport opened,National Car Rental was the  _  company that had cars on the parking lot.\" \"The key to our success was having the  _  to take on any job and then being creative in our approach to getting it done.\"",
