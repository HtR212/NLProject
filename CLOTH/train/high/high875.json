However, life can be   _  when you are not busy finding fault with it.\nSeveral years ago I  _  a letter from seventeen-year-old Kerry, who described herself as a world-class fault-finder, almost always   _  by things. People were always doing things that annoyed her, and   _  was ever good enough. She was highly self-critical and also found fault with her friends. She became a really   _  person.\nUnfortunately, it took a horrible accident to change her   _  Her best friend was seriously hurt in a car crash. What made it almost   _  to deal with was that the day before the   _  , Kerry had visited her friend and had spent the whole time criticizing her   _   of boyfriends, the way she was living, the way she related to her mother, and various other things she felt she needed to   _  It wasn't until her friend was badly hurt that Kerry became   aware of  her habit of finding fault. Very quickly, she learned to appreciate life rather than to   _   everything so harshly ( ) . She was able to transfer her new wisdom to other parts of her  _  as well.\nPerhaps most of us aren't as extreme at fault-finding,   _   when we're honest, we can be sharply   _  of  the world.

And when you do, you'll get back your enthusiasm and love for life.",
