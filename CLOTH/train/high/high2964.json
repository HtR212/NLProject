    "article": "Janelle used the phone of the helpful woman to call Cliff. Cliff played golf with a medical doctor almost every Saturday. Cliff,  _  but glad his wife was alive, said he would be there  _  . She told him to bring their son and her  _  set of car keys, because her keys were in the  _  purse. Cliff and Donovan arrived just before the police officer finished  filling out  his report. Cliff  _  his wife gently. He told Donovan to drive home in Janelle's car. Cliff then asked the officer what the  _  were of catching the attackers.\nThe officer told Cliff that  _  like this happened daily throughout southern California. Cliff  _  the officer what could be done. \"I know this sounds ridiculous , but we police can  no longer  protect you law-abiding citizens. There are simply too many criminals. Tell all your  _  relatives and friends one thing: Don't go anywhere alone, day or night. A woman by herself, even  in public  , might as well be carrying a bright neon sign that  _  : 'Victim here-Come and get me!' I'm not  _  to be telling you this, because  _  the word gets out, tourism will suffer in southern California.\"\nThe officer asked Janelle to  _  the police report. He wished her a speedy  _  , and promised to do his best to help put the attackers behind bars. He  _  both of them that the two thugs now had their credit cards, address, car keys, and house keys. He suggested that they make the appropriate phone calls,  _  the locks to their house, and get new keys for her car. Cliff told the officer that a couple of his friends were at his house, with guns,  _  for intruders. Cliff and Janelle thanked the officer and the helpful woman. Cliff drove Janelle straight toward their family doctor.",
