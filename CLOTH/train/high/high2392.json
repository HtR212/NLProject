    "article": "When I was about five years old, I used to watch a bird in the skies of southern Alberta from the Blackfoot Blood Reserve in northern Montana where I was born.I loved this bird; I would  _  him for hours.He would  _  effortlessly in that gigantic sky, or he would come down and light on the  _  and float there beautifully.Sometimes when I watched him, he would not make a sound and liked to move  _  into the grasses.We called him meksikatsi, which in the Blackfoot language  _  \"pink-colored feet\"; meksikatsi and I became very good friends. The bird had a very particular significance to me  _  I desperately wanted to be able to fly too.I felt very much as if I was the kind of person who had been born into a world where  _  was impossible.And most of the things that I  _  about would not be possible for me but would be possible only for other people. When I was ten years old, something unexpected  _  my life suddenly.I found myself become an  _  child in a family I was not born into; I found myself in a  _  position that many native Americans find themselves in, living in a city that they do not understand at all, not in another culture but  _  two cultures. A teacher of the English language told me that meksikatsi was not called meksikatsi, even though that is what  _  people have called that bird for thousands of years.Meksikatsi, he said, was really \"duck\".I was very  _  with English.I could not understand it.First of all, the bird did not look like \"duck\", and when it made a  _  , it did not sound like \"duck\", I was even more  _  when I found out that the meaning of the verb \"to duck\" came from the bird. As I  _  to understand English better, I understand that it made a great deal of  _  but I never forgot that meksikatsi made a different kind of meaning.I  _  that languages are not just different words for the same things but totally different  _  , totally different ways of experiencing and looking at the world.",
