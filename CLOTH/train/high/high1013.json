The next morning, they had delicious chicken soup. The friend enjoyed his  _  stay with Nasruddin. When he was  _  , Nasruddin returned his friend's thanks by thanking the  _  for bringing the big chicken along. An hour later, Nasruddin heard a knock on the door. When he opened it, a man  _  himself and  _  entered, \"I'm a friend of your friend who brought you that big chicken!\"\nNot wanting to turn away the  _  of a friend, Nasruddin invited the man inside and  _  him to stay for lunch. The man  _  immediately. They had some lovely chicken cooked for lunch, which the man also enjoyed. After lunch, the man left thanking Nasruddin for the  _  chicken.\nThe next day there was no pause as another  _  entered with the same  _  : \"I am a friend of the friend of the friend who had come here with a huge chicken!\" Nasruddin  _  and asked the man to come right in and have a  _  . A few minutes later, a bowl of soup was  _  before him. Just one sip  told the man that this \"soup\" was nothing but  _  water.\n\"There is nothing in the soup!\" the man protested   _  .\n\"Not at all!\" Nasruddin smiled. \"This is the soup of the soup of the chicken!\"\nMoral of the story: When people  take advantage of  your generosity, don't turn them away rudely. Instead, invite them in and serve them a  _  they will never forget---just as Nasruddin did.",
