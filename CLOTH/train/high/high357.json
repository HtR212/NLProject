    "article": "Our two dogs, Ricky and Lucy have been with us for about ten years. Phil, our youngest is about three years old. We have known one thing over these years. Whenever   _   approach long before we are aware of them, my dogs begin to   _   them. They began to hide and shake. I am   _   sure that they won't eat, either. \nSince this has become part of our lives, whenever we know   in advance  , we will make every   _   to take them into the yard a number of times. Because once the storm is here, fear steps in where nature's calling ends. \nAnyway, it was my recent   _   with Ricky that made me realize that dogs aren't the only ones who have   _   fears. I talked; he listened. I was not sure if he could pay attention to me. Experience has proved that he didn't   _  . He just tried to survive the talk.\n\"Ricky, you've   gone through   these storms so many times before and nothing   _   has happened to you\" I said. \"It's just sound\" I reasoned. \"Sound has never   _   you.\" Regardless of my comforting words, he   _   to shake a bit. \n  _  , this talk brought to light a new inspiration: we people do   _   things. We fear things that we have no real   _   of or no past experience with and build upon that fear without logic. People say \"It's how I feel.\" Actually, that's the exact   _   for many limitations people have come to call failures in lives. There's no real evidence indicating that we should   _   going to school, starting a new job, asking for a raise and so on.\nDogs just don't have the   _   to find reasonable alternative choices. We do. So, when you're terrified next time, just   _   me talking to Ricky. Know that you do have better   _  , higher intelligence and the ability to take control of a situation.",
