Every time he drove by the lifeless animal that had  _  in the road, Steven  _  think of his daughter. And so he continued trying to teach her the  _  -- with little  _  . Then one day as Steven was driving home, he saw something that helped  _  an idea, which became an action by the time he got home. He walked over to where Marry was playing. \"Come on, sweetheart,\" he said. \"You and Daddy are going for a  _  .\" They drove back along the way he had just traveled, finally  _  just behind a mound of something. \"What is it, Daddy?\" Marry asked as they got out of the  _  . \"Look  _  , but don't touch it,\" Steven said. \"Can't you tell what it is?\" She studied it for a few minutes, unsure of its  _  until she picked out its familiar ears. \"A rabbit! What happened?\" Marry asked. \"It was playing in the road, and a car came along and ...\" \"... and squished it?\" Marry broke  _  . \"That's right,\" Steven said. \"It got squished because it was playing in the road.\" \"Yuck!\" Marry said. For the first time, Steven saw  _  in his daughter's eyes. The next evening, when Steven drove by a group of children playing in the street, he  _  what Marry was shouting from the sidewalk. \"Come on, you guys!

This is Steven's lesson.",
