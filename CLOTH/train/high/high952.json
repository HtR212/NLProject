    "article": "One day I returned home to my daughter's third-year birthday party to find her in the front room, grasping all of her presents, unwilling to let the other children play with them. The first thing I noticed was several parents in the room  _  this selfish display. I was embarrassed.\nThe atmosphere in the room was really charged--the children were  _  around my little daughter with their hands out, asking to play with the presents they had just  _  , and my daughter was  ly refusing. I said to myself, \"Certainly I should teach my daughter to  _  . The value of sharing is one of the most basic things we believe in.\"\nSo I first tried a simple  _  . \"Honey, would you please share with your friends the toys?\"\n\"No,\" she replied  _  . \nMy second method was to use a little  _  . \"Honey, if you learn to share your toys with them when they are at your home, then when you go to their homes they will share  _  with you.\"\nAgain, the immediate reply was \"No!\"\nI was becoming  _  embarrassed, for it was  _  I was having no influence. The third method was to  _  rewards. Very softly I said, \"Honey, if you share, I'll give you a candy.\"\n\"I don't want that!\" she exploded.\nNow I was getting  _  . For my fourth attempt, I started to fear and  _  . \"Not sharing, you will be in real trouble!\"\n\"I don't care!\" she cried. \"These are my things. I don't have to share!\"\nFinally, I tried to  _    . I merely took some of the toys and gave them to the  _  kids. \"Here, kids, play with these.\"\nBut at that moment, I valued the opinion those parents had of   _  more than the growth of my child and our relationship together. I simply made an  _  judgment that I was right; she should share, and she was  _  in not doing so.\nMy experience has been that there are times to teach and times not to teach. When relationships are  _  , an attempt to teach is often considered as a form of judgment and  _  . But to take the child alone, quietly, when the relationship is good and to discuss the teaching or the value seems to have much greater impact.",
