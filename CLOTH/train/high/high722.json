I thought it was quite  _  and was not worried about the results. The next day after class, my math teacher told me that I had the lowest grade in the class! I felt so ashamed. I  _  Hannah not to tell anyone else, and she said she would  _  my secret.  _  , the next day, I noticed that my classmates were  _  at me as I came into math class and, when I went to sit down, I was shocked to find a piece of paper on my desk that said, 'Stupid Sarah got a D!' I thought that Hannah  _  have told my classmates about my grade after promising not to. I was so angry that I went  _  to Hannah and told her we weren't going to be friends any more. She was really upset and swore that she hadn't told  anyone  , but I didn't believe her explanation. I don't think I can ever truly forgive her. Now I have  _  my best friend. What shall I do? Yours sincerely, Sarah",
