Charley took one look at my face and she\ncould  _  I was off in another world.\nCharley said, \"You have that  _  on your face!\nTell me what you were  _  \". \"Well,\nCharley,\" I replied, \"I was listening to a song on the radio that asked  _  you have done over the last year. When I  _  on the year, I've realized I have had such good fortune, with a few\nbumps   along the way.\"\n   Charley immediately asked, \"Tell me about the three things that   _  you\nthe most during this year.\"\n   I sat thinking if I had to   _  only three things that influenced me, what would they be? After a few\nminutes, I said, \"OK, here are the three things that influenced me the most: My\nfamily. Throughout the year I had many  _  ,\nbut my family were always there  _  support\nand encouragement. My friends. Over the years I have  _  my dreams and my goals with my friends. Some goals I have  _  and other goals I have not.  _  friends like you always supported and  _  me. My colleagues. I have worked with some  _  people over the last year. I have been very  _  to have the opportunity to work with these excellent people over the\nlast year.\"\n   Charley smiled and said, \"Do you realize that everything you have said has one thing in  _  ?\"\n   \"What are you saying, Charley?\" I asked. \n   She replied, \"One common thing is   _  . Neither the material things in your life, nor your job has had the most\nmeaning in your life. It is the people in your life that have made the biggest  _     in your life!\"\n   I smiled. Material things are not   _  , and while our jobs provide the means of existence for us, the important things in life are the people who touched our lives.",
