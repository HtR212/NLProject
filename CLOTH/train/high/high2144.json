And it's booming.\nThe number of jobs for translators and interpreters doubled in the past 10 years while their wages steadily  _  before, during and after the recession. During a period of stagnating   wages across the labor market, the language-service industry with its 50,000 jobs is a  _  spot in the jobs outlook.\nLillian Clementi is a French translator working in corporate communications from her home in Arlington, Massachusetts and is routinely on tight deadlines to hand in translated material. \"The risks can be huge,\" said Clementi, \"There's tons of  _  pressure.\"\nIn some cases, a(n)  _  translation or interpretation is also vital. If a user's guide for medical equipment is not translated well, it could lead to  _  during an emergency. Soldiers in conflict areas require excellent interpreters to speak with community members. Any change of tone or context could put lives  at risk  .\nTranslators' and interpreters' immunity   to the nation's economic downturn also  _  the growing demand for people who can speak several languages in an increasingly globalized economy, experts said.\n\"Good translators who  specialize in  a particular subject and become really good at it can really make six-digit figures annually,\" said Jiri Stejskal, spokesman for the American Translators Association.\nMultinational corporations, U.S. demographic   changes and the Internet economy raise the need for translated and localized information.

Speaking two languages does not mean a person can work in the language-service industry, experts said. Learning how to translate or interpret is a  _  skill beyond knowing the language.\nFurthermore, the most successful translators and interpreters maintain a  _  , such as legal documents, quarterly earnings reports or a special knowledge of industry.\nTechnological advances may cut jobs in some industries, but online translation services like Google Translate  _  raise demand for human translators and interpreters, experts said. Online sales companies also drive demand for translation.",
