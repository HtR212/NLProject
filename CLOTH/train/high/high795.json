    "article": "\"We've been good friends for so many years. And I don't think you meant to do that ...\" I said to myself, looking at Jack, my friend who was running across the  _  field. How I wish I could join them! But it was impossible because of the pain in my left foot, caused by Jack. I first met Jack in a football match in the elementary school. When my team looked as if we were  _  , Jack, who was watching, volunteered to join us. He was so confident and skilled that we won. From then on, Jack and I often played together and became best friends. But something happened before an important football match between Class Six and my class. My class had so many good players that we had to  decide on  the best ones. Jack and I were in the same team. The match was close in the first half. I saw my chance and was ready to score a goal. Suddenly, Jack  ran into  me. He slid to stop the ball, but collided with my left foot. I knew I had lost the chance to score and was  carried off  the field. But what really hurt me was that Jack didn't say sorry. And when some of my teammates said he did it on purpose to  _  me from scoring, I felt even  _  . Now I stand here, with tears in my eyes. I don't want to  _  those words but I don't know how to persuade myself they are  _  . Then everything changes when Jack scores and wins! How excited I am! While I am still  _  in excitement, someone pats my shoulder. It is Jack, with a smile on his face. \"I'm sorry that you can not join in because of my  _  . But you see, Jason, we beat them! No matter whether you joined in or not, you've made a contribution. Come on, let's celebrate!\" Suddenly, I am  raised up  by the players. The sunshine is so bright that I close my eyes. Riding high above my teammates, I feel so happy. And I know the friendship between Jack and me will last forever.",
