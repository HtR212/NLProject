I've often thought those lovely blue flowers from the  _  would look great in that bed alongside other wildflowers. Everyday I  _  past the flowers thinking, I'll stop on my way home and  _  them.\" \"gee , I don't want to get my good clothes dirty...\" whatever the reason, I  _  stopped to dig them. One day on my way home from work in my car, I was  _  to see the highway department had moved the ditches and the pretty blue flowers were  _  . I thought to myself, \"You  _  too long. You should have done it when you first saw them  _  this spring. \" A week ago, we were shocked and saddened to learn my older sister-in-law had a terminal brain tumor . She is 10 years  _  than my husband and unfortunately, because of age and distance. We haven't been as  _  as we all would have liked. I couldn't help but see the  _  between the pretty blue flowers and the relationship between my husband's  _  and us.
