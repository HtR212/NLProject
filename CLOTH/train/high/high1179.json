    "article": "Love cures people--both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it. ----Dr. Karl Menninger I was being interviewed by a senior manager for a major insurance company. I told him  _  that the main reason why I was  _  with them was my need to keep my family in Boston. My wife of 26 years old had recently died of a heart attack . A(n)  _  in Boston would also help me reduce some of the pain of the loss. Bruce ,the interviewer ,was politely sympathetic, and didn't probe any  _  .He acknowledged my loss and ,with great respect ,moved on to another  _  . After the next  _  of interview , Bruce took me to lunch with another manager .Then he asked me to take a  _  with him. He told me that he ,  _  , had lost his wife .And he had also been married 20 years and had three children. In his sharing, I realized that he had  _  the same pain  _  I had , a pain that was almost  _  to explain to someone who had not  _  a loved  _  . He offered his business card and home phone number and  _  that, if I needed help or just wanted someone to  talk to  , I should feel  _  to give him a call. No matter whether I got the job or not, he wanted me to know that he was there if I  _  needed any help. From that one act of kindness, when he had no idea  _  we would see each other again, he helped me  deal with  one of life's greatest losses. He turned the normally  _  business interview process into an act of caring and support for another person in a time of need.",
