A crew had been working on it for two weeks,  _  every time they finished one problem, another surfaced. We decided the only reasonable  _  was to build a new house-something unusual but  _  under these circumstances. The family was  _  with their new house. While we ate lunch together, I asked the family's three boys, Josh, Eric and Ryan,\"What do you want for your new  _  ?\"we were  _  when Josh responded,\"I just want a bed.\" The boys had  _  slept in a bed! They were accustomed to plastic mats. we decided beds would be the perfect  _  . A few volunteers drove to the nearest city and  _  beds and new bedding. When we saw the delivery truck coming, we told the family about the  _  . We could hardly  _  ourselves. It was like watching  _  children on Christmas morning. As we  _  the frames of the beds together, Eric ran into the house to  _  us. As my father slipped a pillowcase onto one of the pillows, Eric asked, \"What is that?\" \"A pillow,\"he replied. \"What do you  do with  it?\"Eric continued to ask. \"When you go to sleep, you put your  _  on it,\"I answered softly. Tears came to our eyes as he handed Eric the pillow. \"Oh . . . that's soft,\"he said,  _  it tightly. Now, when my sister or I start to ask for something that seems urgent, my Dad gently asks,\"Do you have a pillow?\"We know exactly what he  _  .",
