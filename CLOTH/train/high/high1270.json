    "article": "Before I turned 29, my parents moved to Queensland, where I arrived for a visit six months later. I  _  upon my mother with hugs, and for the first time in my life I said, \"I love you, mom!\" Then I gently  pulled away  , expecting some kind of reciprocation. But it never came. Instead, she appeared  _  in horror.\nWhen I was back at work, I overheard a workmate on a call to her mother and she concluded it with \"I love you, Mum.\" As  _  as that. Why wasn't it like that in mine? Something had to be done about this  _  situation once and for all.\nMy  _  came the next Sunday during my weekly phone call to my mother. After we had shared our usual pleasantries and  _  , I took a deep breath and asked, \"Do you love me, Mum?\" After a short  _  , she replied, \"I love you. Don't be silly. You know we never said things like that in my family.\"\n\"Well, I want it to be said in ours. From now on I want to  _  our conversations with 'I love you.'\"\nIn May 2000 my mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She was  _  to hospital, and I phoned every day to  check on  her. One evening when I rang, a nurse answered the phone and regretfully informed me that my mother's condition had rapidly worsened. She wasn't expected to  _  it through the night.\nKnowing I couldn't get a flight in time, I asked the nurse to put the phone next to my mother's ear so I could talk to her. \"She's  _  conscious,\" the nurse replied. \"It's unlikely she'll hear you.\" But I didn't care. I wanted to do it  _  .\n  _  she'd placed the phone by my mother's ear, I started  _  and telling Mum over and over again that I loved her. At first, all I could hear was \"Hmmmm\"--but then, like a miracle, with a deep  _  she said, \"Love you ... love you, darling.\" It was the last thing she said before drifting into  _  .\nAlthough I was overwhelmed by her death, the surprising part was how well I  _  . Of course, losing a parent is extremely painful and I shed many tears, but receiving those lovely last words made it much more  _  . I had closure in the best possible way.",
