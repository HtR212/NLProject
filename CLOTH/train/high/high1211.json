In the fighting between two countries in the 1970s, a young man was walking from one village to the next when he was  _  by an armed guerrilla fighter from the enemy country.The fighter  _  the young man down the hill where he was to be  _  But a(n)  _  thing happened. The young man, who had  _  military training, was able to disarm the fighter.Now, the table was  _  and it was the fighter who was ordered down the hill. As they walked,  _  , the young man began to reflect on what was happening.Recalling the  _  of his mother, \"Love your enemies; do good to those who  _  you.\" He found he could go no farther. He  _  the gun into the bushes, told the fighter he was  _  to go and turned back  _  the hill. Minutes later, he heard footsteps  _  behind him as he walked.\"Is this the end after all?\" he  _  . Perhaps the fighter had got the gun and wanted to finish him off.But he continued on,  _  glancing back, until his enemy reached him, only to grab him in a hug and pour out  _  for sparing his life. Mercy often wears the face of  _  .And though it usually isn't an enemy in uniform-that we are challenged to forgive, we have  _  for mercy every day. Family members and friends, co-workers and neighbors and even strangers have  _  for our forgiveness. You know who they are. As Mahatma Gandhi said, \"The  _  can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong. \" Be strong. Forgive.",
