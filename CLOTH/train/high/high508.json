You can't be a  _  person all of the time. How do you do it?\" Jerry replied, \"Each morning I wake up and say to myself you have two  _  today. You can choose to be in a good mood  _  you can choose to be in a bad mood. I choose to be in a good mood. It's your choice  _  you live life.\" Several years later, I heard that Jerry did something you are never  _  to do in the restaurant business.... He  _  the back door open one morning and was held up at  _  point by three armed robbers. He was shot by them while trying to fight back.  _  , Jerry was found relatively quickly and  _  to the local trauma center. After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Jerry was released  _  the hospital with fragments of the bullets  _  I saw Jerry about six months after the  _  . Jerry told me something happening in the ER( ). He said, \"... the paramedics were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ER and I saw the  _  on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really  _  . In their eyes, I  _  'he's a dead man.' I knew I needed to take  _  .\" \"What did you do?' I asked. \"Well, there was a nurse shouting questions at me,\" said Jerry. \"She asked  _  I was allergic to anything. ' Yes' I replied. The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, 'BULLETS!' Over their  _  , I told them, 'I am choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead'.\" Jerry lived thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have the choice to live fully. Attitude,  after all  , is everything.",
