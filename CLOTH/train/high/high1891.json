Maybe you've heard the saying, \"A bird with a  _  wing will never fly as high.\" I'm sure that T. J. Ware was made to  _  this way almost every day. At high school, T. J. was the best-known troublemaker in his town. He was a silent boy, didn't answer questions and often  _  .\nI met T. J. for the first time at an activity aimed at getting students more involved in community charity. When I  turned up  , the community leaders  _  me that T.J. had the longest arrest  record in the history of town. Actually, I wasn't the first to hear about T.J.'s darker side as the first words of  _  .\nAt the start of the activity, T. J. was just  _  outside the circle of students, against the back wall, with a(n)  _  look on his face. He didn't readily join the discussion groups, and didn't seem to have much to say. But gradually, the interactive games  _  him in. T. J. shared his great thoughts on  _  . The other students  _  his ideas and were impressed with his passion for helping those in need.  _  , they elected T. J. co-chairman of the group.\nAfter the activity, T. J. started showing up at school and being active in class, which none of his teachers expected. More  _  , two weeks later, T. J. led a group of 70 students in a drive to collect   _  .

J. reminds us that a bird with a broken wing only needs  _  . Once it has  _  , it can fly higher than the rest. Now T. J. is  _  quite nicely as a chairman of a nationwide charity organization.",
