    "article": "We always celebrated Dad's  November birthday on Thanksgiving Day,  even  after he entered a nursing home.As years went on,these events   took on  a double meaning for me-a traditional birthday party for Dad, and a  _  to express my thanks for  _  he had been to me in my life.\nKnowing it might be his   _  birthday,\nthe whole family rearranged Thanksgiving plans and came together for a huge\nGrandpa Simon birthday  _  at the nursing home. With so many people\ngathering around him.Dad was having the time of his life. He was a great   storyteller  , and here\nwas the biggest audience he'd  _  had.\nDuring a quiet moment, I announced that it was now Dad's   _  to listen to some stories for a change. I wanted everyone\nto tell Grandpa Simon what we loved about him.\n  One after another  ,people began to tell storied form their hearts, while Dad listened with wet,   _  blue eyes. People\nrecalled all kinds of  _  memories-stories about when they were little,\nstories about when Dad was young, stories that are shared family treasures.\n  The stories   _  .  Each\none seemed to have more to tell. Even the littlest grandchildren couldn't wait\nto tell Dad  _  they loved him. For a man who had been kind to so many\npeople in his life, here was our chance to  _  him.\nA few months later, at Dad's memorial service, we more   _  realized what we had given Dad that night. Those\nstories are normally told, full of  _  , at a funeral after a loved one\nis no longer around, hoping that the  _  will somehow hear the outpouring\nof love. But we had given those loving memories to Dad in life, told  _  laughter,  accompanied by hugs and joy.\nWords do matter,   _  they are enough.\nWe just need to  _  them publicly to the ones we love. That's the way to\ngive back love, and our chance to celebrate a person in life.",
