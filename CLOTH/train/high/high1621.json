    "article": "Having written a book on rock music and a book on jazz music, and now writing a book  _  the classical music of the 20 century, I felt the  _  to put somewhere the music that does not quite fit  _  of these kinds of music. I also felt that I needed to research the beginning of the popular music in Western Europe and the USA in order to  _  understand the change of the jazz and rock music. I also felt that ethnic music has become so  _  that one should research the development from Western European and USA music. This book aims at  _  all these gaps . I did my best to give it a systematic feeling, although it is clear that musicians from such different parts of the world had very  _  in common. Only after the joining together of the 1907s can we  _  of a worldwide history of popular music. This book is about the  _  of that formation . It was not very difficult to decide how to  _  jazz music from pop music. It was much more  _  to decide how to separate rock music  _  the rest of popular music, because rock music has taken in just about everything. Pieces of this book were firstly written for my 2003 books on rock music.  _  that happened after the 1960s will be in the book on rock music. The  _  is that you should read this book first, then the  _  of jazz music and the history of rock music.",
