That night he wrote a seven - paper  _  his dream of owning a farm. He put a great deal of his  _  into the paper and the next day he handed it in to his  _  . Two days later he received his paper back. On the  _  page was a large red F with a  _  that read, \"See me after class.\" The boy went to see the teacher after class and asked, \"  _  did I receive an F?\" The teacher said, \"This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like  _  .
