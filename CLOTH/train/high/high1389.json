So perfect timing is stuck to  so that  there is no confusion; but  _  , as I found out, there is. When I  _  Kalyani's invitation to her wedding, I made a note of it in my diary. She had been my schoolmate and we had got along well, so  _  I was happy to attend her wedding. l decided to  _  for it and borrowed an Indian style shirt. On the day of the wedding, I arrived at the temple in good time and started to  look for  anyone I knew. I saw no one and went to sit cross-legged quietly in a corner, waiting. Kalyani was escorted in. From where I was sitting, I could not see  _  but I thought she had  _  a little since she left school. She looked a little fat now and wore glasses. I  _  my head. Anyway I  _  down to wait for the long ritual. As soon as the wedding was over, a line formed to  _  the couple and I joined in. When I arrived and handed her the  _  , she looked up and  _  a beautiful smile and only then did I realize that the  _  was entirely mine: it was not Kalyani at all. I had just attended the  _  wedding. To  _  my shock, I smiled broadly.  _  , I was treated like a guest: the couple  _  each have thought I was the other's guest. Then I went to look for the correct wedding party in the  _  area. Sure enough there stood Kalyani. As I was walking up to her, I realized I was in deep  _  : I had just given the present meant for her to a complete stranger.",
