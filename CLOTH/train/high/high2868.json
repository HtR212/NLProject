One of the things that  _  me recently is what I learned from turtles .\nTurtles could teach a vast number of people a lot about reaching goals.  For example  , have you ever watched turtles making their way to a stream? Turtles  _  where they are going. In other words, they have set a goal. Many people  _  go through life with no specific goals in mind. They seem to weave  back and forth because their life direction seems to  _  in relation to whatever influences them at the time.\nTurtles, on the other hand, have a set goal in mind  _  observed by taking the time to watch them. Turtles have only one  _  . No matter how long it takes them, they will do everything they can to  _  their objective.\nSure, turtles may be  _  . But they keep going. Each step they take, no matter how small, keeps them  _  to their destination. They never  _  a step or break into a run. The reason is that turtles have a better  _  of the necessity of taking small steps over and over again to reach final victory.\nThe  _  thing about turtles is that they have hard shells. The significance of this shell is to help  _  themselves from anything that may attack them. And, as turtles taught me, we also need to develop a hard shell  _  those that would want us to fail.\n  _  , turtles told me that the greatest characteristic to  _  in reaching a goal is perseverance . No matter what the obstacle is, there is a(n)  _  around it. No matter how many times one is  _  by negativity, there is strength in belief.",
