    "article": "Several years ago, some people told me I was really stupid and laughed at me. I   _   it. All my life, I achieved grades that were only fairly   _  , and over time I felt I couldn't catch up with my classmates. I thought I would never achieve great achievements  . I felt a sense of shame and a sense of   _  . \nI didn't get accepted into the course I wanted,   _   I was most upset. My dad told me, \"You have two   _  . Do a pre-university course or take up an easier course.\" I thought for a long time and   _   made the decision that changed my whole life. I flew to another city, enrolled   in a pre-university course and   _   very successfully. \nOf course, it wasn't that   _  . While I was doing my course, it was difficult. I   _   and I wouldn't give up. I decided that I was going to   _   to everyone that I could make it. The greatest force that kept me moving was the lasting   _   from my family and my best friends. They never looked down on me and they were supportive all the way through. \nI had a strong will. I just kept   _   myself. Over and over again the situation convinced me to   give up   but I did not! I told myself I was going to start a new life. Exams came and went and the   _   were out. I was   _  . It was my first exam since I started my new life. And I did it. \nLooking back on my life, I find all the criticism   that I've received is now not only a(n)   _   for me to do better, but something that tells me that no one can   _   you who you are. I've learnt no one will be able to   _   me. Everything is up to me. Whatever I choose or whoever I   _   to be, it's all up to ME!\nI may not be a   _   person but I have a strong will.",
