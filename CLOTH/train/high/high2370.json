    "article": "I loved working with my dad, but I hated a summer job he gave me. He owned a small  _  in Bank Street. In his shop, the most recently  _  person got the worst job, and the boss' son was also  _  \nI didn't want to spend hours  cleaning up  the frost on the ceiling of the walk-in freezer, and it was the Saturday afternoon's job that I hated most. We received fresh  _  every day. Chicken sat in wooden boxes and was  _  with crushed ice. During the week, the ice and the blood of the chicken slowly leaked into the container  _  the chicken, creating its bloody smell.\nThere was only one  _  to get rid of the blood and wash the container: hold my  _  and carefully slide the container from under the chicken, as I tried not to  _  the contents over my clothes, and then  _  into the drain .\nSoon, students who have cut lawns, painted houses, worked in offices,  _  maybe even worked in the butcher's will  _  to school. Some will have great memories  _  others will come back with  _  ones.\nLooking back, I think my father could have  _  me from my weekly hell. However, my dad, who'd dropped out of school to help support his family after his father died, was a teacher for me  in fact  . He knew treating me  _  from his other employees would be an unfair thing. Most importantly, he taught me to  _  hose who do the hard and  _  tasks in life.\nFor the next six summers, I returned not as the boss' son, but as one of other guys, and I cleaned the dirty container every Saturday afternoon.",
