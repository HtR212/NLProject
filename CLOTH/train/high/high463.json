    "article": "Buddy, five years old, is traveling with his parents to enjoy a taste of adventure. He is only 600 miles away from  _  the youngest-ever hiker to complete the Appalachian Trail  .  _  they started their journey, they were told that the youngest person to ever  _  the trail was a six-year-old who hiked it in 1980. The couple hadn't set out to  _  any records. \"We don't know he was setting the record  _  until after we started.\" his mother said.\nThe group travels  _  . They just have the main  _  item being an iPad Mini that they use to plot   their route and  _  shelters along the way. They also have a Jeep to get them to the trail heads each day, a  _  that has sheltered them through all kinds of weather, and a Marmot thick jacket to protect Buddy on  _  trails. They post updates about Buddy's progress and  _  to their website.\nInstead of going to  _  Buddy has the outside world as his classroom and listens to  _  CDs. \"He hikes with educational music, which is  _  . He's learning French, he's learning to count, spell, add and subtract   while he hikes without the  _  of other kids or being in the classroom. He can focus on his study,\" his mother said.\nThe couple  _  that unlike other hikers Buddy's age gave him the  _  of unlimited energy. \"He  _  hurts the next morning like most hikers do. He's had it  _  than most hikers,\" his parents said.\nThe adventures of the youngster, who has scaled mountains, camped in snow and met wild horses, will be  _  into a children's book once he has completed the last 600 miles. They plan to finish on New Year's Eve.",
