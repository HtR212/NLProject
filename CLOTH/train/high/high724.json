Bob had   _   made a \"motherhood contract \"--declaring that for 70 days this summer he would   take over    the care of their four children and all the housework.   _   he didn't even know how to make coffee when he signed, he was very confident.\nAfter 40 of the 70 days, he was ready to   give up  . \"I was beaten down,\" admits Bob. \"Not only is motherhood a   _   task, it is an impossible job for any normal human being. \"\nBob and Pat were married in 2008. After they married, Pat   worked as   a secretary to help put him through university.   Since then   Bob has been the football coach while Pat raised the kids.   _   two years ago Pat went back to work. \"I had been   _   children so much,\" she   _  , \"I couldn't talk to a grown-up.\" She continued to run the household,   _   -- until Bob signed the contract.\nBob tried hard to learn cooking, but the meals he prepared were   _  . For the last three weeks, the family   ate out   a lot--- sometimes having MacDonald's hamburgers for lunch and dinner.\n  As for   housekeeping, a home economics teacher had told Bob that a room always looks clean   _   the bed is made. \"I found   an easier way   -I shut the doors,\" he says. Soon the kids were wearing their shirts inside out. \"When we went to   _   Pat at work, I made them wear their shirts   _   side out so they would look clean.\"\nNow that Bob has publicly   _   he was wrong, he is   _   the child-raising and household tasks with Pat.",
