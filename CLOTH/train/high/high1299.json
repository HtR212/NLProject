    "article": "My grandparents built and lived in a small 600-square-foot cottage for most of their adult lives. They actively practiced living a  _  life. Saving and avoiding overspending was their life  _  for their whole life.  Rather than  seeking satisfaction through material items, they chose to spend  _  time together, with family, and in nature. Over the years my grandparents noticed  _  changes in their community. Every year more farmland was  _  to build larger and larger homes. With houses' prices  going up  , many of their neighbors sold their little homes and lands.  _  only their small house was still on the block, surrounded by a sea of tall buildings. Countless family members  _  my grandparents to expand their home. But they didn't want a bigger place and were  _  with what they had. In many ways, I've modeled my life after my grandparents. Through their example I learned an important  _  : It is absolutely possible to live a small and fulfilling life. My grandparents lived in a small home, but they owned a(n)  _  garden. They loved gardening deeply because it not only  _  their grocery bill, but also improved their health and gave them a(n)  _  to be outside. They said, \"  Even if  you live in a small home or an apartment, you don't have to give up gardening.\" My grandparents avoided lifestyle creep by paying for their own home in cash and building it themselves. They also recycled and  _  everything. For instance, they drove the same car for over 15 years and didn't buy anything new until their stuff was  _  worn out. My grandparents taught me that living well on  _  isn't about feeling bad for myself.  On the contrary  , it's about giving yourself the time, freedom, and money to seek your dreams. You know: Becoming debt free, living in a smaller home, and others are a few ways to  _  your life.",
