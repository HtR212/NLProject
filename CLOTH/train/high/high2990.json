It's our responsibility to   _  the customer.\nI remember my first   _  job was at a fine restaurant. One afternoon, the manager informed all the cooks and waiters that a VIP   _  43were coming for lunch. The group were   made up of  VIPs in the city's fashion industry.\nAfter the group arrived and got   _  comfortably, drinks were   _  . Normally, the head waiter would be in charge of wine service.   _  , the manager asked me to serve that afternoon. I had   _  done wine service, nor had I ever served a group of twelve.\nI arranged 12 wine glasses on the tray and went to the table. As I   _  one of the glasses in front of the first customer, somehow I had   _  my grip (,) and six glasses fell on top of a young woman, and then to the floor and   _  in pieces. I felt frightened and my face turned red. I apologized many times to the   _  and to the rest of the group.\nQuickly, the manager   came to  my aid and helped in the cleanup, and sent out their drinks right away. I didn't understand why, but the group were forgiving me and the young woman   _  informed me it was OK.\nMy manager pulled me to the side and said, \"If you know why an accident happened,   _  from it and move on. You still have a table to serve and you can't show your   _  or your disappointment. Mistakes and accidents do happen. Keep your   _  up and be confident. The glasses are replaceable.\"\nI understood why he was truly a well   _  restaurant manager within the neighborhood. His   _   relationship with the group made the situation   _  and the group forgave me for that.",
