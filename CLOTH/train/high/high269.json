The tide was rushing to the entrance and  _  to the wild open sea. She had to row across the bay to reach  the other  side. The waves struck against the side of the boat,  _  and uneven; it became  _  difficult to row. If she  _  for a moment, the tide would push the boat back towards the  _  . She wasn't even halfway,  _  she was already tired and her hands  _  from pulling on the rough wooden oars . \"I'm never going to  _  it\", she thought. She rested the oars on her knees and  _  her head helplessly, then looked up as she  _  the boat shift against the tide. The east wind , which had swung around from the south-west,  came to  her help and pushed the boat towards the mountains. It was going to be  all right  . Her hands weren't so painful. Her chest didn't feel as if it was about to burst  any more  . The lights of the town became  _  . one of the oars banged against the side of the boat and she  _  it with a start. Had she been asleep, or just  _  ? She looked over her shoulder. She was almost on the beach. The girl gave one last  _  on the oars to ground the boat, and then lay back against the seat. She listened to the waves  _  and knew she had come home. Far across the moonlit bay the lights were no more than a sparkling chain.",
