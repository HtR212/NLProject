Once in a while, they hear them just in time.\nI met Connie the day she was  _  to the ward , where I worked as a(n)  _  . Her husband, Bill, stood  _  nearby as she was transferred to the hospital bed. Although Connie was in the final stages of her fight  _  cancer, she was alert  and cheerful. We got her  settled in  . I finished marking her name on all the hospital supplies she would  be using  , and then asked if she needed other things.\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said, \"Would you please  _  me how to use the TV? I enjoy the soaps so much and I don't want to get behind on what's happening.\" As we became  _  , she told me how  _  it was to be married for 32 years to a man who often called her \"a silly woman\".\n\"Oh, I know Bill loves me,\" she said, \"but he has  _  been one to say he loves me, or send cards to me.\" She  _  . \"I would give anything if he'd say 'I love you,' but it's just not in his  _  .\"\nBill visited Connie every day. In the  _  , he sat next to the bed while she was  _  the soaps. Later, when she began  _  more, he paced up and down the hallway outside her room. Soon, when she no longer watched television and had  _  waking moments, I began spending more of my volunteer time with Bill.\nA few days later, when I knew from the head nurse that Connie  had died  , I went into the room to say my own  _  to Connie. There, on the  _  table, was a large Valentine card from Bill that says, \"To my wonderful  _  ... I love you.\"",
