After only seconds of playing, one of the strings on his violin  _  .The audience immediately knew what happened and fully expected the concert to be  _  until another string or even another insrument could be found. But Perlman  _  them. He quickly calmed down, closed his eyes and then  _  the conductor to begin again.So the orchestra played from where they had  left off  and Perlman played on three strings. He played  _  passion and power. All the time he worked out new fingering in his mind to make up for the  _  string. A work that few people  _  play well on four strings Perlman accomplished on three.\nWhen he finished, a(n)  _  silence hung in the room.And then as one, the crowd rose to their feet and  _  wildly.Applause burst forth from every corner of the auditorium  _  fans showed deep  _  for his talent and his courage. Perlman smiled and wiped the sweat from his forehead.Then he raised his bow to  _  the crowd and said, not proudly, but in a  _  , quiet, holy tone, \"You know. sometimes it is the artist's  _  to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.\"\nSuch was Itzhak Perlman. a great violinist. Playing a concert on three strings is not unlike his philosophy of life -- he  held on to  what he had left and still made music.And isn't that true with us?As for me I'm  _  that the world, more than ever, needs the music only you and I can make.",
