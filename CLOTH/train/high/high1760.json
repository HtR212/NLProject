    "article": "University Can Wait\nI was on my way to the library to do some studying for history class. That's when I saw my friend and her family   _   on doors.\nAs I was standing   _   one house, my friend's brother walked past me and went to the door of the house. When the resident   _   I heard him say, \"Excuse me, I am   _   money for my mom. She needs to have   _   but we don't have enough money. Could you please   _   with a donation?\"\nThe lady gave him some   _   and he said, \"Thank you so much! God bless you.\" Then he walked on to the next house.\nI could see he didn't have much and I also saw he had been   _  .\n  Instead of   going to the library, I went to the bank. I told him I wanted to   _   all my savings. The lady in the bank said to me, \"But, sweetie, I thought you were going to use that money to go to   _  .\" I told her something else   came up   so she gave me the money. Then I walked to my friend's house.\nThey had only raised nine hundred and sixty-two dollars, which wasn't   _   a quarter of what they needed. I told my friend to   _   my money. When she saw it she   _   straight away it was my university money.\nThe idea of going to university had been a very   _   one for me --   _   I got accepted--but she needed the money more than I did. It was this   _   of money that could save her mother's life.\nI hope all goes well for her and her family. My love and   _   go out to them. Leo Tolstoy once said \"Nothing can make our life, or the lives of other people, more beautiful than permanent  _  .\"",
