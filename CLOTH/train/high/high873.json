    "article": "My nephew's 10!-year-!old son came for a visit one hot, July weekend. I persuaded him to  _   inside and joined him in a game. After  _   for an hour, I suggested that we relax for a while. I  fell into   my favourite recliner   to let my neck muscles relax. He had slipped out of the room and I was catching a few enjoyable   _   of peace and quiet.\n\"Look, Alice,\" he said enthusiastically as he  _  over to the chair where I was sitting. \"I found a kite. Could we go outside and  _  it?\"\nGlancing out of a nearby window, I noticed it was   _   outside. \"I'm sorry. Tripper,\" I said, sad to see his  _  eyes. \"The wind is not  _  today. The kite won't fly.\"\nThe   _  10!-year!-old replied, \"I think it's windy enough. I can get it to fly,\" he answered   _   he hurried out to the back door.\nUp and down in the yard he ran,   _  the kite attached to a small length of string. He ran back and forth, as hard as his ten-!year-!old legs would carry him, looking back   _   at the kite behind. After about ten minutes of unsuccessful determination, he came back in.\nI asked, \"How did it   _  ?\"\n\"Fine,\" he said, not wanting to admit  _  . \"I got it to fly some.\"\nAs he walked past me to return the kite to the closet shelf, I heard him say under his breath, \"I guess I'll have to wait for the   _  .\"\nAt that moment I heard another voice speak to my   _  . \"Alice, sometimes you are just like that. You want to do it your way   instead of   waiting for the wind.\"\nAnd the voice was right. We usually want to use our own efforts to   _   what we want to do. We wait for the wind only after we have done all we can and have exhausted our own   _  . We must learn how to rely on him in the first place!",
