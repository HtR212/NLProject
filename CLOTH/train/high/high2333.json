    "article": "The other evening we had a knock at the door. It was a   _   neighbor who introduced himself and his boys to us. He also invited us to a block party as a way to know the people in the   _   as well as well as celebrate the first anniversary of his two   _   sons coming to live with him.\nWe've lived here for almost six years and no one has ever come to   _   themselves. I suppose we should have   _   it on to introduce ourselves to people moving in but we haven't. In my opinion it took the initiative  of a young   _   and his adopted sons to show me how I could   _   better attention to my own community. We have many local friends but I have to   _   that I haven't usually been the one to develop the   _   in my own neighborhood.\nThis   _   reminded me of one of my favorite quotes, \"When I was a young man, I wanted to change the world. I found it was   _   to change the world, so I tried to change my nation. When I found I couldn't change the nation, I began to   concentrate on   my town. I couldn't change the town and as a(n)   _   man, I tried to change my  _  . Now, as an old man, I   _   the only thing I can change is myself and  _   I realize that if long ago I had change myself, I could have made an impact on my family and   _   on our town. The impact could have changed the nation and I could indeed have changed the   _  .\"\nFor those of us who want to make a(n)   _   in the world, it's important we remember what Bucky Fuller said, \"Think globally, but act   _  .\"For me, I'm going to make it point to meet more of my neighbors--starting now.",
