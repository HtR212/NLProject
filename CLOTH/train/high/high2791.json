    "article": "Google Inc. introduced plans in June to offer 3-D maps of major cities and other new features for its popular Google Maps and Google Earth services. New features include the ability to  _  portions of Google Maps onto phones and other  _  devices, with detailed data, so users can find their way around  _  areas even if they don't have an active Internet connection. Perhaps the most  _  new feature was the detailed three-dimensional images that Google plans to offer for major cities in coming months. Google product manager Peter Birch explained that the company is using  _  to obtain detailed images of every street and building in an area, from different  _  , which are then compiled into images that appear to show height, depth and even architectural details of buildings and streets,  as well as  landscape features such as trees. \"We are trying to create the effect that you are flying  _  the city, almost as if you were in your own personal helicopter,\" said Birch. Compiling those images  _  extensive photographing and processing of images, however.  While  Birch promised to have images  _  for several major cities in coming months, he and other Google officials did not offer a detailed timetable. Industry blogs have reported that Apple is preparing to  _  its own maps and navigation service, including 3-D images. Analysts say the  _  is part of a larger race between the two tech giants to offer services that keep users  _  and allow each company to deliver advertising or other products targeted to specific locations and other data on  _  interests.",
