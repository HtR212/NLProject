I remember him as someone nice and   _  . When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving   _  , he was planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life's   _   was to make it a forest.\nBut he   _  watered his new trees. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants would   _   them, and that   _   you water them, each successive    _   of trees will grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things   _   for them.\nHe'd planted an oak, and instead of watering it every morning, he'd   _   it with a rolled-up newspaper. I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to cause the tree's   _  . Dr.Gibbs passed away a couple of years ago.   Now and again  , I walk by his house and look at the trees that I watched him plant some 25 years ago. They are big and   _   now. Sufferings seemed to   _   them in ways ease and   _   never could.\n    Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies, the rising and falling of life within. I often pray for them. Mostly I pray that their lives will be  _  . But lately I've been thinking that it's time to   _   my prayer, because life is   _  , whether we want it to be or not. Too many times we pray for ease, but that's what we seldom   _  . What we need to do is to pray for roots that reach deep into the earthe, so when the rains fall and the winds blow, we won't be  _  .",
