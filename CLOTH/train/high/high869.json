    "article": "In a small open courtyard, outside a school building, there were flowers here and there. In the sunshine,a  _  was lying on the grass,reading a book with  _  concentration. Near her,another child was carefully watering the flowers, while a third was  _  with his back against a tree and had a  _  on his knees. He appeared to be drawing or writing something on it. He was  _  in his task, like the first child.  _  the building, there were pleasant carpeted areas. Many children were busy with their tasks in a variety of  _  while teachers wandered among them, talking to them,  smiling at  them, and encouraging their efforts.  _  I watched this scene on a morning in May years ago, it  _  to me that a visitor here would  _  have thought he had entered a formal school. He would have been even more  _  if he had been told that the children he was  _  came from different kinds of academic levels. That  _  has been staying with me ever since. I have been  _  about some problems. Why in many schools are our children  _  asked to acquire skills in a way  _  from a real-life context ? Why does a  _  school child so often become a defeated school failure? Developmental psychologist Margaret Donald once said, \"  _  of the intellectual framework on which we  _  our teaching is misleading.\" In my opinion, a child learns everything in human situation. And if every child could learn in the same way as the children in the school I visited, they would develop better.",
