After years of hard work, I am living proof that dreams can come true.\nWhen I was born, my parents immediately noticed something  _  and the doctor said I couldn't skate. I, however,  insisted on  trying skating in an ice rink  , where local skaters  _  perform ice shows. I started taking group skating lessons, and performing on ice came naturally, but I have always been  _  to speak in group settings. One thing I've never been afraid of is  _  , though. I get nervous, but never  _  . For me, skating has been about being my personal best  rather than  beating others on the ice. 1 progressed through various  _  rapidly and gave my first ice performance at seven. Soon I started winning local and regional competitions. That's  _  being on the ice has always been the one place where I can  _  express my own emotions. The ice is like home.\nWhen I was nine years old I began training  _  . I would wake up at four o'clock in the morning six days a week and skate for five hours. Then I'd go to school. Since  _  has always been important in my family, I had no  _  but to find creative ways to fit in school studies throughout my  49  career.\nAfter graduating from high school, I moved to Canada and set out to train full-time to give my dreams a chance at reality. In 1992 I went to compete in the Olympic Games.  _  , not my coach or even my family, ever talked to me about winning a gold medal. In fact, I wouldn't even  _  myself to think about it. I thought that would disturb me.  _  , I went with the attitude that I wanted to enjoy the Olympic spirit.  _  the expectation of all the people, I won the gold medal and words couldn't describe the overwhelming mixture of emotions I felt. Then I truly understood what  _  most in achieving a dream is nor to  _  it when you 1ace difficulties, but strive to make it come true.",
