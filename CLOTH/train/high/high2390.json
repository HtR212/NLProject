    "article": "I agree with the saying that some people \"see old memories as a chance to deal with the past and unite past and present.\" Many people are so  _  by things that happened in their past that they are not able to focus on the  _  . For example, in the book Ceremony, the main character, Tayo, cannot concentrate on the present because he can't forget his troubled childhood and  _  continues to relive things that happened during that time. However, past memories can help people to  _  in the present. A  _  example of people learning from the past would be the Marshall Plan. After the  _  of World War II there were many war-torn countries around the world in need of  _  assistance to help rebuild their countries, and the United States would have to be the one to  _  that assistance. Many American politicians thought it was  _  for the US government to spend money abroad on countries that would not be able to repay it for a long time. However, George Marshall, a former US general, remembered how the exact same  _  of \"why should we spend money on war-torn nations that really owe us reparations ?\" had been used after World War I towards Germany. The  _  of assistance towards Germany after World War I had caused a gigantic economic depression in Germany that had made the Mark (German money) virtually  _  . The German people became so desperate that they started  _  an extreme German nationalist named Adolf Hitler, who eventually started World War II. Marshall knew that if the US did not  _  war-torn Germany and, especially, Japan, we could  _  have a World War III on our hands.",
