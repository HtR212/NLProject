    "article": "Russ was a lovable kid with a variety of communication challenges---a speech impediment  , dyslexia  , and auditory  problems.   _  today he is walking confidently, standing tall to make an acceptance  _  for having been chosen one of the \"Outstanding Young Citizens\" in Ocean County,\nNew Jersey  because of  his remarkable volunteer service in the town of Toms\nRiver.\n    As I listened, I closed my eyes. I found myself   _  those memorable moments. My mind was full of warm\nimages of Russ as a loving, caring youth, a gentle soul,  facing up to  his challenges. And now, as he stood at the platform, I knew his\nheart  _  be racing. As Russ continued to speak, I thought about the\nfateful day when he was diagnosed with all those impairments  and how   _  his tutors would be if they could see him today. Here he was at twenty-nine,\nbeing honored for ten years of service as a volunteer  _  .Russ was  _  for organizing clothing for the homeless, teaching preschool children about\nfire safety, and for playing Santa Claus for very sick children by driving up\nin a fire truck.\n    Russ thanked his parents for providing him with dignity and for teaching him about morals. Then, pausing for a few seconds, he   _  us by surprise\nby touching lovingly on the  _  of his nephew, Austin. Austin was just three years old when he died from an incurable disease. At that moment, I\nhad to close my eyes again  _  a different set of tears ran down my\ncheeks. A silence  fell over  the room as Russ owed his volunteer award to Austin. He  _  his address by lifting the audience up with these words, \"Austin taught me how to love.\"\n    I have never thought of this day.   _  ,\nno one had ever thought that Russ would make  _  as the star of the\nfootball team, and he had never been voted \"most likely to succeed,\" but he  _  to be a true \"star\" in his community. Russ became a man of strong character  _  his unselfish service to others. With so many impairments, Russ now\nsees and acts  _  with his heart. His words and deeds inspire\neveryone who knows him. It is Russ, our son, who has shown us what  _  is.",
