    "article": "Mondays are usually pretty busy for me. On one of these  _  Mondays, I got ready to go to work thinking about all the things I had to  _  on that day and walked down to get to my car scolding myself for being late to work, but  _  the car was nowhere to be found. I  _  right across my apartment the previous night but it wasn't there that morning. This was at 8:00 am in the morning. I made  _  to all the towing places, police stations all the time thinking that it was towed by  _  . By around 10:00 am, I couldn't find it anywhere and the policemen decided that it was  _  stolen. After filing a report with them, I finally got to work thinking how my day was completely  messed up  . Later in the day I went to pick up a rental car at an enterprise  _  to realize that my license was missing too along with my car. I told the enterprise guy the whole  _  and he was so sorry for me that he  _  to take me to the nearest DMV and get a duplicate  _  . I was totally surprised. I didn't know why this complete stranger would want to  _  some time off his day to help me . He actually took me to DMV, got a duplicate and then  _  me a car. I was  _  the whole day because of the continuous events that happened to me but somehow this simple act of kindness from a  _  stranger made it all worth it. It cheered me up and made me forget all the misfortunes of the day. I was so  _  by this kind act that the next day I made sure someone else got a similar  _  . I took some smiley shaped chocolates and  _  them on some of my colleague's desks. This is still a lot  _  out there in the world. We just need to take the time to discover it.",
