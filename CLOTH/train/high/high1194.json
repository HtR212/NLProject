    "article": "Growing up in Kenya was amazing because I learned so much, though the poverty and lack of resources were sometimes frustrating. I knew I didn't have much,   _  I was happy.\nThere was only one thing I wasn't happy with:   _  . I wanted to go to high school and university. I had the  _  , the will and the grades, but I didn't have the  _  .\nEven basic things like food, water and shelter weren't  _  available.\nYoung people in poverty have little or no   _  to\nhigh schools and universities. Where I lived, it was challenging  unless  someone helped.\nWhen I left primary school, I was in the same situation as many other   _  disadvantaged youth.  _  , during that year, a charitable high school for girls, Starehe Girls\nCentre, was founded and I received a  _  . Today, I am\non record as being the first student to be  _  to\nthis school.\nIn 2006, my school joined The Global Give Back Circle, a not-for-profit organization for disadvantaged girls to complete their education and gain employable   _  . After graduating from high\nschool, I was given access to a nine-month IT  _  . In\naddition, its give-back attitude had taught us to not only  care about  ourselves but other people.\nWith this in mind, 10 of us created a website called \"Hey Sister, Get Clued-Up\". Through this educational website,   aimed at  networking\n10,000 African girls worldwide, all Sisters  _  to\nsending information to their villages. This can be to promote financial\nfreedom, advance information  related to  health issues\nand provide knowledge about social networking behavior.\n\"Hey Sister, Get Clued-Up\" is only   _  to those girls who can access the\nInternet, which highlights   the huge challenge in   _  the divide between the haves and have-nots. But our plan is that\nthese girls will spread  _  they learn to other\ngirls through the \"power of their voice\".",
