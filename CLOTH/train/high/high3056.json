    "article": "Two years ago I was working at a girls' summer camp -- for girls who had never been given a chance to go to school. It was a rather  _  summer until Amy arrived.\nAmy was about seven. She had been  _  in the closet   for months when she was five by her mother, who had to  _  during the day. When a neighbor discovered Amy's  _  , she reported it. Amy was taken  _  and put into a foster   home. Since then, Amy hadn't spoken at all -- the most noticeable among all the  _  .\nThen I started to notice  _  else about Amy. After lunch most of the kids got  _  from their parents, but none came for Amy.\nAt  _  I used to sit on a bench at beach,  _  and looking over the lake. As I approached the benches one night, I saw Amy  _  there.\n\"Hey, Amy,\" I said, sitting  _  to her. \"You see that light there, on the other  _  of water? I like looking at that light. For me it's like my dream. One  _  I'm going to do something important with my life.\"\nThe next day when the  _  was handed out, Amy's name was  _  out. She went up to get the letter. I went over and asked, \"Hey, Amy, what's your secret?\"\nShe didn't  _  . She looked at the letter, a picture of a lake with a big  _  shining on the other side of it. She looked at me, and put the  _  over her heart.\nOn the last day of the camp, she gave me a big hug good bye.  _  she had dream of her own. I hope so.",
