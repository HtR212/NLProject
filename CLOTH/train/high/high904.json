    "article": "Fill Her Tank First The summer of 1975 I'd just graduated from college in Southern California and received a 1968 Ford Capri for a graduation present. I had my first job, in Los Angeles. One Sunday night,  _  myself a very independent grown-up, I left my uncle's place in South Laguna after a visit, without  _  to him that I had less than an  _  of a tank of gas and no cash to buy  _  on the way to L.A. I pulled onto the Pacific Coast Highway and watched the needle  _  as I headed north. When I started running on fumes, I pulled into a  gas station  . There was no self-service  at that time  ; there were no credit cards, no ATMs. I begged the guy at the station. I  _  write him a check for gas, I said, or I could sleep in my car and try to  _  to a town with a bank the next morning. As he was informing me that I could sleep in my car but he'd have me  _  , a station wagon  pulled up  to the next pump. The driver--- a thin, plain, middle-aged guy---overheard the tail end of my  _  request. As the attendant went to serve him, he nodded at me. \"  Fill  her tank first,\" he said. \"Really?\" I said. Hope  _  . \"Oh, thank you. Thank you. But please. I just need two dollars'  _  . I just need to go home.\" \"Fill it,\" he  _  to the attendant. Then to me, \"You will do the same one day, for someone else.\" I keep looking for that unlucky young person,  _  to save her night on the road. Meanwhile, in case she never  _  up, I try for other acts of random kindness. That  _  driver is always at the pump a few feet away,  _  the attendant to fill mine first.",
