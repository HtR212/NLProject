    "article": "Our character,   _  , is a combination of our habits. \"Sow a thought, harvest an action; sow an action, harvest a habit; sow a habit, harvest a character; sow a character, harvest a  _  ,\" the saying goes.\nHabits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent, often unconscious     _   , they constantly, daily express our character and produce our effectiveness or ineffectiveness.\nAs Horace Mann, the great educator, once   _   it, \"Habits are like a rope. We weave a string of it every day and soon it cannot be broken.\" I personally do not agree with the last part of his   _  . I know habits can be learned and unlearned. But I also know it isn't a(an)   _  fix. It involves a   _  and a faithful commitment.\nThose of us who watched the lunar voyage of Apollo II were quite amazed as we saw the first men walk on the moon and return to earth.   _  to get there, those astronauts obviously had to break out of the huge gravity pull of the earth.   _  energy was spent in the first few minutes of 50 _ in the first few miles of travel, than was used over the next several days to travel half a million miles.\nHabits,   _  ,have huge gravity pull more than most people realize or would   _  . Breaking deeply   _  habits such as delay, hesitation, impatience, criticalness, or selfishness that go against basic principles of human effectiveness   calls for  more than a little willpower and a few minor changes in our lives. \"Lift off\" 55 _ a great effort, but once we break out of the gravity pull, our freedom 56 takes on a whole new dimension.\n  As with  any natural force, gravity can work   _  us or against us. The gravity pull of some of our habits may   _  be keeping us from going where we want to go. But it is also gravity that pull that keeps our world together, that keeps the planets in their orbits and our universe in order. It is a powerful force, and if we use it effectively, we can use the gravity pull of habit to create the cooperation and   _  necessary to establish effectiveness in our lives.",
