    "article": "Over a hundred years ago, in a Scottish seaside inn, a group of fisherman were relaxing after a long day  at sea  .As a serving maid was walking  _  the fishermen's table with a pot of tea, one of the men made a sweeping   _  to describe the size of the fish he had caught. His hand had a collision with the teapot and sent it  _  against the whitewashed wall, where its contents left a(n)  _  brown spot. Standing nearby ,the innkeeper surveyed the damage . \"That stain will never come off ,\"he said in discomfort. \"The whole wall will have to be  _  .\"\n   \"Perhaps not.\" All eyes   turned to  the stranger who had just spoken. \"What do you mean ?\"asked the innkeeper. \"Let me work with the  _  ,\"said the stranger, standing up from his table in the corner. \"If my work  _  your approval, you won't need to repaint the wall.\"\nThe stranger   made up  a box and went to the wall. Opening the box, he withdrew pencils,  _  ,\nand various colours. He began to draw lines around the stain and fill it in here and there with different color1s.  _  a picture began to appear. The stain of   _  had been turned into the picture of a deer with a magnificent pair of antlers. At the bottom of the picture, the man  _  his name. Then he paid for his  _  and left.\nThe innkeeper was   _  when he examined the wall. \"Do you know who that man was?\" he said in amazement . \"The signature   _  'E.H.Landseer!'\" Indeed, they had been visited by the   _  painter of wild life ,Sir Edwin Landseer. God wants to take the stains and disappointments of our live and not  _  erase them, but rather turn them into a thing of  _  .",
