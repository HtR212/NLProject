    "article": "In winter, I often walk in a nearby park during lunch time. The park is quiet, as   few   people have the time to enjoy the winter sun on a weekday. The two people that are often seen are a middle-aged father and his little daughter   _   her school uniform. The father looks like he has all the time in the world----he   _   to hurry along the jogging path; instead he matches his pace with   _   of the little girl. Sometimes they are lying   _   in the sun, laughing and chatting.\nThe man certainly doesn't look   _  . What sort of job can he have that gives him the flexibility to walk in the park in the middle of the day?\nAnd today, we   _   sat on the rocks and had a little chat. \"You   _   enjoy the park very much to come here so often,\" I said. The father nodded. \"How\" I asked curiously, \"do you   _   to leave your office to be with your daughter every day?\"\nThe story that the father, Satyendra Dugbey, told me showed me how, if we   _   under the surface, even ordinary people's life can be quite   _  .\n\"I used to be no different from any of those thousands of office workers   _   to work every day,\" he began. His wife and he were well   _   but rarely managed time off for leisure.\nEverything changed after an accident   in which   Dugbey was hit by a car. As he lay in hospital, terrifying thoughts   came into   his mind. \"How would my daughter, then only four, remember me if I died that day?\" \"Would my daughter have   _   of being with her father?\"\nThe moment he recovered and went back to work, Dugbey took time off at lunch,   picked up   her daughter from school which was just next door to his working place, and took her to the park.\nIt was actually a very small change he'd made, he said, but it amazed him every day to see the difference it   _   to his life. \"It brings me so much   _   that I can't believe why others haven't thought of doing the same thing.\" he said simply.\nI got up to continue my   _   walk, unexpectedly happy after his story.",
