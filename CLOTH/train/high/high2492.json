There was one thing    _   in his life. In 41 years, his father never said to him that he was   _   of him, loved him and believed in him. These words were the only thing Randy ever   _  from his father but in 41 years Randy never got any of them.\nFor three years while Randy was    _    the cancer, every time I saw him, I  _   him a bear hug and told him how much I    _   him. Randy has been gone for twenty years. I miss him and his father also misses him,   _   I don't have to live with regret that I never told Randy what he   _   to me. His father does. I'm convinced  that if his father had one  _  , he would choose to be given a chance to tell his son how much he loved him.  _   he'll never get that chance. It is too   _   for him. He will live the rest of his life with that   _  .\nIt may still not be too late for you. Is there anyone in your  _   who would love to or needs to have some special words of love, encouragement or   _  from you? Is there anyone who deserves and wants to  _  the words and doesn't want to \"just intuitively   know\" how you feel? Life is too    _  , leaving many words not spoken and many deeds not done.  _  ,people don't know how you feel until you tell them how you feel. I'm sure there must be someone you can call, visit or write to. Don't wait until it is too late.  _  it now.",
