    "article": "Father's Day is a fairly new celebration in the British calendar compared with Mother's Day, which has been a very popular and well celebrated festival in the UK for a very long time.\nFather's Day was first celebrated by Americans  _  it was inspired by the actions of a man named William Smart.He was a veteran of the US Civil War and his wife  _  away giving birth to their sixth child.He  _  six children alone without remarrying, which was undoubtedly  _  back in those days.\nHis daughter, Sonora Dodd,  _  when she was an adult what her father had sacrificed for his  _  .It was in the early 1900s and she was actually  at church  one day, listening to a sermon on  Mother's Day  .She thought there should  also  be a Father's Day celebration.\nAnd so the  _  was born, on the third Sunday every June, close to the anniversary of Sonora's father's death.Britain took the idea of Father's Day from the American celebration and it has been celebrated  _  since the 1970s.\nFather's Day is never quite such a big commercial event  _  Mother' s Day is, probably because it hasn't been in  _  for so long.But what do British people do for Father's Day? Well, most people would buy their fathers a card.The card would probably have nice message in it  _  what a great Dad their father is.Some people do buy presents as well.\n  _  gifts for Dads are probably ties, chocolates or socks because there are things that Dads can  _  use even if they don't want them.In the run-up to Father's Day, or indeed Mother's Day, there will be advertisements on TV giving  _  ideas of CDs or gadgets  we can buy.Card shops will be full of mugs or pens and similar goods with \" World's Greatest Dad\"  _  on them.\nSome families  _  do things together to celebrate Father's Day like going for a meal.As a special treat, British people might give their Dad a bit of a rest,  _  him a cup of tea, or even wash his car and mow the lawn to make him feel really appreciate.",
