We were all a little surprised by the   _  . It's not that Ben is   _  , or a bad cook, but he never spends more than he has to. Money has been hard earned and so should be spent   _  . So why was he inviting us round for a   _  ?\nBen greeted us at the door with a grin , and as we   _  , a laid table was waiting for us. He was still smiling in a strange way. \"Nothing but the best for my friends!\" said Ben. We sat down and looked   _   at each other--what was he up to?\nBen returned with four bowls of soup. It was a mixture of carrots, potatoes and tomatoes. The next   _   was just another mixture of things. There was some bread too, but it was a little stale .\n\"Did you follow a set of   _   that tells you how to cook this,\" asked Marina, \"or did you just make it up yourself?\" Ben put his fork down. \"What I cooked depended on what I could   _  .\" Marina was surprised. \"  _   you can find anything in British supermarkets these days.\" \"But there is less choice   _   supermarkets,\" he replied.\nWe all   _   at him in amazement. \"What do you mean by outside supermarkets?\" asked Alistair.\nSeeing that we had all   _   the food, Ben decided that it was time to tell the   _  . He had read recently that a lot of   _   was thrown away by supermarkets every day, because they only want to sell   _   food. So Ben found those vegetables and bread inside his local supermarket bins.\nWe were all   _   . Ben said he can afford not to eat   _   food so he would not do this regularly. However, he also said, \"There are many poor people who   _   the food, and the amount of food thrown away is enough to feed millions of people.\"",
