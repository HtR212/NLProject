I  _  Salome Bey,telling her I was from Essence magazine,and that I wanted to meet her to talk about her career.She  _  and told me to come to her studio next Tuesday.When I hung up,I was scared out of my mind.I  _  I was lying.I was not a writer at all and hadn't even written a grocery list. I interviewed Salome Bey the next Tuesday.I sat there  _  ,taking notes and asking questions that all began with,\"Can you tell me...\" I soon realized that  _  Salome Bey was one thing,but writing a story for a national magazine was just impossible.The  _  was almost unbearable .I struggled for days  _  draft after draft.Finally I put my manuscript into a large envelope and dropped it into a mailbox. It didn't take long.My manuscript  _  .How stupid of me!I thought.How could I  _  in a world of professional writers?Knowing I couldn't  _  the rejection letter,I threw the unopened envelope into a drawer. Five years later,I was moving to California.While  _  my apartment,I came across the unopened envelope.This time I opened it and  _  the editor's letter in disbelief: Dear Ms Profit, Your story on Salome Bey is fantastic.Yet we need some  _  materials.Please add those and return the article immediately.We would like to  _  your story soon. Shocked,it took me a long time to  _  .Fear of rejection cost me dearly.I lost at least five hundred dollars and having my article appear in a major magazine.More importantly,I lost years of  _  writing.Today,I have become a fulltime writer.Looking back on this  _  ,I learned a very important lesson:You can't  _  to doubt yourself.",
