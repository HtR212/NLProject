When someone tells you something that is  _  , but leaves out important information that should be  _  , he can create a false impression. For example, someone might say, \"I just  _  a hundred dollars on the lottery. It was great. I took that dollar ticket back to the store and  _  it in for one hundred dollars!\" This guy is a winner,  _  ? Maybe, maybe not. We then discover that he bought two hundred  _  , and only one was a winner. He's really a big  _  ! He didn't say anything that was  _  , but he deliberately left out some important  _  . That's called a half-truth. Half-truths are not technically  _  , but they are just as not  _  . Untrustworthy candidates in  _  campaigns often use this tactic . Let's say that during Governor Smith's last term, the state lost one million jobs and  _  three million jobs. Then she  _  another term. One of her opponents runs an ad  _  , \"During Governor Smith's term, the state lost one million jobs!\"That's true.  _  , an honest statement would have been, \"During Governor Smith's term, the state had a net gain of  _  million jobs. \" Advertisers will sometimes use half-truths. It's  _  the law to make false claims so they try to mislead you with the  _  . An ad might boast, \"Nine out of ten doctors recommend Yucky Pills to cure nose pimples. \"It  _  to mention that they only asked ten doctors and nine of them work for the Yucky Corporation. This kind of deception happens too often. It's a sad fact of life: Lies are lies, and sometimes the truth can lie as well.",
