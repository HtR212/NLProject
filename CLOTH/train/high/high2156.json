I pick it up and   _  the routine, \"Teen Lifeline, this is Amber.\" About 45 minutes later I\nhang up, feeling pleased because I've helped another teen.\nVolunteering at Teen Lifeline has helped me realize how to deal with my\nown  _  and help others.\n\"My mom is always fighting with me. I want to run away.\"\nSome teens feel their  _  is a prison,\nrather than a place of shelter and safety. They feel parents are only there to\nmake their lives  _  . We try to help the\nteens realize the danger they could be in  _  giving\nthem advice. All we can do is to ask questions. We also try to find\nout where the teens would go and how they would survive. We give them a\nphone number if they  _  don't want\nto live in their \"prison\".\n\"I don't want to   _  any more\" is something we hear, and suicide   calls are some of the hardest to   deal with  . We try to discover why they want to take their lives and\nhow serious they are by asking them to rate it on a scale of one to\nten. One means they are  _  suicide\nbut haven't decided how, and ten means they are always thinking about it and\nhave a  _  . We ask them to make a\npromise that they will not hurt themselves. And sometimes we ask for their\ntelephone numbers  so that  we can call back to\nmake sure that they are okay.\nAlthough many calls are about  ly   _  problems, volunteering at Teen Lifeline has helped me\nrealize I'm not the  _  person with\nproblems, and has taught me how to  _  with\nmy heart. I have made a  _  and saved\nmany lives -- possibly even my own, too.",
