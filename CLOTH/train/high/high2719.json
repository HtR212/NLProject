    "article": "Finding meaning\nThis is a part of Debra Jarvis' speech at TED in 2014, which described what she learned when she was a cancer patient.\nIn 2005, it was at a big cancer center where I was working   _   I received the news that my mother had breast cancer. And then five days later, I received the news that I had breast cancer. My mother and I can be competitive, but I was really not trying to   _   with her on this one.\nI learned a lot being a patient, and one of the surprising things was that only a small part of the cancer experience is about   _  . Most of it is about feelings and faith, losing and   _   your identity, and discovering   _   you never even knew you had. It's about realizing that the most important things in life are not things at all,   _   relationships. It's about laughing in the   _   of uncertainty and learning that the way to get out of almost anything is to say: \"I   _   cancer.\"\nSo the other thing I   _   was that I don't have to   take on   \"cancer survivor\" as my identity. Sometimes, it feels like people are too crazy   _   it and they start telling us how we're going to feel.\nAbout a week after my operation, we had a houseguest. So at dinner that night, our houseguest said: \"You know, Deb, now you're really going to learn what's   _  . Yes, you are going to make some big changes in your life, and now you're going to start   _   about your death. Yep, this cancer is your wake-up call.\" Now, these are golden   _   coming from someone who is speaking about their own experience, but when someone is telling you how you are going to feel, it doesn't   make sense  . After my treatment, it just felt like everyone was telling me what my   _   was going to mean.\nIt was at that point where I felt like, oh my God, this is just   _   over my life. And that's when I told myself: Take charge of your experience. Don't let it   _   you. We all know that the way to deal with this unpleasant experience, with loss, with any life-changing experience, is to find   _  . But here's the thing: No one can tell us what our experience means. We have to   _   what it means.",
