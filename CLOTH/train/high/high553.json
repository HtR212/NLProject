Children have panda toys and beautiful cards with pictures of lovely   _  in them. They often visit the giant pandas in the zoo on   _   holidays and have a good time there. However, scientists are worried about the   _   of giant pandas. They know only about 1,000 giant pandas remain   _   today. They think the giant pandas will die out in 30 years if the present conditions are not   _   .\nIt is reported that the giant pandas have a very   _   birthrate. About 115 pandas live in the zoo and research centers mainly in China, but during the past 10 years they   _   only   _   pandas that are still alive. Survival rate for giant pandas in the wild are probably the same or lower.\nThere are several reasons for the low   _  . The main reason is   _   male pandas can mate  with females in a very   _   season--- only a few days a year. When they do have babies, females often produce two pandas, but the mother is usually not able to care for   _   of them. The newborn pandas   _   only a few kilograms each. They are too weak to live without special care. In the zoo, scientists can help the mothers   _   for the young pandas, but those living in the wild do not get enough   _  . It is very difficult for mother pandas to bring up their young pandas.\nConditions for the giant pandas have been worse in recent years. Pandas in China continue to   _   in number. We know pandas live on bamboos. But sometimes all the bamboos in one area die. The pandas there have   _   to eat and die of hunger.\nGiant pandas now live in 13 separate   _   areas in China. Several years ago the Chinese government and the International Wildlife Organization agreed   _   a project of protecting giant pandas in the wild. We hope it could be useful.",
