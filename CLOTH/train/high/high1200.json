    "article": "The only thing that troubled me more than the pain in my back that morning was my worries about money. I'd been excited to visit my sister--Therese, but all I could think about was how I'd hurt my back and had to  _  down my hours at work. Even with my savings, I wasn't sure I'd have enough to cover the bills. \"Are you OK?\" Therese asked. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Just wish I could stop worrying about  _  .\" \"Why don't we make Mom's cake?\" she said. \"Mom  _  to make this kind of cake for all of us. It will  _  you up.\" It wasn't easy being a single mom, raising eight of us kids with  _  money, but that couldn't bring Mom down. She got that spirit from our grandmother, who was never  _  about the hardships(,). Also, Mom was good at  _  use of food. She always found a way to include a special treat on birthday or Christmas--a tasty cake with  _  eggs, milk or butter.  _  how we'd all run around the living room singing,'eggless, milkless, butterless cake'?\" Therese asked, laughing. \"Those were good times,\" I said. We didn't have money,  _  we knew how to have  _  together. Thinking about the eight of us gathered around the kitchen table waiting for Mom to cut the cake  _  my worries. Mom would make the cake extra  _  for Christmas--a coin was put into the cake. \"Whoever finds the  _  in their cake can keep it and they won't have to do housework for a week.\"she would say. My siblings and I are now separated from each other, but the cake still  _  \"Cake's done,\" Therese said. I pulled it out of the oven , then called everyone in. We gathered around the kitchen table,  _  like old times. \"Feeling any  _  ?\" Therese asked. \"Yeah,\" I said. I looked at the  _  around the table, reminded once again that whatever hardships come my way I can do more than just get through them. I can find  _  in my life, even in a simple cake, and share it  _  the ones I love.",
