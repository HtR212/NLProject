    "article": "One day, Raul was miles away from the small ranch house in a large valley. Everything seemed to be all right, yet he felt strange and somewhat uneasy. The wind had picked up, and angry, dark clouds  _  across the sky. He could smell the rain coming. And it did.  _  , the lightning flashed through the clouds, nearly  _  Raul. The thunder was so loud that he buried his head in his hands and rubbed his eyes. Then he heard it -- hoof beats . He  looked up  . There before him stood a tall, white horse. An old man stared down at him from its back. \"Wh-wh-who are y-y-you?\" asked Raul. \"Oh, my name is Gray Cloud,\" the old man answered  _  , \"come with me.\" Raul followed on with his horse. A  _  feeling came over him. All  _  them the rain was pouring down,  _  not a drop fell on them. They seemed to be  _  back toward Raul's home. Raul lost track of time. Then all at once, he found  _  at the ranch gate. The old man turned his horse, waved his hand, and smiled. Lightning flashed again. The old man and his horse were  _  . Raul's father ran out across the yard to  _  him. \"We have been  _  about you. Are you okay? Hurry. Let's get in out of the  _  .\" \"Wait,\" said Raul. \"Have you ever heard of an old man called Gray Cloud?\" \"Can't say I ... wait. I believe my great-grandfather used to tell stories about a man called Gray Cloud. He died a long time ago. They all say he was  _  by lightning during a terrible thunderstorm. Why do you ask?\" At this, Raul was really more shocked than puzzled.",
