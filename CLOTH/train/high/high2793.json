A recent university study has shown that, actually, we're pretty   _  -- especially when we're at home.\nResearchers in Germany   _   people at home and asked them to toss   a coin.

Because they were on the phone, they knew there was no   _   of getting caught if they lied.\nAnd yet people told the   _  . Over hundreds of tosses a coin will land tails-up about 50% of the time. In this   _   over half the people asked (55.6%) said that the coin landed heads-up, which meant they would receive nothing.\nPrevious studies had found that people were more   _  . In those laboratory studies, 75% of people reported a   _   coin and asked for a reward. So the research team thinks it's being in our own homes which makes us play fair, although it's not yet clear why.\nIn fact both types of study show people are surprisingly   _  .
