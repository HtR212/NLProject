    "article": "I walked into the grocery store not particularly interested in buying something. The sorrow of  _  my husband of 37 years was still too painful. And this grocery store held so many sweet  _  . Bob often came with me and almost every time he'd  _  to go off and look for something special. I'd always see him walking down the walkway  _  the three yellow roses in his hands. Bob knew I loved yellow roses. With a heart  _  with pain, I came to the meat shelf, I searched for the  _  small steak and remembered how Bob had loved his steak. Suddenly a woman came beside me. She was in a soft green dress. I  _  as she picked up a large pack of T-bones,  _  them in her basket, hesitated, and then put them back. She saw me watching her and she smiled. \"My husband loves T-bones, but  _  , at these prices, I don't know.\" \"My husband passed away eight days ago,\" I told her. \"Buy him the steaks. And value every  _  you have together.\" She smiled and I saw the feeling in her  _  as she placed the package in her basket and  _  away. I turned and pushed my cart forward too. Several minutes later I saw first the green suit and then  _  the pretty lady coming to me. In her arms she carried something. On her face was the  _  smile I had ever seen. As she came closer, I saw what she held and  _  welled down. \"These are for you, \" she said and placed three beautiful yellow roses in my arms. She placed a gentle kiss on my cheek, then smiled again. I wanted to tell her what the roses  _  , but still unable to speak. I watched as she walked away as tears clouded my  _  . I looked down at the beautiful roses and found it almost  _  . How did she know? Suddenly the  _  seemed so clear. I wasn't alone. \"Oh, Bob, you haven't  _  me, have you?\" I whispered, with tears in my eyes. He was still with me, and she was his angel.",
