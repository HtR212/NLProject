    "article": "In my childhood, I envied my classmates very much as my absence from school was not allowed due to my strict parents. I had to be   _   in order to stay home. My parents   _   to say that they were leading me to have a   _   work ethic  . Not until last week did I see the   _   .\nI was on a bus, and behind was a man who was   _   to his friend about his life. His dream was to become a director but he wouldn't continue to   _   it because he had no   _   if he could make enough money. And he didn't want to waste   _   because it probably would take months or years to   _   it big. Then he admitted to thinking about becoming a(n)   _   because he thought he could   _   make six figures within one year. His friend agreed because as he put it, \"I have no   _   to work long hours and not make much money. Taking pictures is good because you can make big money and only work short hours.\"\nMany people these days don't   _   that when things seem to happen immediately, it is only because a lot of   _   , determination and time have gone into it. Someone once told me that you may know   _   someone is an expert in his given field by how easy he makes it look. The   _   it looks, the more hours go into it.\nThere is no   _   for laziness. In the television show Fame, the dance teacher told her students, \"If you want fame, fame   _   and here's how you start paying for it, in sweat.\" Every time I watch that show, my dad would repeat how   _   she was because in order to   _   you have to work hard. He would go on and on about how bad it is to be lazy.",
