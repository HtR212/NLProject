    "article": "My friend BJ Gallagher once worked as a training manager for a large newspaper, which was more than a hundred years old. The company's past  _  had blinded the authorities to the need for change, and they  _  new ideas and would say \"This is the way we've always done it.\". As the years went by, BJ grew more and more  _  with their short-sightedness. Finally, she left the company. But she found that she hadn't left her  _  behind when she resigned. She carried it with her, like \"rocks in the stomach\". \"I finally decided to  _  about my experiences and my feelings. I  _  it would be a good mental health  _  . I wanted to be rid of that company and those people, once and for all. So I wrote and wrote. It wasn't just a story that poured out -- it was a whole  _  ! My resentment  _  my writing. The whole world would know how  _  they were!\" \"What  _  when the book came out?\" I asked BJ. \"Not much,\" she replied, \"The newspaper kept doing what it had  _  done. My feelings didn't  _  them one bit, but it took me several more years to finally  get over  my negative emotions. Finally, the time came when I decided to make amends for the angry things I had said about the company. I  _  my former boss to dinner and made my  _  . I told him I was sorry for being so resentful. It was a great healing process for me.\" \"What was the  _  outcome?\" I asked her. \"Gratitude,\" she replied, \"Not only wasn't I resentful any more, but I was grateful to the company. If I hadn't had those  _  experiences, I never would have written a book. And the book became hugely successful -- now  _  in 21 languages. In short, my resentment gave way to gratitude.\" She smiled, \"I owe them a debt of thanks for giving me such a great tale to tell.\" Trading resentments for gratitude isn't always easy. But it's worth it,  _  gratitude is a far happier feeling than resentment.",
