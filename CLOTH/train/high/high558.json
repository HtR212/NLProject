    "article": "When my father died, one of the tasks that fell to me was to sort through and decide which objects to save and which to throw away. Now I look at the  _  of my life as if I were dead,  _  what my children will do with the human skull that  _  on the bookcase next to my desk. I couldn't  _  them if they threw it out. They've been wanting to do that for some years,  _  will they know how much can be learned from  _  with a skull? And what about my books?  _  they can find some place in their  _  for ten thousand books. However, I know they will look at the white, plastic head of a horse on my desk and  _  it into a Glad trash bag without any  _  , never knowing that it is the only place  _  from the first chess set I owned. How many boxes of mine will my children  _  ? Can I trust my children with my  _  ? Every object of our lives is a  _  , and emotion swirls around it like fog, hiding and  _  a tiny truth of the heart. I look at these objects that are mine and know, too, that they are  _  of how alone I am, how alone each of us is,  _  no one knows what any object means except he or she who  _  it. I have the memory of taking it home  _  one of my newly-born children from the hospital; only I have the memory of what it looked like when I lived in that apartment and where it sat in that house. I look at the objects that are mine, and the memories are  _  and permeated with love. I look at the objects that are mine and know that I'm going to miss me very much.",
