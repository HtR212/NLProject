    "article": "There is a beautiful story about a child playing with a vase his mother had left on the table for a few moments. When the mother turned  _  the sound of her son's crying she saw that his  _  was in the vase and was apparently stuck. She  _  to help him and pulled and pulled until the child cried out  in pain  . But the hand was stuck fast . How would they get it out? The father suggested  _  the vase but it was quite valuable and the child's hand might be cut in the  _  . Yet he knew that if all else  _  there would be no other alternative. So he said to the boy, \"Now, let's make one more  _  . Open your hand and stretch your  _  out straight, as I'm doing, and then pull!\" \"  _  Dad,\" said the boy, \"if I do that I'll  _  my penny!\" The boy had had a coin in his hand  all the time  and was holding it  _  in his little fist . And he wasn't  _  to open his hand and lose it. But  _  he opened his hand it came out of the vase easily. The father said to the boy, \"What are you holding onto so tightly as to hinder your walk with God? That vase can be  _  to the entrance to the Kingdom of God. It is narrow yet quite  _  to pass in, but first you must open your hand to God and  _  earthly things to fall. If we keep our fists  _  and hold fast to what we have and keep it for ourselves, we will be unable to  _  hold of the hand of God. Open your hand to the hand of God and you will see great things take place.\"",
