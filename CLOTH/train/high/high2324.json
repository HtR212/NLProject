British researchers believe a firm strong handshake is not just a  _  of confidence but also an indicator of a long life. Lead author Dr Rachel Cooper of University College London said her study looked  _  different reports on the  _  of handshakes. The research involved more than 50,000 men and women and  _  years. Dr Cooper concluded that  _  with weaker handshakes were 70 per cent more likely to die earlier than those with the  _  handshakes. She concludes that people with a firm strong handshake  may have benefited  from a happy childhood that  _  a healthy diet and  plenty  of exercise. The new study,  published  in the British Medical Journal, also found other signs of living a longer life. These 'measures of  _  capability' include walking at a faster pace, getting out of a chair quickly, and being able to  _  on one leg. The study showed that slow walkers were almost three times  _  to die at a younger age than those who walked quickly and actively. Those who  struggled  to get up from their armchairs were twice as likely to die earlier than those who sprang  out of  their chairs. Dr Cooper believes there  needs to be  more research into the link  _  physical capability and a long life. \"Research that helps people to  _  a long and healthy life is ever more important to help provide for an ageing  _  .\" she said.",
