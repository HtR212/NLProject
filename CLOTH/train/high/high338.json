I dressed quickly and hurried down to the dinning-room. It was a big room with six tall windows and the ugliest wallpaper I had ever seen!  _  , I had been told the hotel was not beautiful but that you were better  _  there than in any other hotel; and that was  _  I wanted just then. The waiter came hurrying up. Before I came downstairs I had prepared  _  carefully for what I must  _  . I had looked three times in my dictionary to make sure  _  the English for \"breakfast\". I had tried to get the right  _  and I had stood in the front of a mirror and twisted my mouth until it ached. The waiter asked me  _  I could not understand, but I spoke only my one prepared word \"breakfast\". He looked at me in a  _  way. So I repeated it. Still he did not understand. It was  unbelievable  that English people didn't understand their language. The waiter  _  his head and went away, but he came back in a minute and brought a tray with tea, bread and butter--- enough to feed a small army--- and went away. But I was hungry, and I left  nothing  . When the waiter came back I thought his face showed a little  _  , but you can never  _  what a waiter's face really shows. In another minute he brought  _  tray with some bacon and some eggs. He  _  have misunderstood me, but I thought it was no use explaining to people who don't understand their own language , so I just set to work on the bacon and eggs, wondering whether I could possibly clear that plate. Well, I finished the bacon and eggs. I got up and made my way back slowly - at least five pounds  _  . I never believed until then that any meal could  _  me, but on that day I met my Waterloo .",
