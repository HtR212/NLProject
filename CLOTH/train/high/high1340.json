    "article": "About a week ago, my 4yearold cousin and I were playing basketball at our local park. The  _  was warm, and many other children were outside  as well  . As we played, I noticed a small group of boys  picking on  a smaller, skinnier, and possibly younger boy. They were calling him names and  _  pushed him to the ground and  _  dirt in his face. When I saw that, I grabbed my  _  by the hand and walked over to the  _  . I stepped  _  them and the younger boy, and asked them  _  what this boy had done deserved  _  they were doing to him. They all  _  silently for a moment, and then the most amazing thing  _  :one of the boys who hadn't said anything since I  walked over  stepped around the younger boy and helped him off the  _  and then apologized. He offered to let him play with them,  _  the boy quietly said \"thank you\" and refused, and then left there. As I looked around, I  _  that there were dozens of other people at the park--some of them were  _  with children of their own--but no one else had stopped to help this boy. I felt  _  that the one of the boys was brave enough to stand up against his friends to help someone  in need  , but I felt sad that no one else had even taken a second  _  . I couldn't help but think that those parents at the park would want someone to help their child in that situation, and yet they did nothing but stood by.",
