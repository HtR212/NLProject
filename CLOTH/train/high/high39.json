It was now too\nlate to  turn back  , so he continued to climb up the mountain.\nWhile   _  in total darkness, he got into some rotten rock, and slid over the edge of\na cliff  . The good news is that he was still   _  after the fall, although he found\nhimself hanging from his rope. The bad news is, he had  _  his heavy coat during the fall and the night air was getting colder and\ncolder.\nSuddenly, from above he seemed to hear a strong deep voice, \"  _  the rope!\" What?\nOnce again, he heard a deep voice saying that.
