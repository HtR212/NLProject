He's been  _  of the back yard. I have always been around to  _  his wounds, and to comfort his feelings. But now things are going to be  _  . This morning, he is going to walk down the front steps, wave his hand and start on his great  _  that will probably include wars and tragedy and sorrow. To live his life in the world he has to live in  will require  faith and love and courage.  _  , World, I  _  you would sort of take him by the hand and teach him that things he will have to know. Teach him, but gently, if you can. Teach him that for every scoundrel there is a hero; that for every dishonest politician, there is a  _  leader; that for every enemy there is a friend. Teach him the wonders of  _  . Give him quiet time to  think over  the mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun, and flowers on the green hills.
