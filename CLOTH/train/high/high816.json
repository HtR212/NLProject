A man was  _  there with a huge box of food, a giant turkey and even some  _  to cook it in. I couldn't  _  it. My dad demanded, \"Who are you? Where are you from?\" The stranger announced, \"I'm here because a friend of yours knows you're in need and that you wouldn't accept  _  help, so I've brought this for you. Have a great Thanksgiving.\" My father said, \"No, no, we  can't  accept this.\" The stranger replied, \"You don't have  a choice  \" , closed the door and left. Obviously that experience had a profound impact on my life. I  _  myself that someday I would do well enough financially  so that  I could do the same thing for other people. By the time I was eighteen I had created my Thanksgiving ritual . I would go out  _  and buy enough food for one or two  _  . Then I would dress like a delivery boy, go to the  _  neighborhood and just knock on a  _  . I always  _  a note that explained my Thanksgiving experience  _  a kid. The note said, \"All that I ask  later  is that you take good enough care of  your family  so that someday you can do the same thing for someone else.\" I have received more from this annual ritual than I have from any amount of  _  I've ever earned. Years ago I was in New York City with my new wife during Thanksgiving. She was sad because we were not with our family.  _  she would be home decorating the house for Christmas, but we were  _  in a hotel room. When I told her what I always did on Thanksgiving, she got excited. We packed enough food for seven families for thirty days and went to buildings where half a dozen people lived in one room with no electricity and no heat in winter surrounded by rats, cockroaches and the smell of urine . It was both an  _  realization that people lived in this way and a truly fulfilling experience to make even a small difference.",
