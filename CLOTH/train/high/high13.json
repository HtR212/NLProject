    "article": "A friend and I were talking about our trip in the airport, when behind us we heard two small children screaming at the top of their voices, \"Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!\"  _  we turned to see that the \"Daddy\" they were  _  to see was their soldier father who was obviously returning from a  _  in the desert.\nThey  _  to him and jumped into his arms. They hugged him and kissed him. He hugged them and kissed them. They could not tell him everything they wanted to tell him  _  enough. He kneeled down to their level and  in between  hugs and kisses the little girl and her younger brother  took turns  crawling  on his back and shoulders.\nThe soldier's young wife and mother of the two children  stood by  patiently, allowing the children to enjoy this  _  with their daddy. When  _  turn came, they hugged and kissed each other. At one point I thought about applauding  as a way of thanking the family for their sacrifice(;) and  _  his safe return, but it seemed  _  . This was a private moment  _  by everyone in that part of the  _  . We were all frozen  in time  and immersed  in the joy of the moment. We simply allowed this soldier, his wife, and their two children the freedom to  _  their joy without limit.\nOh, it should be noted that  _  their mom and dad reconnected, the little boy was crawling up his dad's back and the little girl stood next to them jumping up and down  in expectation of  her next moment with her dad. I felt  _  with the opportunity to see the unlimited joy of a little boy, a little girl, a loving wife, and a travel weary soldier. Blessed, but also ashamed of the  _  of that kind of joy in my own life.",
