So I was delighted when my teacher announced her plans for a musical performance at Christmas.\nShe showed me a list of tunes, and I  _  a family favorite. \"Thank you, Jacquelyn,\" Sister said,  _  \"Next, please.\"\nAfter a while, when the other children studied music, Sister looked kindly at me. \"Jacquelyn, have you heard the expression tone-deaf? It means  _  you think you are singing is  _  from the music.\" Sister patted my hand. \"  _  , it's nothing to be ashamed of, dear. You can take part in it. You may mouth the words, but no  _  . Do you understand what I'm saying?\"\nAll right. But I was so  _  .

Finally her eyes grew  _  . \"I've got it!\" she said. \"I will wear my hat!\" She  _  her brown eyes on my face. Her voice  _  . \"Jacquelyn, I'm about to  _  a bit of secret information about angels, but first you must swear that you will never tell a soul.\"\n\"When I was in Rome,\" she said, \"I overheard a conversation.

Your silent words  _  off the foil. Angels capture the words and they carry up to God.\"\nAt the performance, I did just as told to. With my eyes  _  on her hat, the fact that none present could hear my voice didn't  _  . My silent singing was for God's ears  _  .\nFour years ago Aunt Dolly died at 90. Her hat, which helped us overcome life's  _  , just lay there.",
