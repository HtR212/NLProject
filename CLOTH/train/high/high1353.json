    "article": "John and Mary Howard-----my grandparents recently held a party for their 60th wedding anniversary. Our whole family was  36 _ about what to give them as presents. They both had asked that we only give them  37 _   and no gifts --they had everything already and just wanted to be with friends and    _   . Still, everyone wanted to give 39 money  or get something for them.\nI couldn't give money, but I wanted to do something  40 _    for them to let them know how     _    I am of having them as my grandparents. For this reason I went to my aunt, who they live     _    and asked her to give me all the old     _    of them that she could find. Then I put together a  44 _   photo album for them, which was 45 _   with lots of loving memories. \nWhen I gave them the photo album, I told them that I knew they didn't want  46 _   , but I hoped that they would accept just this one. As they looked     _    it, both of them burst into    _     and then  49 _   the book with everyone who was at the party. \nLater that day, before they left, my grandma gave me a big  50 _  and said, \"Thank you for giving us such a wonderful gift. I didn't  51 _    remember some of those pictures! If you hadn't made the album for us, the photos would still be in that old box, and I wouldn't have been able to share with everyone here just why I love your52 _    so much today.\"\nIt didn't 53 _   me very much --only a little time --but Grandma still    _    her book off whenever anyone comes to visit and shares the stories     _    the pictures.",
