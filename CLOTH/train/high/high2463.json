He was always telling me \"Keep your eye on the ball\" as I would not be able to catch even the  _  of throws. As I got  _  , we didn't play catch as much. If I had a problem and would go to my father to ask for his  _  , he would try to  _  with me and say \"Keep your eye on the ball\". We would both laugh  _  usually that advice was not useful to the problem, but he would try to make me  _  . My father became  _  in 1995 when I was 23. There weren't any more conversations, as he suffered from a stroke .  _  could not speak. He could only give  _  words, which were sometimes hard to understand. I seemed to be pretty good at  _  his lips after a while, even better than the  _  who were caring for him there. During one of our last conversations, I was telling him about a problem I was having with my boyfriend.  Once again  , I could read his lips: \"Keep your eye on the ball.\" We both smiled. That was the last time I saw my father  _  he passed away. Sometimes, all these years later, when I get in trouble, I just  _  myself \"Keep your eye on the ball\".",
