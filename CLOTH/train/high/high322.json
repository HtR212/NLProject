    "article": "On a cold winter day, I waited in line to see my hero, Jack Canfield, the author of , who was going to deliver a speech on his new book. During his talk, Jack  reached for  his wallet, pulled out a hundred-dollar bill, and said, ''Who wants this?\"  _  shot up in the audience; people leaned forward to see whom Jack would  _  . But I jumped up, ran up the  _  to the stage, and grabbed the bill. As I was launching myself in the air,  _  raced through my mind -- was I about to be humiliated in front of 800 people? Would they  _  security guards and take me from the stage?  _  my desire for bold action was louder than any  _  voice. As I got the bill from his hand, he said, \"That's it! We can't wait for the  _  to come to us. We must take  _  to create what we want!'' After his talk, I  _  to formally meet Jack and boldly asked for his personal e-mail address. Over the next months, I sent him emails  _  my points of view and dreams with him. He kindly e-mailed back lots of encouragement. But my life got busy  _  other things. I stopped e-mailing Jack. A year later, my dreams had worn away. I thought Jack would inspire me into action, like a giant arrow that would show me the way. I e-mailed him, and then again -- but got no  _  . As I sat down at my computer to  _  my e-mails, I  _  woke up. What was I doing? I was waiting! Now I remembered the crowd, most likely  _  that hundred-dollar bill, while they sat glued to their chairs. Usually we all have a \"Jack\" for whom we wait -- whether it's a person, a place or a thing. We  _  believe the gifts of life are just around the corner, and that everything will come in a(n)  _  way. So we don't try. We  give up  . But as Wayne Gretzky said,\"You'll always miss 100% of the opportunities you don't take!\" So I stopped waiting and started my writing career. Now what are you waiting for?",
