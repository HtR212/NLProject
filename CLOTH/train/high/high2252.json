Her mom always  _  her closet  and under her bed for monsters.\nOnce, Maria was awakened at midnight by some strange  _  coming from her window. She opened her eyes and saw a huge 3-eyed monster  _  to get into her room through the window. She was too scared to even  _  for help.\nThe monster was able to  _  the window and get in. Maria was  _  why her parents didn't wake up from all the noise. Maria's heart was  _  so fast with the monster going straight to her bed.  _  , the monster said in a low voice:\" Hello there little girl, I hope I didn't  _  you. My name is Arceus. I was wondering if I can get some  _  and cookies.\" Maria couldn't believe her  _  .\n\"So, you are not here to  _  me?\" She asked. Obviously amused, the monster laughed  _  : \"Eat you? No, no. You shouldn't be scared of me because I am a  _  monster. Can I have what I want now? Please.\" Maria got up and went to the  _  where she got some milk and cookies. Later, Arceus left the room the same way he came in.\nIn the morning, Maria woke up to her mother's voice, \"Little sweet, time for school.\" Maria told her mother the  _  and how the window got broken. Her mother   _   her that the whole thing was just a dream  _  the window wasn't broken. \"So Arceus isn't coming back?\" Maria asked.\n\"It is all up to you honey. You can  bring back  Arceus anytime you like, all you have to do is dream about him again.",
