He couldn't  _  to get into the water.\nWith  his father keeping a(n)  _  from the rocks above, Sammy jumped in. Having played in the water for a while, he  _  pulled himself out and watched a group of children walk above. Suddenly, a tiny five-year-old girl  came up  to grab a bottle and lost her balance. In an instant, she was  _  over the falls.\nSammy caught sight of the girl's arm and the  _  of her dark head as the water pushed her into the water  _  . She fought for life in the deep water. Sammy took a few seconds to consider the  _  , and then he dived in. He was next to the  _  girl in a few seconds. She was  _  and tried to climb on top of him. Sammy says, \"I stayed calm, but inside, my heart was beating  _  \"\nWhen he was an arm's  _  away from the girl, he carefully  _  the anxious girl onto his back and  _  the rock wall around the edge of the waterfall toward the shore. Soon, someone pulled  _  of them from the water with a swimming float. They were safe then.\nWhen his mother walked onto the  _  and saw the crowd gathering near the swimming hole, she fell into  _  . Then a woman came up and told her that Sammy had saved a little girl's life. \"Sammy says he can't do it  _  ,\" she says. \"But I know he can because of who he is.\" Now a seventh grader, Sammy  _  \"I didn't really think about the  _  when I got into the water.\"",
