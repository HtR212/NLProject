    "article": "Mr. Flower was well-known around for growing the best flowers of the year and his four glass-houses were taken good care of. These glass-houses were close to a public path, which was always used  _  children and young people walking to and from  _  . Boys of about thirteen years of age, especially, were often tempted to throw a stone or two at one of Mr. Flower's  _  . They managed to resist the temptation when Mr. Flower was around, but the temptation often seemed to be too  _  when Mr. Flower was  _  to be seen. For this reason, Mr. Flower did his best to be  in or close to  his glass-houses at the beginning and end of the school days. However, it was not always possible for him to be on guard at these times. Mr. Flower had tried  in many ways  to prevent the damage to his glass; but nothing that he had done had been  _  . He had been to the school to complain to the headmaster, but this had not done any  _  . He had hidden in the bushes and  run after  those boys that threw stones  towards  his garden, but the boys could run  much  faster than he, and they even  _  at him at a distance. He had even walked along the path and picked up all those  _  that he could find so that the boys would have nothing to  throw  , but they soon found others, or threw lumps of earth instead. Then just as he had given  _  hope of winning the battle, a truly wonderful  _  came up to him. He set up a large notice board made of good strong wood, some meters away from the glass-houses  where  it could be clearly seen from the path. On the board he painted the  _  : DO NOT THROW AT THIS NOTICE. After this, Mr. Flower had no  further trouble  . The boys were much more tempted to throw stones at the notice board than at the glass-houses.",
