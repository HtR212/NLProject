    "article": "It was the summer of my freshman year of college. Instead of heading home for a nice long  _  , my friends and I had decided to  _  and take some extra courses. We had  _  the top floor of an old house to live in. My bed was  _  into a stuffy former laundry room and each night was a new  _  in humidity. Still, it felt  _  to be in my own place for the first time. After the first few weeks,  _  , the thrill faded and  _  set in. I found myself sitting alone each night  thinking of  my home and my parents. My summer holidays had always been a  _  time. I spent hours playing basketball and swimming. I talked to my Mom while she tended her flowers. I  took pride in  helping my Dad drag firewood for the winter. And every night I sat at a dinner table full of delicious food  _  with love while my family filled the room with the sound of sweet  _  . Now I found myself missing them  _  than ever. Finally when my  _  were at their lowest, I heard a  _  at the door. I opened it and was  _  to see my parents standing there with big smiles to fill my  _  heart and a box full of food to feed my hungry friends. We spent the afternoon eating,  catching up  on each other's news, and just being together. It felt so good, and I felt so loved. Victor Hugo wrote that, \"The supreme happiness of life is the  _  that one is loved; loved for oneself, or better yet, loved despite oneself. \"It was that gift of happiness that my parents gave me that afternoon and every day of my life.",
