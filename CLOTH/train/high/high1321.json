    "article": "My son Tom taught me a beautiful lesson today. He is three years old and it is amazing watching him grow up. \n     He called out to me today saying, \"Papa, sit\". That usually means   _   everything and going next to him and sitting down to play with him. I did that, as he can be  _  and will not stop calling out until I   gave in  . He was playing with beads  , pushing a string through them, which is a great exercise to help   _    fine motor skills. Then, after he finished playing with the beads, it was time to put them back in the box that they are stored in. I saw him   _   pick up each bead, look at it 36 as if  it were made of chocolate and then placed it into its box. \n     With over a hundred beads to go, I was getting   _  . \"What a long time it will take! Why cannot he    _   ten beads in one go and drop them in?\" said my anxious mind. I noticed that he did this with as much   _   as he had while we were playing. I didn't see any   _   between his play and his putting away the toy. Obviously he enjoyed both. \n     Then it suddenly   _   me that this boy was enjoying the whole  _  . The journey was his goal. For him the   _  was in the game and after the game, not just in the fun part. What a great perspective: to live each moment as it is the   _  moment; to do each task as it is the most awesome task. Nothing else   _  . \n     Looking at how  _   my son was putting beads into the box   _   me that the process was the goal. The joy of pilgrimage   is not in getting there but in every  _  of the journey. \n     This is what living in the NOW is all   _  . Tom, my son, was showing me that it was about thoroughly enjoying every moment with   _   love and peace.",
