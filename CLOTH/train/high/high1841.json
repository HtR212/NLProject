    "article": "I still remember the moment I looked at my saving book when I had only two clients all month. I started my speech pathology   practice in 1998 and gradually  _  the business to 13 employees. But last year, people were not able to  pay for  speech therapy   because of the economic crisis. I cut my own  _  because I didn't want to let any of my staff go.  _  my husband, Brian, lost his job.\nWe had 11  _  in all and our oldest four were already  _  and away from home. We've always been interested in food sources and  _  the kids where their  _  came from. We love fresh vegetables, eggs or meat directly from small farms, which are safe and  _  . So we wondered what if we started farming.\nWhen a local farmer  _  we get some laying hens because there was a market for fresh  _  , our plan came together. It was scary and  _  . What if no one bought anything?  _  people did buy the eggs. The local farmer took eggs to  _  to his customers, and today he purchases about 20 dozen a week from us.\nThe children  _  out, which is important  _  we already have 270 laying hens and 200 chickens.\nThe speech therapy business is still  _  , but I put in less than ten hours a week. I know that on the  _  , there is life, there is physically satisfying work, and our family members  _  more to each other. Our quality of life is so much better. I spend most of the day with my children, which I was grateful  _  . And at night, I have the good feelings that come from working with my hands and doing something positive.",
