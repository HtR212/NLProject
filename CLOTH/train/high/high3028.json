In May, when I 12 _ the teaching, I decided to buy star-shaped pieces of paper for each kid. I wrote on each piece, \"Miss H. thinks you are a 13 _ because... \"and then wrote a little fact about each child. I wasn't sure about doing this, since the kids were so 14 _ , but one of my friends15 _ that if the star meant something to one kid then my16 _ was useful and worthy.\nOne of the little girls, Megan, had ADHD  and was going through more17 _ to see if she had another18 _ disability. The thing about her was, though, that she was so19 _ .She was clever in her own way. On her star I wrote, \"Miss H. thinks you're a star because you remember names20 _ . I also think you are clever, and I really21 _ you can do anything if you try hard enough.\"\nAfter I22 gave out the stars, I was standing in front of the23 _ helping the children clean the classroom for the end of the day. Megan came up to me,24 _ her star in her hand.\n\"Hey, do you25 _ me to read that for you, Megan?\" I asked her.                                        \"No,\" she replied, looking at me with smiling eyes, \"I already26 _ it.\" Then she said, \"You think I'm CLEVER?\" It was like I was the first person ever to27 _ her that. It was like the thought had28 _ even crossed her mind29 _ she read that star.\nIt was by far the greatest30 _ in my teacher career. Whenever I feel discouraged in the classroom, I think of it.",
