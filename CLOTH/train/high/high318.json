Two weeks later, Dad didn't come home on time. We didn't think it was serious   _   it wasn't the first time. We waited, and   _   at midnight Dad came in. We asked where he'd been. He just   _  , \"I am leaving tomorrow for Afghanistan .\"\nHearing that, we were in   _  , thinking that this could not be happening to us. But when he started   _   his desert uniforms we knew it was for real.\nHe sat us all down and my brothers and I had a discussion about   _   we were going to do while he was away. And then we   stayed up   and helped him get ready. We   _   his uniforms and talked more about what we needed to do. We didn't get to sleep   _   4 a.m. Therefore, my dad called school to   _   we were not going to be there that day.\nWe took off for Madison   _   he would check in and get ready to leave. When we got there the official told us that he   _   leave until 5 p.m. We had our last   _   together and then headed to the airport. We were told it was time to leave. We hugged him and said   _  .\n\"  _   is going to happen to me, and I love you,\" he said. Then he was   _  . We left the airport not saying anything to each other.\nMy dad is   _   gone, and he won't be home for a while. He talks to us   _   on the phone. I hope that my story makes you think about your own family now and what   _   to you.",
