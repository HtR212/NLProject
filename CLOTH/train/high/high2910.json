    "article": "Dear Aihua,\nHow are you? I'v been busy arranging my  _   with my brother, Colin. We plan to   _   a few weeks travelling before he is admitted to the university. We will   _  so many exciting places and do lots of  _   things.\nMy first   _   is Morocco, in northern Africa. We're going to   _   camels through the Sahara Desert. I  _   it will be very hot, dry and   _   there. Even though it may feel uncomfortable to sit on a   _   for almost a week, I still look forward to it.\nThen we are going to travel down the River Nile. We will   _   white-water rafting there. It's so   _   that we have to wear special clothing, a helmet and a life jacket for protection just   in case   the rafts gets turned upside down or sinks.\nAfter that, we will live with the   _   people in Kenya and   _   local customs . We'll eat and drink  _   they do, including cow's blood!\nDue to the   _   walk we have to cover everyday, I need to buy a large, strong, light backpack to carry my  _  of food and water. During the day, we'll walk   _   the land, following the   _   of big animals. Of course, I will try to   get close to   the animals to take some good photos. I will email you as soon as I come back.\nLove\nToby",
