    "article": "I was in a hotel ballroom in Washington, back in 2004, to cover the National Spelling Bee .\nOne of the 265 kids was Akshay Buddiga, a 13-year-old from Colorado Springs. His brother had   _   the bee two years before, and Akshay wanted to   _   his brother's success.\nYou could learn at Harvard University all day and   _   hear the words used in the National Spelling Bee. These words live in the   _   corners of dictionaries. Each speller steps up to the microphone, and the official pronouncer 45 _  a word. If the speller gets it right, there's a moment of   _   , then three magic words: that is   _  .\nAkshay's moment came in round six. His word was \"alopecoid\", meaning \"like a fox\". He   _  the word, but there was a problem. In his head, he saw two   _   spellings and he couldn't decide which was right.\nHe had two minutes to   _   the word. He asked to hear the word again, trying to   _  between the two versions in his head. He jammed his hands in his pockets. Without knowing it, he stood so straight that he   _   his knees. He started to feel   _  . He crashed to the stage so   _   that his feet flew into the air.\nThe audience made this sound: ohhhhhhhhOHHHHHHHHohhhhhhhh.\nAn official said, \"  _   the clock.\" The room went   _   except for the click-click-click of the photographer's cameras.\nAkshay raised his head, looking around the room for a few seconds. Then he got up.\n\"Take a   _   ,\" one official said.\nAkshay didn't. He went straight to the microphone and said, \"A-L-O-P-E-C-O-I-D.\" The official didn't leave room for the silence. She spoke   right away   , \"That's correct.\"\nAkshay ended up finishing second. He later said a lot was going through his mind when he was   _   there. \"Mostly, all the work that I'd done,\" he added. As he walked to the microphone, he decided he didn't care if he made a mistake. He was going to   _   himself.\nHe was correct.",
