To this very day, I still  _  it; I am a genius   , and I apply my wisdom.\n  At the time  ,I was a high school dropout   and was living in a tent in Hawaii. I had a very limited vocabulary and had never  _  reading a single book. When Dr Bragg taught me this statement, he held me to say it with feeling  as if  it were true and present. To do so seemed so far away from  _  that it was funny. After saying it many times,  _  . I began to feel what those powerful words meant.  _  every day I continued to say it, and it became  easier  to believe; I am a genius, and I apply my wisdom.\nIt was two and a half years later when I really saw the  _  of the statement. I was sitting in a college library  _  by fellow students whom I was helping with higher mathematics. I heard one of the students speak  _  to another, \"John is really a  genius  ! At the moment, I  _  what Dr Bragg had taught me, and I  _  to say this statement for the rest of my life.\nI can't quite put into words what a(n)  _  this statement has made in my life.  Because of  it, I was able to change from a dropout to the top of my college classes. I think that the key to  _  is putting your true feelings into a statement you  believe in  and saying it over and over every day.",
