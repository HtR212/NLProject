My father was not always there for us, my mom smoking, and the unclean house. It was  _  ; the sky was a deep navy blue, when my Mom, my brothers, and I heard the three hard knocks on our  _  door. Dad wasn't there because he was in prison. We saw the red and blue flashing lights outside and  _  ,\"It's the police.\" I don't remember who, but someone opened the door to  _  two tall and attractive policemen. The policemen  _  my brothers and me out to their cars, while my mom staggered behind with  _  . The street was quiet as though a  _  could be heard, and the neighbors came out to  _  what was happening. \"You can't take them away from me. You can't! \" cried my mom. One of the policemen replied  _  , \"We have to, Miss. This is no place to bring up children. They'll be in(a) good  _  .\" I decided to go to the farthest police car with my younger brother, Alec, to avoid the neighbors'  _  . I somehow felt ashamed. The policeman turned his car key in the car and it  started up  . We drove away from my apartment, neighbors, and my mom,  _  them behind. The night went by very fast. One minute I'm being  _  away from my mom, the next I'm in a policeman's car, and now I find myself in a nursery  _  with my brothers. For three  _  years I lived with a very nice family with my brothers in the town of Leominster. On the third year of my  _  at the nursery home, I met this very strange  _  lively couple who treat us well. That moment had changed everything that was going to happen to me. A major turning point in my life  _  when my brothers and I were adopted .",
