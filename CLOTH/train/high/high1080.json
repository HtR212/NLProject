    "article": "As I was driving out of the store parking lot, they crossed in front of me.My first reaction was filled with  _  at being delayed for a whole ten seconds.But I quickly became  _  when I realized that it was an elderly  _  . The man leaned on his  _  who walked in front of him.He not only used her for  _  but it was obvious that he was blind.The two of them  _  as one--each needing the other to  _  in this fast-changing world. That little example of true strength  _  my whole personal perception of life that day.Suddenly I wasn't so  mad about  having to work a few extra hours on Saturdays.I had my  _  ,and I was still  _  young. That picture of those two elderly people walking with dignity and strength  stayed with  me the entire week.My  _  wasn't so bad after all.I had my health and a good job.I had a wonderful,  _  wife.I started to think--not only was I  _  to have these all, but so was that wonderful old couple,who,  despite  the trials and sufferings of a long life,still had the love and support of each other to  _  them through this world. There are so many people out there just like that couple.My wife and I sometimes  _  ourselves in our old age, walking arm in arm into the sunset. That image always gives us a  _  feeling.Just remember, none of us would be here if it wasn't for our elders.We all should spend a little extra time and patience,  when it comes to  helping our elder friends.",
