    "article": "My brother,Mark,died in a traffic accident four years ago. He was my big brother and  _  looked after me. I am  _  today for all of the special times we had as running partners,and times  _  driving to different races,where we had so many  _  about life in general. I  _  these talks terribly at this time of the year.  _  ,I am so happy he shared with me the  _  of his faith. He was always so  _  to people,and I had been with him many times  _  we pulled over to help someone in need,  _  a smile and helping them get back on the road. So I was not  _  when he told me of the time when he was  _  in college. It was the end of the month. To make matters worse,it was Friday and he had no  _  in his pocket for the weekend. Payday was Monday and he had no gas money to get home to  _  my dad and no money to buy food but he had faith that helping others  _  helping yourself. On his way home from classes that day,as he was driving along,he noticed a guy ahead of him  _  his lumber all over the road as he turned the corner. Mark  _  right over and helped him load the lumber back into his truck. The guy was so thankful and  _  his hand to Mark,and in it was one hundred dollars. Mark couldn't believe his  _  . He told him that was unnecessary but the man  _  and off he drove. I still think of Mark sitting there telling me that story, with tears in his eyes, and how faithful he was.",
