    "article": "When I was 18, I worked in a primary school. Twice a week, after their regular school day, 16 kids whose  _  are from 10 to 11 years old would gather round me in my reading club  _  as I read aloud the stories on the book bought from Canada.\nAt first, all the  _  were shy and I didn't quite know what they could  _  from me. After all, as far as I could tell,   _  of them had been exposed to story books before. After some time, they became  _  enough to answer all my questions and  _  the story with others. After each session, one student would borrow the book to take home as long as they agreed to  come back  the next time with a short written book report. They would also need to   _  their reports to the class. In this way, the class was a big  _  and I was so proud to hear their reports.   _  all the students were shy at first, they felt pretty  _  later. All of them were very  _  to make reports. Every Monday was the day of our show, where we had those, who had prepared for book reports,   _  their work on stage. What a   _  time it was for us! And I was  _   proud of each one of them.\nMohamed was one of my students in this reading club. He always listened  _  with his full attention and I could just  _  in his eyes the thirst for learning, discovering and thinking. And then, 7 months later, I received the beautiful short email from his father to show his   _  . It said, \"It is you who made my son like  _  .\" He also let me know that Mohamed still had the little note of encouragement I once gave him when he had litter interest in his studies.",
