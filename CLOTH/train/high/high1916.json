The good doctor had some  _  theories on planting trees. He believed in \"No pains, no gains\". He never  _  his new trees, which was  _  many people. Once I asked why. He  _  that watering plants spoiled them, and that if you water them, each following tree generation will  _  weaker and weaker. So you have to make things  _  for them. He talked about how watering trees  made for  shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in  _  of water. I came to understand that he meant deep roots were to be  _  . I planted a couple of trees a few years back and I took good care of them. Two years of  _  has resulted in trees that expect to be waited on hand and foot. Whenever a cold wind blows, they  _  and tremble their branches. Funny things about those trees of Dr. Gibbs'. The lack of water seemed to  _  them in ways comfort and ease never could. I used to  _  for my sons that their lives will be easy. But  _  I've been thinking that it's time to  _  my prayer. I know my children are going to meet  _  , and I'm praying they will be strong. The prayer for comfort is seldom met. What we need to do is to pray for deep roots,  _  when the winds blow, we won't be  _  away.",
