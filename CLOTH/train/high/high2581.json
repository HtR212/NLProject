    "article": "Every day as I drove through town, I saw a one-legged man going through the dustbins next to McDonalds looking for food. It was only a month  _  Christmas, starting to get cold and I could not help  thinking about  him.\nSo I bought a brush, loads of bread, cans of fish, and added a blanket and sweatshirts. I made a box up like a present and went  in search of  this man. I saw him hobbling   away from the dustbins. I pulled over, took the box and  went up  to him. I said, \"I would like to give you a Christmas present, and there are some food  _  here and some things you might be able to use.\"\nHe sidestepped around me and said, \"No, thank you, I just had lunch. I don't need  _  .\"\nThen he hobbled on down the sidewalk,  _  me standing there in tears. I took the box down to a little shop that gave things out to the  _  and homeless and told them what had happened and asked that they should give the  _  to someone who could use it. The person there told me not to be  _  and they thought my feelings were hurt as I was  _  crying. I told her I was not crying for me but for him because what I had done  took away  his dignity  by treating him like a person in need. I was so  _  .\nA few years later I was able to  _  in St. Anthony's Dining Room in San Francisco. These people had to stand in  _  for up to 6 hours to receive the  _  food they could get. We took one tray of food at a time, and treated them  as if  they were in a restaurant ordering a meal they were paying for and when we took our  _  , we would sit down with one of them and talk and  _  our food with someone if we had too much.\nFrom my own experience, I have learned a great lesson.  _  help is sometimes harder than giving it.",
