The sad news, so unexpected, shook the unusually  _  and unhurried politician off her balance. Though she did her best to  _  as if nothing had happened and made her public appearance as usual, people could not fail to notice that she was no longer the old self-assured prime minister who always had everything under  _  . Instead she had become a very sad mother who was unable to  _  from her shock. One day when she was to  _  at a lunch party, a reporter caught her off her guard by bringing up the  _  of her missing son again. She was  _  mentally unprepared for the question and lost her self-control. Tears were  rolling down  her cheeks  _  she sobbingly told the reporter there was still no news of Mark and that she was very worried about him. She said that all the countries concerned had  _  to do their best to help her find her son. With that she  _  down completely and sobbed silently for quite a while. Gradually she calmed down and started to speak as  _  . It was a very  _  scene which exposed a new side of Mrs. Thatcher's  _  the public do not usually see. People began to talk about the Iron Woman's  _  love, a  _  that is common to all human race. Later Mark returned  safe and sound  to his mother's side, good-humored and all smiles as usual  as if  nothing unusual had ever happened. The Iron Woman,  _  , broke down again and was  _  sobbing for a second time.",
