    "article": "It was Christmas Eve 1881. I was 15 years old and feeling like the world was   _  for me because there hadn't been enough money to buy me the rifle  that I'd wanted that year.\nPa came back in and there was ice in his beard. \"Come on, Matt,\" Pa said. \"Dress warmly. It's cold outside. We're going to Widow Jensen's. They are   out of   wood.\" Widow Jensen lived about two miles down the road. Her husband had died a year or so before and   _   her with three children, the oldest being eight.\nI   _  went out with Pa and we   _   the sled  high with wood.   _  we went to the store and Pa took down a big ham, some bacon, a sack of flour and some shoes, which were put into a smaller sack. We rode the two miles to Widow Jensen's in   _  . I tried to think through what Pa was doing. I knew we didn't have much money and Widow Jensen had   _   neighbors than us. It shouldn't have been our   _  .\nWidow Jensen opened the door and let us in. She had a blanket wrapped around her   _  .The children were wrapped in   another  and were sitting in front of the fireplace by a very small fire that   _  gave off any heat at all. \"We brought you a few things , Ma'am,\" Pa said and set down the sack of flour. I put the meat on the table. Then Pa handed her the sack that had the shoes in it.\nShe   _   and took the shoes out one pair at a time. I watched her carefully. She bit her lower lip to keep it from   _   and then tears filled her eyes and started running down her cheeks. She looked up at Pa like she wanted to say something,   _  it wouldn't come out. \"We brought a load of wood too, Ma'am,\" Pa said. Then he turned to me and said,\"Matt,go bring some in. \"\nI wasn't the   _  person when I went back out to bring in the wood. I choked and as much as I hate to   _  it, there were tears in my eyes too. In my mind I kept   _   those three kids huddled  around the fireplace and their mother standing there with tears running down her cheeks with so much   _   in her heart that she couldn't speak. Just then the rifle seemed very   _  . Pa had given me the best Christmas of my life.",
