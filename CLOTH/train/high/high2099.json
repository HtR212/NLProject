Whenever he did anything, he 22 _  ended up tearing his jacket, getting a hole in his sock, or ripping   the knee of his trousers. Everyone said he should take more care, but Lemon found that really 23 _ . So, one day, he had the happy 24 _  of buying himself a sewing machine. This machine was so 25 _  that it sewed everything up within a moment. It seemed that Lemon wouldn't have to 26 worry about  his things anymore.\nSoon, the most 27 _  day in Lemon's life arrived. It was the day when everyone in town prepared a party for him, in 28 _  of Lemon's many years of service in making the citizens 29 _ . On that day he wouldn't have to wear his 30 _  clown suit. That day he would be 31 _  like anyone else.\n32 _ , the night before, he had a look in his closet, and there wasn't a single suit in\n33 _  condition. They were all ripped and torn  , with dozens of sewing marks. Lemon couldn't 34 _  go to the party dressed in those. Well, Lemon was sharp and 35 _ , and he solved this 36 _  by attending the celebration in his usual clown suit. That surely\n37 _  the audience, but Lemon wasn't happy with it. He had 38 _  of being the hero of the show just for one day in the year, and not just the clown.\nVery early the next day, Lemon 39 _  all those damaged old suits, and since then, he has looked after his clothes with great care. He 40 _  that if one person tries to continually cover up faults, he will have no way to hide them some day.",
