I  _  most patients with a gentle hug and a kiss on the cheek.I can usually  _  whether or not a patient is comfortable with this  _  .\nAfter my third  _  to Mary, I asked politely. \"Would you like a hug and a kiss on your cheek?\"\nMary smiled, \"Yes, I'd love one.\"  _  I drew back,I noticed a tear working its  _  down one cheek. \"What's wrong?\"I asked.\n\"That's the first time anyone has  _  me this way since I was attacked by AIDS. The medical staff   touch me, but...\" she said between sobs  . I simply sat beside her,  _  in silence.\nA few days later, when I went to see Mary  _  , one of her sons and his wife were visiting. \"Good evening, Mary. I see you have  _  , so I'll stop back later,\"I said, giving her a gentle hug and a kiss. Mary grabbed my right wrist as I turned to  _  . \"Wait a minute, Mack. I want you to meet my son, John, and daughter-in-law, Sarah.\"During the  _  , her anxious family sat clear across the room  _  Mary's bed.\nLater, when I looked in on her, her visitors were still keeping their  _  distance.\nThe  _  evening, John and Sarah were back again, and the scene  _  itself like a familiar rerun on television. I went in, gave Mary a hug and a kiss,  _  to come back later.\nWhen I returned,  _  had changed, John and Sarah were seated in chairs -- one on each side of Mary's  _  -- and they were holding hands.\nObviously moved, John said, \"I guess nothing to  be afraid of  if a stranger can hug and kiss my mother.\"",
