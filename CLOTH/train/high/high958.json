One of my patients told me that when she tried to tell her story, people often  _  to tell her that they once had something just  _  that happened to her. Her pain became a story about  _  . So, finally she stopped  _  to most people because she just felt too lonely. When we interrupt what someone is  _  to let them know that we understand, we  _  the focus of attention to ourselves. But if we just  _  , they know we care. Many people with cancer can talk about the relief of having someone just listen. I have  _  learned to respond to someone crying by just listening.
