    "article": "I stopped at a red light only a mile or so from my goal of my brother's house. We were planning to   _   down together to North Carolina to be with my father who was critically ill.\nAs I   _   at the stop light, I noticed Sharper's Florist over to the left. It was the same   _   I had stood as a young man nervously   picking out   some roses for my date -- floods of   _   went through my mind. I noticed the liquor   store straight ahead where my father and I had been many times before,   _   the beer of the week. We both liked German beer.\nThe light finally turned   _  . And I made my left turn and went through the   _   section of our hometown. I remembered how each thanksgiving my   _   would be together, including my parents and my brother. I also remembered how my father would   _   some time every thanksgiving, making sure there was no one   _   in the neighborhoods surrounding where we lived. I can remember as a young boy going with him to   _   some food. I was scared. I had   _   been into this part of town this deeply before. But my father seemed   _   and went about his business.\nThe people seemed to know him and   _   accepted what he came to offer. My father seemed able to give away the food in a way that honored those he was giving to. He would   _   at each place and talk a little.\nMy father wanted to be sure   everyone   had food. If there were people he found who didn't have food, he would   go back   and get more. That's the kind of man he was.\nI pulled into the driveway of my brother's home. I got out of the   _   and my brother Joel was there to meet me. We hugged and Joel said Dad had   passed away   just an hour ago. How I hoped I could see him for the last time! But I had no chance.",
