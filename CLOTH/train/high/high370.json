    "article": "It was a bright spring afternoon when Freda told me she wouldn't need me any more. I had just finished my four-hour work -  _  up and down the stairs of her three-storey home, cleaning the floor and washing the dished. She was  _  jeans and a sweater. Sitting at the table I had just  _  a pile of papers spread around her. Her husband's  _  was going to be reduced by thirty percent. And they were trying to live as if it had  _  happened. I felt sorry for her, but I also felt a sense of  _  . I had been cleaning Freda's house for five years and had  _  an unexpected relationship with the family. It was not just  _  I had become an expert at scraping dirt stuck to their wooden floor.  _  that I had learned exactly how to place toys on the girls' beds. It was  _  than that, for I felt I had become a part of their  _  . Freda stayed at home with the kids,  _  I would often see her in the morning  _  them to school. And I'd be there when they  _  home at lunch for sandwiches and piano practice. I had  _  them grow up. Now I was fired, but the  _  thing was that I still wanted to keep scraping away the dirt and dust for the family. I left Freda's  _  relationship with my clients . Who am I  _  them? As a matter of fact. I'm  _  an employee - the lowest kind of employee. But I'm also a trusted  _  of the family. I can't help worrying about what happens around me.",
