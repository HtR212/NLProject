It\nlooked like a(n)  _  pot, but it was really magical.\nNext, my mom  _  to\ngo shopping to buy things for our new house,  _  she\nwent to a supermarket. The people there looked at her  _  as\nif she had come from the outer space. Then she went to the post office to  _  a letter to my grandparents. The people there thought she was  _  . They looked at her just the same as the people at the supermarket did.\nShe went and  _  many more hairdressers to help\nher with her crazy curly hair! None of them could fix her hair. She  _  to all the hairdressers, \"You  _  yourselves\nhairdressers---you're just not seeing my crazy hair!\" Then she rushed home.\nWhen she got home, my mom screamed to the   _  , \"You magical potato pot! You just can't do\nanything!\" Then, my mom went to the bathroom, and she  took down  the pot. \"WOW!\" My mom screamed, \"MY HAIR IS ALL STRAIGHT!\"\nShe made a(n)  _  to the pot and said, \"You are\nreally magical. I am sorry it is my  _  .\" The pot said\n, \"You mean you have done something  _  to me?\"\nMy mom said, \"Ah, you are a magical potato pot. Get back in the cupboard!\"\nNow you know, if your hairdresser is really clumsy and you want straight hair, just find a magical pot.",
