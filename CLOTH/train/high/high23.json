    "article": "One rainy afternoon I was sitting at home feeling so bored.   Instead of   feeling sorry for myself, I wanted to meet people and have new   _   so I decided to start volunteering. I found a website where I could volunteer on a farm in France.\nVolunteering   _   so many opportunities to have fun and share   _   stories.It was the first time for me to work on a farm.It was almost a(n)   _   holiday as food and accommodation were provided.It was not one   _   holiday, however, as I had to   attend to   fifteen horses and sheep!I soon discovered that I was a(n)   _   farmer but it did not matter because I made some great friends and also improved my   _  .\nHowever, you do not   _   go abroad to volunteer.I have had plenty of adventuers at home as volunteering can become a   _  . For example, I love   _   so I had a good laugh waving my arms in order to   _   my local choir . At university, I organized a concert for charity with my friends. It was really   _   to find bands and raise money for a cause.\nIt is true that you feel good volunteering but there are also other   _  .I once volunteered as a steward   at a charity sports event where the organizers   _   gave me cupcakes from an expensive London bakery to thank me for my   _  . I also volunteered in a charity shop so I found loads of nice cheap clothes to   _   my wardrobe .\nWhile this is all fun, my favourite aspect of volunteering is   _   and sharing stories. My terrible   _   at farming has given me funny stories to tell!",
