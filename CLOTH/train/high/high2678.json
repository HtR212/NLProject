    "article": "Long long ago, a circle missed one piece of its own. The circle wanted to be whole, so it went around looking for its  _  piece. But because it was  _  and therefore could roll only very slowly, it  _  the flowers along the way. It  _  with the worms. It enjoyed the sunshine. It found lots of different pieces, but  _  of them fitted. So it left them all by the side of the road and  kept on  searching. Then one day the circle found a piece that fitted  _  . It incorporated the missing piece into itself and began to roll.  Now that  it was a perfect circle, it could roll very fast,  _  fast to notice the flowers or talk to the worms. After it realized how different the world seemed when it rolled so quickly, it  _  , left its found piece by the side of the road and rolled slowly away. The  _  of the story, I suggest, is that in some strange  _  we are more whole when we are missing something. The man who has  _  is in some ways a poor man. He will never know what it  _  like to nourish his soul with the dream of something  _  . When we accept that  _  is part of being human and when we can continue rolling  _  life and appreciate it, we will have  _  a wholeness that others can only desire, which , I believe, is  _  God asks of us -- not \"Be perfect\", not \"Don't even make a mistake\",  _  \"Be whole\".",
