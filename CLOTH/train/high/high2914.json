At about nine this evening, a lady named Mrs. Humney was  _  and killed. Anyone who can supply any clue is requested to report to the  _  .\" The news made the lonely girl  _  with fear. She couldn't help looking  _  , but she didn't notice that a man was already  _  behind thedoor to the balcony . All of a sudden the man appeared before Aileen. \"Don't ask for  _  . Put your jewellery on the table, and then think over  _  I shall be safe to stay up here for the night,\" said he. That made Aileen even more  _  , but she tried to  _  herself. Just then came the whistle of a police car. Then someone rang the doorbell. The robber said with a gun  _  the girl's back, \"Go to the door and say that you've gone to bed.\" Suddenly, the girl had a(n)  _  . \"Oh, who are you?\" she said. \"Bull. Is there anything  _  ?\" asked the policeman Bull. \"No.\" Immediately she added loudly, \"  _  , my elder brother extends his  _  greeting to you.\" \"Thank you. Good night!\" Bull replied in the same  _  . A few minutes later the sound of the police car going  _  could be heard. \"It's well  _  ,\" the robber said. Then he rushed to the girl. Almost at the same time the glass on the window was broken. The policemen hurried into the room and caught the robber. \"Aileen, the greeting was so good that it made us take  _  right away,\" said Bull, \"because we've already known that your  _  was killed in a robbery half a year ago.\"",
