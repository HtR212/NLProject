We were standing in line for 45minutes to enjoy the  _  up to the watch point. When we got there, we went around the  _  of the tower and saw the hard wire fence  _  to the structure serving as a barrier. We went back inside to look for the glass floor that provided a direct view  _  . As soon as both of us  _  , we stopped before walking onto it. We found that our legs began to  _  . I stopped for a minute considering the step, taking several seconds to  look over  the edge before moving. And then I had a thought in my mind:\"It is far  _  compared to any other floor in this building. There is no real danger to me -- it's  _  an illusion. Look at all the people standing on it, and think about those who have stood on it before.\"I began to  _  that step onto the glass floor. I didn't look down --  at least  not for a few minutes. I walked on the  _  and looked around and thought about how  _  the experience was. I even found myself jumping up and down. There was no  _  , and it was certainly an illusion. I considered how many things in our lives we  _  and exactly how many of them are actually illusions. I thought about all the things we  _  ourselves from doing because we have  _  ourselves into thinking there's risk. I thought about all the things that I still have yet to do that appeared  _  I was glad to discover that although fear isn't a stranger to me, my desire to live a life without  _  has a much stronger pull.",
