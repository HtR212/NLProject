    "article": "Culture shock is a complex topic, but I'm a simple man with simple perspectives. So my experience of foreign culture boils down to three basic stages: anger, acceptance and appreciation. \nWhen I began my life in China I was often filled with frustration and   _  over the way things\nwere. Things were seen as clearly \"  _  \" and I\nrejected the view of there being other ways of doing things. Afterwards I came\nto  _  different ways of doing things but still\nsaw my own ways as superior.\nMy views were still heavily color1ed by   _  and I often accepted situations I felt  _  by\nsimply coining the phrase \"That's China,\"  _  China was a backward country that simply didn't do things correctly.\nFinally, however , I came to understand and appreciate the new  _  and ways of doing things, sometimes using them as effectively as the  _  .\nFor example, fish is never    _  with the head in my country, thus my feelings went from \"Ugh! I can't\neat this! The fish is  _  at me\nsaying, `You're a  _  man.' Take this off the\ntable,\" to \"I'll let my friends enjoy, but I'll just stick with the other\ndishes,\" and to \"Would anyone mind if I eat the eyeball?\"\nIt is not the same with every westerner, and some take   _  than others to go\nthrough the three stages. It all depends on how  _  you\nare and how tightly you  _  to your own culture.\nIt took a little over a year of living in China before I finally appreciate the\nnew culture. Now, I'm more  _  in\nChina than in my own country.",
