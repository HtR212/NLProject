It is   _   because the weather has been a lot warmer over the past few years, which   results in   the melting  of the ice in the Antarctic. This will soon cause water levels to   _   and flood parts of the world.\nMany people ignore this problem because they feel   as if   they can't do anything about it and have more   _   things to worry about. If we all   _   so, then our ozone layer  will be   _   and the planet will no longer be able to  make life continue to exist. We should do our best to limit the use of our planet's   _   resources  and keep our air clean.   _  , future generations will suffer from our   _  .\nSome might feel that they can't stop global warming from   _  . But if every single  person does his or her part in keeping the air clean, then it will become a   _   effort. Sure, there are some things that cause pollution and that we won't be able to   _   change. This may include cars burning oil, but we can   at least   adjust some of these things. People can start carpooling, taking the bus, riding their bikes, or   _   just walking.\nIf everyone takes   _   now, I believe we can start seeing remarkable results within a few years.",
