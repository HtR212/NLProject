    "article": "It was the golden season. I could see the yellow leaves falling with the cool wind. For others, it is a/an  _  season, while for me, it is an annoying season. Tired from preparing for Postgraduate Entrance Examination, I decided to have a  _  along the Yanjiang Road in my university. \"Autumn is a lonely season and life is  _  . The days in this season always get me down \", I was in deep thought when the sound of a guitar  _  into my ears, like a stream flowing from the mountains. I was so surprised that I ran to see what it was. A young girl, sitting on the lawn, was  _  in playing her guitar. The music was so attractive that I listened quietly. Lost in the music, I did not realize that I had been standing for so long. But my  _  did not seem to disturb her. Leaves were still falling. Every day when I passed by the lawn, I would see her playing her guitar. During the rest of the days in the season, life became interesting and I could  go over  the courses carefully. Though we did not know each other, I thought we were always good friends. Autumn was nearly over. One day, when I was listening  _  , the sound suddenly stopped. To my astonishment, the girl came  _  to me. \"You must like the music,\" she said. \"Yes, you play very well. Why did you stop?\" I asked. Suddenly, a  _  expression appeared on her face and I could feel something unusual. \"I came here just to have a rest because I failed in the college entrance examination. I felt very disappointed. And it was your listening every day  _  encouraged me,\" she said, \"and I have to go tomorrow.\" \"  In reality  , it was your playing that gave me a meaningful autumn and helped me believe that I have the ability to pass the Postgraduate Entrance Examination.\" I answered, \"I think it was God who gave us the chance to know each other and we should be good friends She smiled and I smiled. Since then, I have never seen her again. I no longer passed by that  _  . Only thick leaves were  _  behind. But I will always remember the  _  of the girl. It was her appearance that helped me passed the Postgraduate Entrance Examination. We may encounter many people in our lives. Some are like a shooting star, but  give off  so much light that they guide you in the correct  _  ; some are like  _  in you, they are always with you, but do not understand you. Just as a famous saying, many people  _  in your life, but only true friends leave footprints. I shall always  _  the autumn, the girl and the sound of her guitar. I know she will always be my best friend.",
