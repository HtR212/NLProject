    "article": "It was hot and humid. I   _   myself out of the house to ride my bike along the Hudson River. I had   _   myself I would learn to ride with no hands and my summer freedom is decreasing.   _   lifting my hands before losing balance, I rode steadily up the bike path. \nLater, I parked my bike and lay down on a wooden   _  . Just as I got   _  , a man appeared in my vision. \"It looks like it's going to rain,\" he said. \"I was just like you once,\" the man continued. \"One day, I went for a bike ride and lay down on a bench,   even though   it started to rain. People walking by me probably thought I was   _  .\" I listened, with the rain falling down. \"Rain is like therapy  ,\" he said, \"  _   you just lie there and let it fall on your face.\"  \n\"I'm taking a tai chi class, and there's this word, Kua, that means 'Everything in the   _   is connected.'\" He began to sway   a little. \"When the shoulders move, the hips move. Everything is connected.\" The rain fell   harder  , and I told the man I'd better get home. \"Nice to meet you,\" he said, and we called each other's bikes beautiful before   _   forever.\nI had never ridden in the rain before. I was   _   that I wouldn't be able to practice my hands-free skills on the way home. But then a(an)33 _  thought came into my mind: Why not?  The wind and icy summer rain beat my face   _   my bent knees took turns being first and I   _   my arms in the air, my balance holding strong. I yelled to no one   in particular  . I'd never been more truly in the moment. Everything was connected.\nFor the first time, I saw the cruelty of umbrellas for   _   us from the soft, healing, tapping raindrops. Like an umbrella, the codes of urban society prevent us from having   _  with strangers. The danger is understandable, but the   _   of riding a bike with no handlebars and the refreshment of   _   words from a mysterious stranger is worth getting a little wet.",
