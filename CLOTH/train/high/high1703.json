    "article": "I have been paralyzed  from the neck downwards since I was born in 1971 and spent my life wheelchair-bound. However,   in spite of   this I have been lucky enough to travel the world, develop a (an)   _   career and establish a supportive group of family and friends.\nGrowing up in a home full of love,   _   and faith, my parents and siblings   helped me to live a   _   normal life. However, it was through   _   that I was able to   _   normal childhood activities,   _   I was able to feel the   _   by drawing young girls dancing and running, which my   _   kept me from participating in.\nAs a young girl I had an art exhibition in my hometown of Copenhagen   _   my artwork. The local paper   _   my exhibition and printed an article and photos of me with my paintings. Upon seeing this article, an international organization the Mouth and Foot Painting Artists (MFPA)   got in touch   and offered me a scholarship,which helped develop my   _   abilities and   _   my career as a painter by providing me with   funding   for art classes and materials. I have been with the MFPA for 14 years and I paint with my   _  . Like all the artists I make my living through the   _   of reproductions of my paintings in the form of cards and calendars which are sold directly to the public. Through the MFPA, which has been helping 802 mouth and foot painters like me to create a   _   future since 1957, I am   _   surrounded by fellow mouth and foot painters, who have   _   and assisted me with my work.",
