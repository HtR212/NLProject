Scientists chose  _  because the animals are herbivores , which would mean that they would love sweets. However, the plant they choose, the bamboos, has a very  _  sugar content and is therefore not considered sweet. Could this mean that pandas have  _  their hobby for sweet things? The pandas were given six kinds of sweet liquids that are  _  found in fruits and vegetables. They were also given  _  at the same time. In each of the taste tests, the animals  _  the natural sweeter liquids and ignored the water  _  . They ate up all the sweet liquids and the water was left untouched. What was even more interesting is that when the scientists  _  the water with five different man-made sweeteners, ones that humans find delicious, the pandas were not as  _  . In these tests, they picked the water instead. The scientists believe that it could be either because pandas found them to be too  _  or not sweet enough and that the mixture could not  _  the pandas. The scientists were not too  _  by the results, since pandas in zoos have always shown a preference for treats like apples, sweet potatoes and even mooncakes. Scientists believe that the pandas may have once  _  sweeter foods that were available in the lowland areas that they used to live in. But when human settlement in the lowland areas  _  them to the bamboo forests in the mountains, they had no  _  but to settle for the almost sugarless plants.",
