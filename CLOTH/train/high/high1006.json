    "article": "Learning how to be patient with people can be challenging for some people. After all, not everybody is gifted with great   _  . The good news is that it is something that can be   _   and eventually perfected.\nWhen the customer before you takes ages to   pay for   his or her groceries, you tap your foot impatiently and cough every now and then to remind the   _   to move quickly; but no, he is still not   _  . It takes all of your power not to make a scene. However, if you   _   that customer to be someone you like, then you will find yourself not getting too   _  , right?\nSo the next time you find yourself losing patience with somebody, simply think of that person to be someone you really   _   and your patience will last longer.\nThe second step on how to be patient with people involves whistling. When you whistle a   _   tune, you are instantly in good   _  . You can hum   your favorite song if you can't whistle---it really doesn't make a(n)   _  . What's important here is that you did something that makes you feel good. And when you feel good, you are more   _   to be patient with the people around you.\nWhen you're stressed, it's almost impossible to learn how to be patient with people. You've got to find a way to   _   first. If you know you're going to be in a situation where your patience will be tested, get yourself a massage  first. Remember : the more stressed you are, the   _   you'll lose your temper.\nLearning how to be patient with people is not a   _   in life. You've seen people who manage to survive day to day with unbelievably short tempers after all.",
