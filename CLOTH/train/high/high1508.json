    "article": "The universities are schools of education and research but the main reason for their existence is not in the knowledge taught to the students or in the opportunities for the economic or social  _  resulting from the research findings. The true function of a university is that it keeps the  _  between knowledge and the real life. It unites the students with ordinary life in a  _  way. The university passes on information, but it  _  the information imaginatively. Imagination is the driving force for the society's future development. Students' imagination is the very  _  every university should protect and encourage. A university which  _  to do so has no reason for existence. With imagination, knowledge is not only knowledge: it includes all possibilities. It's no longer a  _  on students' memory. It's food for thought and  _  for creative inventions. Imagination is not  separate from  knowledge. Instead, it is a way leading to more knowledge. It works by thoroughly studying the current knowledge and then exploring every possibility about the knowledge. In the exploration, new knowledge  takes shape  . Imagination enables men to construct a new vision of the world and it adds  _  to life through endless possibilities. Imaginative people are restless all along. Youth is imaginative and if the university can help preserve this precious wealth, the power of imagination can  _  change the world. Besides, it should also be made clear that imagination won't be most effective without necessary experience. The problem of the current world is that those who are imaginative have only little experience  _  those who are experienced have weak imaginations. The  _  left for the universities is to hold together these two factors for the whole human race to  _  greater development and happiness.",
