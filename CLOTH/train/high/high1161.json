A school is being 18 set up  in New Jersey, USA. It is called Bancroft. Here the disabled will be trained to   _   themselves and to get along in the outside world. Bancroft is not surrounded by walls of any kind. Its director insists that it be   _   so that students may gradually develop   _   relations with the rest of the world. Bancroft students will 22 _  in apartments, cooking their own meals, and learning to perform other  _  . As they become able, they will buy their own furniture,   _   for it out of their own money. They will pay for their food, too. They will learn to expect   _   bills for the calls they make every month. As a step toward the goal of becoming   _  , each disabled person will decide what kind of work he wants to be   _   to do. While some of the training will be carried on within Bancroft itself, most of the students will receive  _   training in nearby towns. They will be trained by town people. After the training has been   _   completed, the student will work   _   an assistant and will begin to earn money. After that he will leave Bancroft,   _   the school will continue to give him help if he   _   it. How long will it take a student to   _   his training under this new system?

Many will learn to be useful and independent, supporting themselves in the world.",
