My big family always  _  presents together at the start of the New Year and have done so in this way for more than 40 years. Since the beginning, my grandfather and grandmother have  _  their children and cousins on this day in their small farmhouse.

I don't have to have it. I have other toys I can play with at home.\" Tears were welling up in my eyes! I was moved by this huge act of  _  . I was so  _  of my nephew and what he had done when he thought no one else was looking. I gave him a huge  _  and told him that he had demonstrated the true  _  of Christmas!",
