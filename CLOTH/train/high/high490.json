    "article": "A newly trained teacher named Molly went to teach at a Navajo Indian reservation. Every day, she would ask five of the young Navajo students to   go to  the\nchalkboard and complete a simple math problem from  their  homework.\nThey would stand there, silently,  _  to complete the task. Molly couldn't figure it out.\n  _  she had studied in her educational curriculum helped, and she  _  hadn't seen anything like it in her\nstudent-teaching days back in Phoenix. \nWhat am I doing wrong? Could I have chosen five students who can't do the  _  ? Molly would wonder. No,  _    couldn't be that. Finally she  _  the students what was wrong. And in their answers, she learned a  _  lesson from her young  _  pupils about self-image and a(n)  _  of self-worth.\nIt seemed that the students  _  each\nother's individuality and knew that  not all  of them were capable\nof doing the problems.  Even  at their early age, they understood the senselessness of the win-lose approach in the classroom. They believed no one would  _  if any students were shown up\nor embarrassed at the  _  . So they  _  to compete with each other in public. \nOnce she understood, Molly changed the system   so that  she could check each child's math problem individually, but not at any\nchild's expense  in front of  his classmates. They all wanted to learn,  _  not at someone else's expense.",
