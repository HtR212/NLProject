We lay down in his little bed and he said,\"Daddy, when I get big can I live with you?\"I42 _ him he could live with me any time he wanted to.\nA moment later he said,\"When you die you're going to feel43 _ on your face and it will be me touching you.\"Then he44 _ ,\"I will kiss you.\"He moved over, kissed me. I was aware of tears suddenly welling up in my eyes. I didn't want to explain45 _ I was crying; as I opened my eyes to look at him, he was already46 _ .\nI spent some time looking at him,47 _ the minute and wondering about the depth of the48 _ I'd had. It occurred to me that I didn't remember having much of this kind of49 _ time with my father, and that this was a time that would be50 _ short-lived. This time of51 _ that forms a three-year-old's life, would soon be52 _ . What will remain, however, will be the53 _ of this short while reoccurring in my mind non-stop. It made all of the difficult54 _ of being a father worthwhile.\nSometimes, being a committed father can feel like you're55 _ the doorkeeper, driver, and56 _ in the house. Then you will have\"a57 _ \", one like this in which your child expresses  , pure, and58 _ love for you.\nWhen your kids have59 _ home and you look back at these years, all of these will be strung together to60 make up the memories of their lives with you.",
