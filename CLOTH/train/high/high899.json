    "article": "The most important lesson I learned in high school had nothing to do with maths or American history. It came at graduation, several minutes before I left Miramonte High School.\nI was rather shy back then, content to   _   around with my few friends and to concentrate on my   _   I was doing so well that by the end of senior year I had perfect scores and enough   _   to go to college.\nBut my good record soon became a   _   to my well-being. In early June of senior year, the headmaster called me into his office. He asked me to give a leave-taking speech at graduation. I looked at him, my heart   _   fast. This was the   _   for my hard work? I said something, but not very clearly, and hurried away from the office.\nI was   _   about the decision, finally agreeing to compromise. I wasn't the only speaker -- I would   _   the honor with five other students. Still, it was doubtful whether the task was   _   me. How in the world would I give a speech to hundreds of people?\nGraduation day soon arrived and, as   _  , I was nervous. I'd been practicing my speech for days, and I had it   _  . But I had never been so 52 _  in my life. The first half hour of the ceremony passed, and then my   _   came. My name was announced. I managed to reach the platform without falling down. But within minutes, I finished my speech,   _  back to my seat and feeling unsatisfied with my performance.\nNow I still have the   _   of that speech. My voice trembled a little, but   _   it was clear and strong. I'm proud of that tape. I achieved something I'd never   _  -- I spoke in front of hundreds of people.   _   I didn't realize it at the time, the successful completion of that speech gave me the   _   to participate in class at college, to give oral reports, and to eventually break free of my   _  .\nI never would have chosen to give a speech at graduation. But I am glad I did. I know it may well turn out to be one of my shining moments.",
