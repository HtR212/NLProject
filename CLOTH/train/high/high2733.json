I was a ticket-counter supervisor for a major airline and was looking forward to the  _  of my shift at Stapleton International Airport in Denver. My wife was waiting up for me at home so that we could  _  our gifts for Christmas. Just then, a very  _  gentleman went up to me. He asked how he could get to Cheyenne, Wyoming. He had just arrived from Philadelphia and  _  his connecting flight. I pointed him to the ground transportation area, where he could rent a  _  . And then I called my wife to let her know I would be home  _  . About fifteen minutes later, the gentleman  _  and informed me that all the buses were full and there were no cars  _  . I told him that he had to stay for a night at the airport. Hearing that, he burst into  _  . I tried to make him calm down. He explained that his name was Tom, and that his only son was  _  ill at home and was not expected to  _  another year. He expected that this would likely be the  _  Christmas with his son. I told Tom to  _  his luggage and wait for me at the gate. I was driving to Cheyenne. I called my wife Kathy, telling her about it and not to wait up for me. I drove fast  all the way  and we arrived in Cheyenne around 2:30 a. m. Kathy was still  waiting for  me when I got home in the early morning. We traded gifts and then our conversation  _  Tom. For Kathy and me, there was no  _  that driving Tom to Cheyenne was the  _  choice. A couple of days later, I  _  a Christmas card with a picture of Tom and his family. In it, Tom thanked me for the special  _  he had received that holiday season, but I knew the best gift was mine.",
