Apart form the people   _  , almost everybody else was on their phones, and because of the nature of the tube, it is difficult not to see   _   what they are all doing. Of course, being   _   it is difficult to get any signal, which rules out texting or using the Internet,   _   there is still plenty you can use your phones for. People were playing   _  , reading articles and listening to music, and I'm sure that as soon as they   _   from the train station they would start texting or calling or checking their emails.

I loved being free from the Internet, and I really didn't mind not having constant   _   about what my friends were doing or what the latest celebrity story was.
