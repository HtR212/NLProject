Then something  _  happened. One of our friends suffered from kidney stones , which had to be  _  surgically as soon as possible. But it was not as  _  as that! Our friend could not  _  the operation, which put him into dee  _  . I didn't know how to help him because I didn't have any money either.  _  , I never lost hope. Instead I tried to think of other  _  and told him not to worry because everything would be all right.

Well, I must have been  _  because the surgeon agreed to do it! But how was I going to get that much money? All I knew was that I needed to help my friend! Although it could be  _  to deal with this kind of situation, I decided to make some efforts. I tried to borrow money but failed. I tried  _  my things but no one wanted them. Then I had the idea of talking to my  _  . I asked him if I could have my next two months' salary in advance--without even thinking on how I would  _  for two months with no money.

Upon getting the money, I ran to the hospital and paid all the bills. My friend didn't know how to thank me. I just said, \"Come on! Give me a  _  !\" Friendship may not only be found at the happy moment but sometimes you can find it on the  _  time in your life!
