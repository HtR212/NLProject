The son, in a spirit of  _  , picked up some small pebbles and said, \"I will put these in the old fellow's shoes, and it'll be great fun when he tries to put them on.\" \"I  _  if you will get much fun out of that,\" said the father, \"  _  from his clothes, he must be a poor man. And his life is hard. Would there be fun in  adding to  his troubles? If you were to surprise him in a  _  way, say by putting a coin in each shoe, you would probably enjoy more.\" The boy adopted the  _  of his father and slipped a silver coin into each shoe. Then they hid behind a tree to watch the  _  of their trick. After a while, the old man came back to his work and slipped his right foot into his shoe.  _  something hard in the shoe he  _  his foot to see what was inside. He discovered the coin. A(n)  _  look came over his face. He turned the coin over and over in his hand, and gazed at it in astonishment. As he looked at it, he felt with his foot for the other shoe, which also held a coin. Then  _  clasping his hands together, he fell upon his  _  and prayed.

Of all the pleasures of life, those that are expressed by tears rather than laughter are the most blessed\".",
