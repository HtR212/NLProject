She used to be an engineer, and she should understand better than I how flight is   _   a simple physics equation . It definitely wasn't   _  .\nBut now, I   _   she was at least partially right.   While   flying might not be magic, it's certainly magical. I read a sentence a few months ago,   saying  ,\"you know you're grown-up when you no longer want a   _   seat.\" Too often in   _   years, I've found myself   asking for   a seat on the exit row, forgetting the wonders outside the window.\nI think of one time   _   I was leaving on a business trip. Moments after take-off, I started working on my computer. But a passenger behind me wouldn't stop talking. \"The clouds!\" he kept saying, \"Look at the clouds!\"\nI   turned around  , and saw two men, one who appeared to be in his 70s and   the other   much younger. The chatter continued for 20 minutes until, in frustration, I looked up from my computer screen and opened the window   _  .\nThe clouds!\nHe was right. We were   _   through giant balls of cotton, soft and fluffy , seemly   _   enough to touch. The afternoon sun   _   a11 kinds of colors: pink, red and ivory, all   _   a blue sky. I closed my laptop and   _   at them for the rest of the flight.\nI don't remember the   _   I felt like I had to complete that afternoon. But I've never forgotten those   _  .",
