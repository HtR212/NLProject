I stood at my window, staring at the boat. Then I lost  _  of her, an old light-house partly blocked my view of the harbor. A dozen passengers were  _  their way there. I was about to join them --- when a man's face  _  at the light-house window. This was strange, because the light-house had been empty, unused and  _  for thirty years. It was stranger still --- because I'd seen that  _  before. I couldn't place it but it was, or had once been, familiar to me. I opened my window and  _  across. \"I know we've met before, but I can't remember where.\" I  _  him to open his if he could and answer me. He did neither. The face behind the glass  _  motionless . Seeing him more clearly now, I knew he was not looking at me. He seemed to be looking upwards,  _  the clouds. How well I'd known that face, sometime, somewhere! I  _  again. \"We met years ago. Was it in Athens in the 1950s? I used to live in Plaka.\" He didn't reply nor give any  _  that he'd heard. I went back further, to  _  I was in the navy. \"Perhaps we met at sea during the war,\" and that thought at once  _  him to mind. Commander Leftis! He was Commander Leftis of course! How could I have forgotten? I'd saved his life once. But surely he ... The motor-boat  rang  her bell. I turned my eyes. The wind had risen, but she was pulling  _  . Laughing, I called, \"Now I've missed her, and it's your  _  , Commander!\" As the boat drew away, the face at the window faded.  _  minute it was there. Looking up, I could see the whites of the eyes. The  _  minute it was gone. Well, I didn't rush to the light-house. I knew that Leftis was dead. He died at sea in 1963 or 1964. But there's one other thing I ought to tell you: the motor-boat never reached Miros. It was lost in a storm, with all the passengers.",
