    "article": "Many kids think that class and learning is boring. It is especially   _  for teachers to try to make learning fun. There are certain   _  that you also would assume kids would   _  find interesting. One of them is first aid. Many kids probably think first aid lesson is   _  . But first aid is an important skill for anyone to learn, including children. So how can a teacher make learning about first aid interesting? \nOne way to do so is to get the children   _  . Have them compete to bandage or care for one of their friends. Tell the children that their friend has cuts all over his body and that he needs to be   _  for. This can create a very fun situation where one child is covered in bandages. \nSet up a   _  where the children find one of their friends unconscious. Have one child play the unconscious friend. Have the children call 911 on a play phone and   _  to see if there is a heart rate or breathing. See how quickly they can do all of the necessary tasks and 9 _ them to other groups of children. Make the whole day into a competition with some sort of      _  for the child or group of children that do the best. \nAnother way to make first aid training   _  is to have the kids tell stories about scary times when they thought someone needed first aid. This is a good   _  because with the children's new learning they can figure out how best to help the person in their story. These sorts of   _  will make first aid learning time fun and exciting. The kids will remember the day when you taught them first aid with fondness,   _   that they will remember what you taught them. Who knows, maybe by making first aid fun you could help to  _  a life.",
