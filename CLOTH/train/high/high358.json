    "article": "The story of \"Making Pancakes\" reminds me of Mother's Day in Georgia in 1970. That  _  ,my family and I were at the Church  _  for the preacher  to begin when I looked around noticing our 12-year-old son was  _  . My wife and I looked at each other with  _  eyes, thinking he was  _  outside playing with his friends.\nThirty minutes later the preacher was well into his sermon   and  _  no son.Since we only  _  about a block from the Church,all through the sermon I was  _  he had gone home to watch television.  As soon as  the preacher finished hissermon,my wife and I rushed for the door. With  _  building with every step I took toward the house,I  _  what I would say and what I would do as soon as we found him.\nWith all that tension and anxiety  _  ,can you imagine our surprise when we walked into the house and found him sitting on the sofa waiting for us with a(an)  _  ? I was just about to let it all  _  ,when without saying a word he stood, took his mother by the hand,and  _  her into the kitchen.\nThere before us was a  _  table of food spread our 12-year-old son had  _  for my wife as his Mother's Day gift with his smile.Later,we learned he left  _  after Sunday School to rush home to have it ready for his mom.\nIn our life,we often look at our circumstances and think how  _  things are.  Then when we see the  _   of the cases,wecan only bow our humble  heads in amazement at how things turned out for our good!",
