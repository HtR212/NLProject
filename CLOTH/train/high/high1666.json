I invented the light bulb. It just  _  to be a 2000-step process.\" Rudolph was born prematurely and her  _  was doubtful. At age 4, she had a high fever,  _  her with a paralyzed leg. At age 9, she removed the metal leg brace she had  _  on and began to walk without it. By 13 she had developed a rhythmic walk, which doctors said was a  _  . For the next few years she  _  one race after another but always came in last. Everyone told her to  _  , but she kept on running. One day she actually won a race. And then another.  _  this little girl, who was told she would never walk again, went on to win three Olympic gold medals. When Bell invented the telephone in 1876, President Rutherford said, \"That's an  _  invention, but who would ever want to use one of them?\" In the 1940s, another young  _  named Carlson took his idea to 20 corporations,  _  some of the biggest in the country. They all turned him down. In 1947 -- after seven long years of rejections! - He  _  got a tiny company in New York, the Haloid Company, to  _  the rights to his invention. Haloid became Xerox Corporation we know today. Character cannot be  _  in ease and quiet. Only  through  experiences of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, vision cleared, ambition inspired and success  _  . You gain strength, experience and confidence by every experience  _  you really stop to look fear in the face.... You must do the thing you cannot do. And remember, the finest steel gets sent through the hottest furnace . A  _  is not one who never fails, but one who NEVER QUITS!",
