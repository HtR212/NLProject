In order not to appear  _  , she went along. As they sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too  _  to say anything and she felt uncomfortable. Suddenly, he asked the waiter, \"Could you please give me some  _  ? I'd like to put it in my coffee.\" They stared at him. He turned  _  , but when the salt came, he put it in his coffee and drank.  _  , she asked, \"Why salt with coffee?\" He explained, \"When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea. I liked playing on the sea ... I could feel its taste salty, like salty coffee. Now  every time  I drink it, I think of my childhood and my hometown. I  _  it and my parents, who are still there.\" She was deeply touched. A man who can admit that he's homesick must love his home and  care about  his family. He must be responsible. She talked too, about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was the start to their love story. They continued to  _  . She found that he met all her  _  . He was tolerant, kind, warm and careful. She would have missed the catch if not for the salty coffee! So they  _  and lived happily together. And every time she made  _  for him, she put in some salt, the way he liked it. After 40 years, he passed away and left her a letter which said: My dearest, please  _  my life-long lie. Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous I asked for salt instead of  _  . It was hard for me to ask for a  _  , so I just went ahead. Many times, I tried to tell you the truth, but I was afraid that it would  _  everything. Sweetheart, I don't exactly like salty coffee. But as it  _  so much to you, I've learnt to enjoy it. Having you  _  me was my greatest happiness. If I could live a second time, I hope we can be together again,  even if  it means that I have to drink salty coffee for the rest of my life.",
