    "article": "In my class, there was a really weak-looking guy. I don't    _   know if his name was Vit or Wit. I will   refer to   him as Wit in this story of mine. He was a pale, thin guy. Not only his build looked weak, the way he    _   was also weak. He walked slowly but he tried to stay off of everyone's way. The friends in my class, Jean and Ingrid,  would   make fun of   him. Truth to be told,   I   _     them as well. We did things like taking his stuff, like his pens and pencils, and   _   them somewhere in the school.\nWit was also really   _   of insects, even butterfly. Jean, Ingrid, and I often put beetle on his clothes and he would run around, trying to   _   it off. There were many beetles in the school so that was the   _   insect we used to scare him with. Other insects such as butterfly were hard to   _   so we pretty much gave up on it. We would often take the   _  when Wit was off-guard and put the insects on him.   _     it was on him, he would run around or jump about. He was too scared to   _   it and pull it off.\nSuddenly one day, we were   called in   by the school. When I walked into the room, Wit's mother, as well as Ingrid's mother, Jean's father, and mine were 45 _  in the room silently. Wit's mother said that Wit went home and     _   the sandbag shouting \"Jean!!! Ingrid!!! Archer!!!\"  _   every day. I wanted to laugh but didn't with all the   _   she was putting on us .She asked many things, including things I had no idea about such as \"Who put Wit's bag in the girl toilet?\" Apparently, it was Jean who did it. Jean seemed to have bullied Wit quite a lot and got quite a(n)   _   from Wit's and her own mother.\nI think it should have been quite guilty for   _   to see us scolded by the parents. However , we decided to stop bullying Wit and be friendly to him.",
