    "article": "Recently, a professor of philosophy in the United States has written a book called Money and the Meaning of Life. He has   _  that how we deal with\nmoney in our day-to-day life has more meaning than we usually  _  . One of the exercises he has asked his students to do is keep a  _  of every penny they spend for a week. From the  _  they spend their money, they can see what they really  _  in life.\n    The professor says our   _  with others often becomes clearly defined when money enters the\npicture. You  should  have wonderful friendship with\nsomebody and you think that you are very good friends. But you will know him\nonly when you ask him to lend you some  _  . If he does, it brings\nsomething to the relationship that seems  _  than\never before.  _  it can suddenly weaken the\nrelationship if he doesn't.\n    Since money is so important to us, we consider those who are   _  to\nbe very important. The professor  _  some rich people\nin researching his book.\n    Question: What is the most   _  thing you have discovered about being\nrich?\n    Answer: The most surprising thing is why people give me so much   _  . I\nam nothing. I don't know much. All I am is rich.\nPeople just have an idea of making more and more money, but what is it   _  ?\nHow much money do I need for any given  _  in my\nlife? In his book, the professor uncovered an important  _  in modern society: to bring back the idea that the money is an\ninstrument  _  than the end. Money plays an\nimportant  _  in the material world, but  _  money to give happiness may be missing the meaning of life.",
