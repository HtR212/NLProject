They   _   there and the wise man told one of his students, \" I am   _  . Get me some water from the lake there.\"\nThe student   _   up to the lake. When he reached it, he   _   that some people were   _   clothes in the water, and, right at that moment, a cart   started   _   the lake. As a result, the water became very   _  . The student thought, \" How can I give this muddy water to my teacher to drink!\" So he   went back   and told the wise man, \" The water there is very muddy. I don't think it is   _   to drink.\"\nAfter about half an hour, again the wise man asked the   _   student to go back to the lake and get him some water to drink. The student obediently   went back to the lake. This time he found that the lake had  ly   _   water in it. The mud had settled down and the water above it looked fit to drink. So he   _   some water in a pot and took it to his teacher.\nThe wise man looked at the water, and then he looked up at the student and said, \" See   _   you did to make the water clean. You let it be ... and the mud   settled down   on its own --- and you got clear water... Your mind is also like that. When it is   _  , just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle down on its own. You don't have to   put in   any effort to calm it down. It will happen. It is effortless.\"\nWhat did the wise man   _   here? He said, \" It is effortless.\"   _   peace of mind is effortless process. When there is peace inside you, that   _   permeates   to the outside. It   _   around you and in the environment, so that people around start feeling that peace and grace.",
