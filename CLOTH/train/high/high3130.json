He passed each grade with great  _  ,\nnever at the top of his class.\nHow I   _  friends\nwho had children with the \"math gene\".A mom told me her daughter was doing high school algebra while in the sixth grade.Another mom said her son had just taken first place in the district' s annual Math Challenge.\nAfter hearing these stories, I would look at Joe and   _  : Why didn't we raise a\nmathematical talent? How is he ever going to get into  _  if\nhe does not get better at math? Needless to say, my motherly  _  never really amounted to much.Does it ever? Moms tend to worry and worry, while whatever they' re worrying about usually   _  on its own.\nDuring high school, Joe slowly  _  at math.He got through algebra I & II, and geometry, our state requirements for math.I felt greatly   _  at\nhis little achievement.Then he announced that he' d take pre - calculus   in his last year of high school, which   _  me a lot.\n         \"Why?\" I questioned.\n\" Because I need to keep my skills up,\" he explained.\" I   _  math,\nbut I need to take it so I don' t forget how to do it.\"\n\"For college, \" he added.\"I want to do really well in college, Mom.I know it will be  _  , but I think it' s\nimportant that I try to do my best.\"\nMy oldest son wasn't perfect.He wasn't a math talent, either.But he knew what was important: he was focusing on his  _  while I was worrying over his past.And that, to me, is even better than being  _  .",
