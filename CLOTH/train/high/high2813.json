If your child is a natural athlete or  _  lover, he or she is probably already active and  _  easy to get moving. But if, like me, you are the parent of a junior sofa potato, complete with a(n)  video-game  controller in one hand and a bag of potato chips in the other, you know what it is like to have your  _  to go outside to play met with, at best, silence or at worst, cry and  _  . If logic, threats and lectures on health don't work, turn to  _  : trick him or her into liking by making it into fun.  _  enjoyment, not pressure or physical fitness or anything that seems to be \"good for you\". That is where the dancing and nature walks  come in  . Health experts say that the answer to the question, \"Which type of exercise is best for my child?\" is \"Whichever one he or she likes best.\" It doesn't have to be swimming or soccer or gymnastics.  _  play, especially with the rest of the family, will  _  the body's requirements for regular aerobic movement just well, and won't ever seem like exercising.  For example  , if nature is an interest, walk vigorously around finding every leaf, insect, and  _  print in the park. If rock radio is the station of choice,  _  to the music. Get the family members playing catch, touch football together. Organize a(n)  _  science group to walk around your neighborhood and pick your rubbish. Make every trip to the pool an excuse for playing games in the water together. Remember that the goal is to set a pattern for lifelong fitness. And if you don't make it  _  , kids are never going to keep it up.",
