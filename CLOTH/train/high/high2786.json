    "article": "I lived in America with my teenage son Karl. After his father died, Karl became very shy, quite and only concerned about his own thoughts. As a   _  parent,\nI tried to do my best to talk to him. But the more I tried, the more\nhe  pulled away  . When his report card arrived during\nhis third year , it said that he had been  _  95\ntimes from classes and had six  _  grades for the\nyear. At this rate he would never  _  . I sent him to the school\nadviser, and I even begged him.  _  worked.\nOne night I felt so powerless that I got down    _  my knees\nand pleaded for help. \"Please God, I can't do anything more for my son.\nI'm at the end of my rope. I'm giving the whole thing up to  _  .\"\nOne day, I was at work when I got a (an)  phone call  . A man introduced\nhimself as the headmaster. \"I want to talk to you about Karl's absence\n.\"  _  he could say another word, I was very\nupset and all my  _  and sadness over Karl came  pouring out  into\nthe ears of this stranger. \" I do  _  my son\nbut I just don't know what to do. I've tried everything to get Karl to go back\nto school and nothing has worked. It's out of my  _  .\n\"For a moment there was (a)  _  on the other end of the line.\nThe headmaster seriously said, \"Thank you for your time\", and hung\nup.\nKarl's next report card showed an obvious    _  in his grades.\nFinally, he even made the honor roll. In his  _  year, I\nattended a parent-teacher meeting with Karl. I noticed that his  _  were\nastonished at the way he had turned himself around. On our way home, he said,\n\"Mum,  _  that call from the headmaster last year?\" I\nnodded. \"That was me. I thought I'd play a joke but when I heard what you said,\nit really hit me how much I was hurting you. That's  _  I\nknew I had to make you proud. \"",
