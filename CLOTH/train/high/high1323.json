You might not ever talk about anything serious with them but they are there.\nA classmate from twenty years ago was one of my Facebook friends. A few random comments he   _   gave me the impression that something was   _   so I tried to make him call me. He did call and I found out that he, his wife and eight children had just moved into a(n)   _  motel room. He had used the very last of their money to pay for a week's   _   there. He had no job and they had lost their   _  .\nI bought a few groceries and took them to the motel room. After the visit I   _  to do something a bit extreme. I messaged all of our mutual Facebook friends from our graduating class. What happened next was just   _  . Soon I was getting responses. Classmates, some of whom had   _   been barely friendly started calling me for information or sending donations for the family.\nSomeone told me they knew someone else in a nearby town with a(n)   _  house. The home owners donated the house rent free, only asking them to   _   the fees of water and electricity and mow   the lawn when it was needed. Soon this family had volunteers from our class delivering furniture, groceries, toys, even job   _  !\nThere are still many things we are   _   for this family. They have yet to get a vehicle for work and he hasn't found a job, but everyone is   _   smiles now. And, let me tell you, the hugs from his lovely children speak louder than any words ever could!\nI became the   _   between this family's needs and people who could help them. It still amazes me how wonderfully it all   worked out  , just because of me and my Facebook friends!",
