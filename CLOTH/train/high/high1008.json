    "article": "A   _  thing happened  _  me last Sunday. It was\nsuch a beautiful day  _  I drove to go for a look\nin the country. On the way back home, my  _  stopped.\nIt was out of gas on a  _  road far from a town! I\ndecided to walk until I found someone  _  could\nsell some gas. I had walked almost a mile  _  I\nfinally found a house near the  _  . I was glad\nto see it because it was getting dark.\n I knocked at the door and a little old lady with long white hair\n  _  . She said, \"I've been   _   for you here for a long time. Come in.  _  is almost ready.\"\n \"But I only came for some gas,\" I answered. I couldn't   _  what she was talking about.\n \"Oh!Alfred! Gas? You   used to  like tea,\" said she.\nI quickly  _  that my car was out of  _  . But she didn't seem\nto listen to me. She just kept  calling  me Alfred and\ntalking about how long it had been since she had seen me. She was acting very\nstrangely and I was  _  to leave. As soon as she\nwent to get tea, I went out of the house as fast as I  _  .\n Fortunately, there was another house down the road and I was able to buy the gas I needed. When I told the man about my   _  , he said, \"Oh,\nthat's Miss Emily. She lives by herself in that big house. She's strange, but\nshe wouldn't  _  anybody. She is still waiting for the\nman she was going to marry thirty years ago. The day before their wedding,he left home and never came back because of the war.\"",
