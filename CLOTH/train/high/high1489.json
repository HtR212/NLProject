    "article": "Thanks to a combination of young businessmen, large numbers of university students and revitalization efforts by the local and national governments, today's Nanjing has an  _  of youthful exuberance that would have been  _  only a few decades ago.  _  , the city, a booming city of 6.5 million on the banks of the Yangtze River some 185 miles west of Shanghai, bears  _  resemblance to the former capital of China that suffered the worst cruelty and violence of World War II.  _  Nanjing has shown a remarkable capacity for reinvention during its 2,500-year history. And in recent years, the city has moved  _  its tragic past to become a vital engine of China's economic growth, thanks  in part  to its position in the middle of China's prosperous eastern seaboard. Growth has also  _  thanks to improved ground transportation: A new bullet train linking Nanjing and Shanghai started service last year,  _  travel time between the cities from several hours to just 75 minutes, and a Beijing-Shanghai high-speed line is  _  to open later this year, with a stop in Nanjing. Within the city, two metro lines were built in the last few years; 15 more are planned to begin service by 2030. Signs of Nanjing's  _  wealth and optimism can be seen everywhere. In the heart of the downtown Xinjiekou district, a bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen,  _  the father of modern China, looks  _  over a busy  _  area. There is perhaps no more  _  symbol of the city's transformation than the Zifeng Tower, a 1,480-foot skyscraper that opened its doors last May.  _  offices, restaurants and an InterContinental hotel, the tower is the second-tallest building in China and billed as the seventh-tallest in the world. Underlying all this development is a large Chinese and  _  student population -- there are several major universities, plus a branch of Johns Hopkins's international studies school. In fact, art and music  spring up  in all sorts of places. On a larger  _  , local government officials and private investors are pushing the city as a rising center for contemporary art and architecture, hoping to attract  _  from the neon-bathed streets of its neighbor Shanghai.",
