    "article": "I read a piece of news today that the richest people were paying 736, 000 dollars for watches at present. As I was   _   my head at their craziness, I glanced at my own 8-dollar watch. It told me the time just fine. I guessed that about 735, 992 dollars were   left over   from buying such a cheap watch. With that I could send 18 kids to college for four years each with the room, board, and books included. With that I could sponsor   _   200 needy children overseas into adulthood. With that I could buy   _   for 2.5 million starving people around the world. With that money I could do so much good, help so many souls, and still know the   _   whenever I looked down at my wrist.\nWhen did our society become so   _   that anyone would think they needed a 736, 000-dollar watch? When did people become so   _   that they would believe a one-million-dollar   _   is essential? My first car cost me only 500 dollars and it still gets me where I need to go. When did 50-million-dollar yachts   and 100-million-dollar houses become so  _   to a person's happiness? My tiny home has more 25 _  in it than the biggest mansion in the world and I can walk on the shore of the local lake here and   _   its beauty for free.\nI pray that at some point our society says \"Enough!\" and   wakes up   from this horrible dream of materialism. Each of us only has one life. Let's not   _   it on the watches we wear and the cars we drive. Each of us only has one soul. Let's not   _   it trying to gain the whole world. Life puts us here to love each other and to make this world a better place. Help others whenever you can. Life is brief and no watch will sell a(n)  _   second of it to you.",
