    "article": "A special lady lived on a farm in Grace, Idaho. To overcome every 41 _  or struggle that came her way, she went far beyond the call of duty. She was a widow   with 9 children. Instead\nof 42 _  of her hard life, she accepted her fate   and 43 _  the ordinary into the extraordinary.\nNo matter how serious things seemed to be, she found a(n) 44 _  side and a ray of hope. She taught her family the 45 _  of hard work and the importance of education, 46 _  she only went as far as fourth grade.\nHer children didn't have material 47 _ , but they certainly received the necessary and 48 _  things in life: love, spiritual guidance, concern for others, appreciation for a table filled with food,and 49 _  for the law. She was truly a(n) 50 _  of all that is good.\n I remember as a young man sitting at her feet while she 51 _  me. \"If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.\" And she said, \"I'll 52 _  throw upon the floor a crust   I cannot eat, for many a hungry one would think it quite a 53 _ . Willful waste brings willful want, and I may live to say, 'Oh, I wish I had that crust that once I 54 threw away .'\"\nThis extremely courageous and 55 _  woman is my grandmother. My mother is a lot like her mother. Many times, my mother went 56 _  a new dress just so we could buy some great football shoes. Many times, my mother 57 _ \n that we should stay home instead of going on a summer vacation, just so we could 58 _  on a baseball all-star team. My mother is the greatest cook on Earth, a spiritual 59 _ , a church and community servant, and the very best mom who ever lived. I've never 60 _  her complain about her difficulties, heartache, and pain. My dear, sweet mother truly is a perfect example. It's the way it was and still should be.",
