    "article": "We took the bus from the suburb every early morning that summer 3 years ago. One of the passengers was a small  _  man who took the bus to the centre for senior citizens every morning. He walked with a stoop and a sad look on his face when he, with some difficulty,  _  the bus and sat down alone behind the driver. No one ever paid very much attention to him. Then one  _  morning he said good morning to the driver and smiled before he sat down. The driver  _  guardedly. The rest of us were silent. The next day, the old man boarded the bus energetically,  _  and said in a loud voice: \"And a very good morning to you all!\" Some of us looked up, amazed, and murmured \"Good morning,\"  in reply  . The following weeks we were more alert . Our friend was now dressed in a nice old suit and a wide out-of-date  _  . The thin hair had been carefully combed. He said good morning to us every day and we  _  began to nod and talk to each other. One morning he had a bunch of wild flowers in his hand. The driver  turned around  smilingly and asked:\"Have you got yourself a girlfriend, Charlie?\"and he nodded shyly and said yes. The other passengers  _  and clapped at him. Charlie bowed and waved the  _  before he sat down on his seat. Every morning after that Charlie always brought a flower. Some of the  _  passengers began bringing him flowers for his bouquet . The summer went by, and  _  was closing in, when one morning Charlie wasn't waiting at his usual  _  . When he wasn't there the next day and the day after that, we started wondering if he was sick or --  _  -- on holiday somewhere. One day, we learned from the staff working in the centre for senior citizens that the elderly  _  was fine, but he hadn't been coming to the  _  that week. One of his very close friends had died at the weekend. They  _  him back on Monday. How silent we were the rest of the way to work. The next  _  Charlie was waiting at the stop, stooping a bit more, a little bit more grey, and without a tie. He seemed to have shrinked again. Inside the bus was a  _  . All of us sat with our eyes filled with tears and a bunch of wild flowers in our hands.",
