You   _   me so many things about the world and myself. You were the first ones to tell me about the importance of   _   by telling me it was    _   to refuse all my other playmates from using my toys. And to this day,   _   those toys are long gone,  I   _   to live by the idea of sharing my blessings   with the people   _   me.\nMom and Dad, you also   _   me to be sympathetic   towards the blind old man. You told me that our pets are there for us to   look after   and not to hurt. And because of those   _  , I've learnt to be   _  .\nThank you, Mom and Dad. You gave me some of the nicest   _  . Mom, I remember how you would let me sleep in your bed   _   how you used to bring me my favorite fried chicken and take care of me whenever I was   _  . Dad, I remember how you worked   _   to make me a playhouse in the yard so my friends and I could   _   happily there. \nI may have   _   you and your purposes when I was much younger. But now I know that   _  you did was for my own good.\nMom and Dad, I hope this thank-you   _   is enough to let you know how much I   _  everything you've done for me.\nAll the love, \nRex",
