    "article": "One day, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I discovered that I had about 500 pounds of bircks left over!  Rather than  carry the bricks down by hand I decided to lower them by a pulley , which fortunately was  _  to the side of the building on the sixth floor. Fastening the rope at the ground level, I went up to the roof and  _  the bricks into a barrel . Then I went back to the  _  and untied the rope,  _  it tightly to insure a  _  fall of the 500 punds of bricks. You know, I only weighed 135 pounds. Due to my  _  at being pulled off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and  _  to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I went on at a rather  _  rate up the building. Near the third floor, I met the barrel  coming down  , which made my collarbone broken,  _  only slightly, I didn't stop. At approximately the same time, the barrel  _  the ground, and the bottom fell out of the barrel.  _  the bricks, the barrel now weighed about 50 pounds. I refer you again to my weight of 135 pounds.  _  you might imagine, I began a rapid down. Also near the  _  floor, I met the barrel coming up, which made my legs broken. The encounter with the  _  slowed me enough to reduce my  _  when I fell onto the pile of bricks, and  _  , only three vertebrae were broken. However, as I  _  there on the bricks in pain, unable to move, and  _  the barrel six stories above, I again lost my presence of mind. I let go of the rope!",
