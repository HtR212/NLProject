The students were sixteen or seventeen years old,  _  several years younger than me.  In fact  , some of them looked and acted  _  older than me sometimes. The room was directly  _  the street, and had the window looking out over the street and many houses. One day, I was  _  some words on the blackboard when I heard a sudden change in the noise behind me. There was a man standing in the room with  _  an apple in his hand. He looked  _  . \"Who threw this?\" he asked, looking round the class. \"I beg your pardon? What is the matter?\" I said. \"  _  threw this apple out of the window,\" he said. \"It  _  on my car.\" \"Who threw an apple out of the window?\" I  _  to the class. There was no answer. \"I  _  the fellow who threw this.\" said the man. \"I will be  _  outside for you.\" And then he left, closing the door behind him.  _  was silence and I continued with the lesson.
