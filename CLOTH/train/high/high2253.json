    "article": "From the time each of my children started school, I packed their lunches. And in each lunch, I  _  a note. Often written on a napkin, it might be a thank-you for a  _  moment, a reminder of something we were happily expecting , or a bit of  _  for the coming test or sporting event. In early grade school they  _  their notes. But as children grow older they become self-conscious( ),and  by the time  he reached high school , my older son, Marc informed me he no longer  _  my daily notes. Telling him that he no longer needed to  _  them but I still needed to write them. I  continued  until the day he graduated. Six years after high school graduation , Marc called and asked if he could move  home  for a couple of months. He had spent those years well, graduating from college ,  _  two internships ( ) in Washington, D.C. , and  _  , becoming a technical assistant in Sacramento.  Except for  short vacation visits, however, he had lived away from home . With his younger sister leaving for college , I was  _  happy to have Marc back . Since I was  _  making lunch for his younger brother , I  _  one for Marc , too. Imagine my  _  when I got a call from my 24-year-old son,  asking about  his lunch. \"Did I do something  _  ?\" Don't you love me  any more  , Mom ?\" were just a few of the questions he threw at me as I  _  asked him what was wrong. \"My note, Mom .\" he answered . \" Where's my note?\"",
