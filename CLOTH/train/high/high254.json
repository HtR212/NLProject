    "article": "About five years ago my family moved to Iowa and I started going to a new school. I was a little   _  , but I worried I would never   fit in   with the other eleventh graders. Lucy, a girl in my class was not   _   for the change. I thought she didn't   _   me from the start. In fact, I was   _   that she hated me. When I asked her a   _  , she answered me impatiently as if I was a total   _  . My teacher made us   _   next to each other in the last semester. Lucy didn't like that   _  .I didn't wear make-up  , and I didn't   wear   those awesome   jeans everyone else was wearing. I didn't exactly   look like   the coolest girl. However, I kept smiling at her,   _   she rolled her eyes at me  . I kept telling her she looked   _  , even if she was angry.   _  , Lucy let me talk to her, even   in front of   her \"cool\" friends. She started   _   me how beautiful I looked. I still remember the first time when she   _   at me saying that, and I smiled right back, telling her a joke. Lucy   _   me to her house for parties, and talked to me all the time. Lucy, the girl who had   _   me, called me her best friend. I will never forget a   _   written by Abraham Lincoln: \"Am I not destroying   my enemies when I make friends of them?\"",
