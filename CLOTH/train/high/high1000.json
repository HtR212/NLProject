Some seemed a bit more45 _  , using the time to tell jokes. A few stared at the field,  46 _  what will happen in 120 minutes.\n    Our coach, Tony Severino, came out of his office at 6 o'clock.He told the team how 47 _  this game was for the season, between two of the state's top teams--my school and our opposing team, Liberty High School. His words gave the team impulse it needed to48 warm up .\n    At 7:10 pm, warm - ups finished, we went over the game  49 _ and discussed what we needed to do for the next three hours. The sound of the national anthem 50 _ that we were only minutes from the action.Our coach usually made a final 51 _ .But tonight was different.On this clear night he 52 _ looked around the room at all the players and shouted, \"Let's go and get them.\" Even 53 _  the \"get\" came out of his mouth, we were already 54 _ our way out of the door.\n    Outside, a few young fans reached to touch our hands, eager to be a 55 _  of our school's winning tradition.When I smiled and 56 held out my hand, the young faces lit up as if they had just met Superman.\n    Seconds later, the team ran onto the  57 _ , moving as a mass of blue, in front of a packed stadium. We enjoyed a noisy 58 _ from fans and the fight song played by our school band. Breathing in the  59 _ of one of the biggest games of the year, I felt we were sure to win. I told myself, \"This was what it was all about\" and60 _ that it was for moments like this that I loved high school football.",
