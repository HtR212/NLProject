    "article": "In a food store I heard a woman say her foot was hurting and that she was going to call a cab. When walking back home, I saw her outside the store, probably  _  for a cab.\nI asked her where she was going. She told me a place which was actually on the  _  to the craft store I'd be  _  to. So I asked her to  _  the cab and I'd give her a ride. To my  _  , she said okay without  _  . I wonder if I'd have been so  _  if a stranger made me the same offer!\nWhere she was going was  _  on the way to where I was going. It was such a  _  interaction. But there was more!\nWhen I had  picked up  what I went for and was waiting at the checkout, the woman behind me said she had a coupon for 50% off any  _  in the store. She gave it to me because she had a(n)  _  one! I thanked her and gave her a  _  card.\nThey say \"what goes around comes around\", but sometimes it is hard to see how that  _  as there is often a \"manifestation delay\". Each action  _  a ripple  that eventually  _  back to us, but sometimes it is much  _  so we forget their connection.\nToday the causes and effects have appeared in a linkable manner in  _  . I'm also opening myself to receiving gifts, now or in the future. I can learn so much from others as to how  _  they are to receive gifts in a way I might not have been if  _  the same.",
