    "article": "There are two types of people in the world. Although they have equal degrees of health and wealth and the other comforts of life, one becomes happy,  the other  becomes unhappy. This  _  from the different ways in which they consider things, persons, and events, and the resulting effects upon their minds. The people who are to be happy  _  their attention to the conveniences of things, the pleasant parts of conversation, the well-prepared dishes, the goodness of the wines, and the fine weather. They enjoy all the cheerful things. Those who are to be unhappy think and speak only of the  _  things. They are,  _  , continually unsatisfied. By their words, they complain about the pleasure of society, offend many people, and  _  themselves disagreeable everywhere. If this turn of mind were founded in nature, such unhappy persons would be more to be pitied. The intention of criticizing and being disliked is perhaps taken up  _  by imitation . It grows into a habit, unknown  _  its possessors. The habit may be strong, but it may be cured when those who have it are  convinced of  its bad effects on their interests and tastes. I hope this little warning may be of service to them, and  _  them change this habit. Although in fact it is chiefly an act of imagination, it has serious  _  in life, since it causes deep sorrow and bad luck. Those people offend many others, nobody loves them, and no one treats them with more than the most  _  politeness and respect. This  _  puts them in bad temper and draws them into arguments. If they aim at obtaining  _  advantages in social position or fortune, nobody wishes them success. Nor will anyone start a step  _  speak a word to favor their hopes. If they cause themselves public objections , no one will  _  or excuse them, and many  _  join to criticize their wrongdoings. These people should change this bad habit and be pleased with what is pleasing,  without  worrying needlessly about themselves and others. If they do not,  _  will be good for others to avoid any contact with them. Otherwise, it can be disagreeable and sometimes very inconvenient,  _  when one becomes mixed up in their quarrels.",
