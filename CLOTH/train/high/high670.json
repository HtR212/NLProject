If you can  _  the tail of any one of the three bulls, you can marry my daughter.\"  _  , the young man got out and stood in the field,  waiting for  the first bull. The barn door  _  and out came the biggest bull that he had ever seen. He  _  that one of the next bulls had to be a better  _  than this one, so he ran over to the side and let the bull  pass through  . A few  _  later, the barn door opened again. Unbelievable! The young man had never seen any bull so  _  and fierce as this one in his life. It stood there, pawing the  _  and eyeing the young man. \" What the next  _  was like ? It had to be a better choice than this one,\" he thought. He let the bull pass through again. The door opened a third time. A  _  came across the young man's face. This was the weakest bull that he had ever seen. \" This one was my bull,\" he  _  to himself. As the bull came running by, he positioned himself just right and  _  at just the exact moment. He threw his hands to catch ...... But to his  _  , the bull had no tail. Life is full of opportunities.  _  catch the first one.",
