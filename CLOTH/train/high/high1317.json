Eliza began to see Betty as the source of all her problems, and she  _  to remember that she had not particularly wanted the promotion anyway. Now she just thought that it should be hers. Instead of  _  herself to see what her real goal was in the life, she tried to  figure out  how to trap Betty and regarded Betty as her enemy. Eliza became  _  focused on her resentment, and she couldn't get out of the  _  situation.\nOne of the major problems with resentment is that you  _  that your anger is completely caused by others.
