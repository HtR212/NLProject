    "article": "Earlier this morning I e-mailed an old friend, Mark. We have been out of touch for 12 years, but the  _  is a wonderful thing. Finding his e-mail address  _  less than a minute. He is working on his doctoral paper in western America. Mark and I met at a summer  _  that we both attended. I went every year from the time I was 8 or 9 until I was 15. I don't  _  exactly, but I think Mark was there for as many years as I was. We lived close to each other and  _  saw each other around the campsite, but not often. Mostly we stayed together for a week or two in the  _  and wrote letters back and forth during the rest of the first few years. I still have all of his letters in a box somewhere. I come across them occasionally and  _  to sit down and read through them, but I never have. He was a  _  and precious friend to me, and I am deeply  _  that we have drifted so far apart. Mark was a very kind and incredibly bright and funny  _  . He loved Monty Python -- I mean he was a fanatic , and could  _  entire movies from memory. He was one of those kids who  _  such a unique and powerful mind  _  they never quite fit into the main stream of life.  _  Mark, who I believe realized that, never seemed to care about it. When I knew that Mark was working on his  _  (on a highly intellectual and fairly mysterious and difficult topic), I thought, \"Well yes, of course.\" He is just where I would  _  him to be. I wonder if he will write me back. I wonder if he will be  _  by where I am. I wonder whether he and I can be  _  again, or whether these years have left us with  nothing  in common. I wonder whether he can ever be the man I  _  , or only remain the boy I knew.",
