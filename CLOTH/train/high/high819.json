    "article": "Recently I was on a team traveling in a foreign country with some friends and some strangers. We were all given   _   to perform, such as cleaning and cooking. I was in the team serving   _  .\n               On the first day I tried hard to   _   everyone, but it was hard to do so. Some people liked it when you served them fast and some people   _   it slow, some even didn't know what I was   _   on their plates as they didn't speak English. If they weren't served in the way they wanted, some grew   _  . \n               So the next day, I tried a different way. I learnt how to say \"Would you like ...\" in several   _   and tried to make sure that they understood me. So when people   came up   to me, I smiled at them and said \"Would you like some   _  ?\" Whether they said yes or no, I just   _   back.\nI even said something   _   to them, like their beautiful hats or cool sunglasses. To be honest, I wasn't sure if I was making them smile, or just   _   them! I was so enthusiastic that we actually ran out of beans before everyone got served! \nThen we   _   to do other things for people that weren't our duty too, like cleaning up, or washing dishes when everyone was   _   to do their own. \nAt first people were   _   when we did this, then they realized that they were getting a   _   without giving anything in return and they would be   _  . After a few days, whenever I saw people I had served they smiled and thanked me, saying how it had   brightened up   their day and that we hadn't just put food on their plates. \n    We were even   awarded as   the best servers at the end! So sometimes a smile or a   _   5 attitude makes all the difference!",
