    "article": "One day in autumn my father gathered us three into the living-room with a look on his face that told us that one of us had done something wrong.\n\"Which one of you did this?\" he asked with a sharp41 _ .\nWe all  _  down at the floor showing the art of a child's handwriting  _  chalk. I stood there, trembling  _  and hoping that no one else could see it. \"Will he know it was me?\" I secretly  _  . Scared, the only words that came from my mouth were, \"Not me, father.\"\nThe others denied it as well. Of course, we knew that one of us must have done it. But I, being the  _  of the three, just couldn't find the  _  to tell the truth. I was not a bad kid. Lying was not normal for me,  _  the expression on my father's face made me  _  .\n\"Since   _  of you seemed to have done it, then you will all get a spanking .\"\nWhat? The  _  thing I wanted was a spanking!\n\"I did it,\" someone said and I looked around to see one of my elder sisters step  _  . Why did she  _   it? Feeling guilty, yet still too  _  to say a word, I  _  there knowing my sister was going to get   _  for something I did.\nWe didn't talk about that day for years. When we were all older, I knew it was safe to finally tell my father it was really me. When I think back to that  _  , I know I learned the  _  of family, and of a sister who would do  _  for me. I'm glad to say that I know now I would do the same for  _  .",
