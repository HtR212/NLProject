    "article": "I used to believe in the American dream, which meant a job, a mortgage, credit cards, success. I wanted it and worked toward it like everyone else, all of us   _   chasing the same thing.\nOne year, through a series of unhappy events, it all fell   _  . I found myself homeless and alone. I had my truck and $56. I   _   the countryside for some place I could rent for the   _   possible amount. I came upon a shabby house four miles up a winding mountain road   _   the Potomac River in West Virginia. It was   _  , full of broken glass and rubbish. I found the owner, rented it, and   _   a corner to camp in. \nThe locals knew nothing about me,   _   slowly, they started teaching me the   _   of being a neighbor. They dropped off blankets, candles, and tools, and began   _   around to chat. They started to teach me a belief in a   _   American Dream----not the one of individual achievement but of   _  .\nWhat I have believed in, all those things I thought were   _   for a civilized life, were nonexistent in this place.   _   on the mountain, my most valuable possessions were my   _   with my neighbors.\nFour years later, I moved back into   _  . I saw many people were having a really hard time,   _   their jobs and homes. I managed to rent a big enough house to   take in   a handful of people. There were four of us then in the house, but over time I got nine people come in and moved on to other places. We'd all be in   _   if we hadn't banded together.\nThe American Dream I believe in now is a shared one. It's not so much about what I can get for myself. It's about   _   we can all get by together.",
