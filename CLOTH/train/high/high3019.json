He didn't really want to tell his mom what was   bothering   him. \" S-something happened at the p-park , \"  he  stammered ( )      _    .  \" l...I  lied  to Aaron , and now he won ' t   talk to    me. He knows I lied. \"\n      \"  why   did you do that?\" Mom asked gently.\n     \"I...I don ' t know , \"  murmured Christopher. \"I  told him I was   _    .but I don ' t think he will forgive me. \"\n     \"Are you really sorry?\" asked Mom.\n     Christopher nodded. \"I don ' t think he'll ever believe me again,   said Christopher      _    .\n     Mom     _    for a minute. \" Honey , do you remember the      _     Dad and I used to give you?\"  she asked. \"The ones you called horsey rides?\"  Christopher nodded,   wondering      why Mom brought that up. \"You thought it was so much fun until you fell     _     the  ' horse '  one day and hit your head on a chair,\" said Mom. \"After that it took you a long time to trust    _   enough to try it again. \"\n       \"   _     I finally did! \"  Christopher said eagerly. He thought he knew what his mother was getting at  .\n       \"Yes ,and I' m     _     Aaron  will  trust  you  again, too. \"  said  Mom.  \" When  you  lie  to someone ,it takes   _     for that person to really believe you again. \"  Mom smiled. \" There will also be bad     _  of what you ' ve done-like a friend who won ' t speak to you for a while- and Aaron needs time t0   get over   what happened.   _    ,be a good friend and help him trust you , again. Can you do that?\"\n     Christopher nodded and promised , \"I'll be  a     _      friend l \"",
