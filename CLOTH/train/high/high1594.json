    "article": "Almost everyone wants to get smarter. We struggle to improve our  _  , intelligence and attention. We drink cup after cup of coffee to help us  get through  the day.  _  , a new study published in Current Directions in Psychological Science warns that there are  _  to how smart humans can get. Each of our body parts develops in a certain way for a reason.  For example  , we are not 3 meters tall  because  most people's hearts are not strong enough to send  _  up that high. Scientists say that our thinking ability works in the same way. A baby's brain size is limited by a series of  _  , such as the size of the mother's pelvis . If our brains developed to be bigger, there could be more  _  during childbirth. The study of Jews, who have an average IQ much  _  than other Europeans, showed they were more  _  to develop diseases of the  _  system. This might be because of their increased brainpower. If intelligence cannot be improved, can we at least get better at  _  ? Not really, say scientists. They studied  _  like caffeine that improve attention. They found the drugs only helped people with serious  _  problems. For those who did not have trouble paying attention, the drugs could have the  _  effect. Scientists say that this suggests there is a(n)  _  limit to how much people can or should concentrate. Our memory is also a \"double-edged sword\". People with extremely good memories could  end up  having a difficult life because they cannot  _  bad things that happen to them. Thomas Hills, one of the authors of the paper, said that  _  all the problems in trying to get smarter, it's unlikely that there will ever be a \"super mind\".",
