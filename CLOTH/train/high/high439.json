At the party, all the children were given  _  in bright, beautiful colors. After a short time, as I  looked around  , I saw blue clouds, orange sunrises and purple flowers. The pictures were all bright. The boy sitting next to me was painting a heart, but it was dark and lifeless. It didn't have bright colors that his fellow  _  had used. I thought maybe he took the only paint that was left and it just happened to be dark. But when I asked him about it, he said his  _  was that color. I asked him why and he told me that he was sick. He looked  _  into my eyes and said, \"There is nothing anyone can do that will help.\" I certainly understood why he was sad. I said, \"It isn't  _  that there is nothing anyone can do to help. Other people may not be able to make you  _  better but we can do things, like giving bear hugs, which will help when you are feeling sad.\" I also told him that I'd be happy to give him one so that he could see what I meant. He immediately gave me a huge hug and I thought my own heart would be  _  with love for this sweet boy. As the day was coming to an end, I was getting ready to  _  home. I turned around and found that standing there with a smile on his face was the little boy. He said, \"My heart is  _  colors. It is getting brighter. Those hugs really do  _  .\" On my way home I felt my own heart had changed to a brighter color, too.",
