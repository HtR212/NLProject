It certainly wasn't  _  doing this with a white shirt and suit on. Nightfall was approaching. Suddenly a car pulled  _  from behind me. A man got out and offered to  _  me. Seeing his unpleasant appearance and tattoos on his arm, I became  _  as thoughts of robberies flashed through my mind. But  _  I could say anything he had already begun to take the tools to change the  _  . While watching him I happened to look back at his car and noticed someone sitting in the passenger seat. This had  _  me. Then, without  _  , it began to rain. He suggested that I wait in his car because my car was unsafe. As the rain increased, getting us wet within seconds, I  _  agreed. When I settle into the back seat, a woman's voice came from the front seat. \"Are you all right?\" She turned around to me. \"Yes, I am.'' I replied with much  _  when seeing an old woman there.

I tried to offer him money and of course he  _  it. It was shameful that I judged people by the way they  _  . As we shook hands I began to apologize for my  _  . He said, ''I experience that same  _  often. People who look like me don't do nice things. I  _  thought about changing the way. But then I saw this as a chance to make a  _  . So I'll leave you with the same question I ask everyone who takes time to know me. If Jesus returned tomorrow and walked among us again, would you recognize Him by what He wore or by what He did?''",
