The other, who was less attractive, with   _   background and worse records, entered a TAFE (Technical and Further Education) and became a receptionist at a five-star hotel.\nWith no   _  , the first girl got a job in a big company, got to know someone who was well-educated,   _  and wealthy. They went on a marriage after a two-year's love relationship.   Everyone   thought it was a marriage that was made by the Heaven.\nThe other girl got to know a visiting professor from USA   by chance   at work. People had no idea how they would finally get   _   with a large age gap and poorer communications in English, but anyway, both of them seemed to be   _   about each other.\nLater on, the first girl gave birth to a baby girl. The   _   had been OK for a few years; however, with the growth of her husband's   _  , the man started having some affairs with other women, which came to light one day and were   _   by a divorce. What's worse, she had no 33 _  in re-gaining her happiness. Presently she is still alone and lonely.\nHow about the other one? Later on, she went to the States,   _   two children. She went to university while looking after her children. Once the children   _   their school age, she had already gained graduate   _   for accounting and went to work more professionally. She had a   _  life (not only in everyday life but also mentally). She now has a good career,   _   life and social circle. Life seems to have been kind to her.
