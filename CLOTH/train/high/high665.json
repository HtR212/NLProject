    "article": "The day before Mother's Day, Mrs. Berry asked her students to make a card for their mothers. She passed out paper and pieces of cloth. Mary looked for a while at the blue cloth and began to cut it. Then she  _  her paper in half and began writing. When Mary finally looked at the message the teacher gave on the paper, she noticed something else. She felt her  _  grow hot---she hadn't heard that anyone who didn't have a mother could make one for a grandmother or an aunt. As her teacher  _  to her, Mary tried covering her card with her arm, but Mrs. Berry gently lifted it so that she could  _  it. Mary sat  _  , waiting for her to say something, but she saw a  _  roll down Mrs. Berry's face. She had never made Mrs. Berry so  _  . When school was over, Mary  _  until all the other kids left so that she could apologize . \"I'm sorry for not listening. I'll make another card  _  you want. I'll do it at home and  _  it tomorrow.\" \"  _  are you talking about?\" asked Mrs. Berry. \"My Mother's Day card. I know you're sad because I didn't do it  _  .\" \"Mary, that was the  _  card in the whole class. It was so  _  that it made me cry. \" Mary was so  _  that she ran out of the classroom. When her father came home from work that night, Mary  _  to give him the card early . On the front of the card was a  _  of Mary's father, with a blue piece of cloth cut like his hair. Inside the card she had written: Dear Dad, I know you work really hard to be both a  _  and a father. I want to thank you and  _  you a Happy Mother's Day! Love Mary When her dad read the card he started  _  , just like Mrs Berry did.",
