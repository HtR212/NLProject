I wasn't in a hurry, so I    _   waited for the boy to realize that I was there. It was obvious now, he was mentally   _   and a little shocked as he turned and saw me standing so   _   to him, waiting to   squeeze by  . I said, \"Hey Buddy, what's your name?\"\n \"My name is Denny and I'm   _   with my Mommy,\" he responded proudly.\n\"Wow,\" I said, \"that's a(n)   _   name; I wish my name was Denny, but my name is Steve. How old are you Denny?\"\n \"How old am I now, Mommy?\" he asked his mother as she slowly   came over   from the next aisle. \"You're fifteen years old, Denny\". Then he headed toward the toy section.\nDenny's mom   thanked   me for taking the time to talk with her son. She told me that most people wouldn't   _   look at him, much less talk to him.\nI told her that it was my   _   and that there are plenty of red, yellow, and pink roses in God's Garden;   _  , \"Blue Roses\" are very   _   and should be appreciated   _   their beauty and distinctiveness. \nYou see, Denny is a Blue Rose and   _   someone doesn't stop and   _   that rose with their heart and touch that rose with their kindness, then they've 59 _  a blessing from God. So, the next time you see a BLUE ROSE, don't turn your head and walk off.   Take the time   to smile and say Hello.",
