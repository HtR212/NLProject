I felt like I was at the  _  point.\n    One day, I made a trip across town to the store. After I  _  , I realized I had left\nmy purse with credit cards at home.  _  , I had a small\namount of cash in my pocket, so I  _  it, my coupons   and went inside. The store was really  _  , but I just found what I\nneeded, waiting for the cashier   to check out my  _  . I waited and waited, meanwhile my anger grew. I had a bad day\nand all I wanted to do was go home, but I was  _    in the line.\nFinally, I got to the front, but the cashier didn't  _  my coupons.  I\nwas upset because I had used  _  coupons there before. \nIt didn't  _  me.  I would just pay in cash.  Then\nthe Cashier said it was 10 dollars. SHOCK! I was a little  _  .\nNow I was mad at myself for forgetting my purse and only taking a small amount\nof cash. Without a credit card or anything else, I  _  my things\nand started to go back out to my car, wondering to myself why everything had  _  for me.\n     Just as I was headed out, an employee   _  me and said a lady in the  _  had paid the difference for me and left.  _  the\namount she paid was small, the act was huge.  A stranger, whom I had never\nmet, completely changed my attitude with her  _  . Maybe next\ntime I see someone having a  _  day, I'll do the same as her.\nAfter all, you never know whose day you might change.",
