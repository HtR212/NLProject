    "article": "Someone recently asked me when I became more confident about my abilities as an entrepreneur. I thought it was a funny question,   _   I' not very confident at all, and constantly filled with   _   about every decision I make.\nIt doesn't exactly hold me back in my work; it's just that I am very   _   of what I do, and I'm always   _   on the way I work, think and talk. I have also learned over the years that making a decision is often more important than making the   _   decision. Preferably your decisions are the right ones, but inaction or indecisiveness is more   _   than making the wrong decisions every now and then.\nThere is one thing I have learned over the years that I wish I had learned earlier in my career. And that is the   _   that I am not stupid.\nIt sounds logical, but I often sat in on meetings and heard people explain things and then   _   to myself, \" I don't understand that. Maybe I'm stupid?\" or I would hear about a startup and I wouldn't   _   their business model and think I'm stupid. Or I would hear an entrepreneur speak and think, \" That all like   _   bullshit, but I must be stupid, because other people seem to love it.\"\nA couple of years ago, I came to the   _   that I was not stupid at all. When people in meetings say things I don't' understand I   _   up and tell them so. Usually, I hear a sigh of   _   in the room and find out nobody understood what was being talked about.\nWhen I don't understand a business model it usually means there is not one, or it   _  . Turns out I'm not stupid and   _   I don't understand it, most people won't understand it at all.   Apart from   doubting my own abilities I've learned to   _   my \"bullshit radar\" a bit more and not understanding something is a clear sign that something is   _  .\nMy advice to young entrepreneurs is this: you are not stupid! If something does not make   _  , if it sounds stupid, if you don't understand it, something is wrong! Trust your gut( )   _  .  Feel free not to know and be honest when you don't' understand something!",
