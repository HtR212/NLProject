    "article": "When 24-year-old Hannah Brencher moved to New York after college,she was hit by loneliness. One day she felt so   _   that she want to reach out to someone. And so she put pen to paper and started writing letters-letters to complete   _    .\nBut these weren't   _   letters about how she was feeling. There were happy letters,all about the other person,not her. She would write messages for people to have a \"  _   day \" and tell strangers how brilliant they were,5 even if  they thought no one else had noticed. Brencher began dropping the   _   all over New York,in cafes,in library books,in parks and on the subway. It made her   _   letter,knowing that she might be making somebody's   _   through just a few   _   words. It gave her   _   to focus on. And so,The Word Needs More Love Letters was born.\nThe movement is all about   _   letters--not emails,but handwritten letters. Not   _   love letters,written to a real beloved,but   _   letters for strangers. They don't necessarily say \"I love you\",but they are   full of   kindness--telling people they are remarkable and   _   and all-round amazing. It's the sort of stuff that most people don't really say out loud even to the people they   care about  ,let alone a total stranger.\nBrencher's initiative  has now   _  .There are more than 10,000 people who join in all over the world. Last year,she gave a talk. In it,she talked about a university student who dropped letters around her campus,only to suddenly   _   everyone was writing them and there were love letters hanging from the trees.\nIt's a very cute idea. I know that if I was on the   _   end of a letter like that,it almost certainly would put a   _   on my face. So I decided to give it a try and see if I could do the same for someone else.",
