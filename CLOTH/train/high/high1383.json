    "article": "As I had my first child, I promised myself never to be a pushy parent. I was going to be a very  _  and understanding mother.\nFive years later my little boy was about to  _  for his yellow belt in karate . As a five-year-old child, he wasn't taking it  seriously  , because it was Mom trying to help him. I found myself yelling and telling him he would never get the belt acting like that. I was trying to  _  him his back-flip . He continued to play and I continued to  _  . Finally I had made him feel like he couldn't  _  anything, just as I promised myself I wouldn't do.\nStill mad and stubborn I couldn't  give in  . I had to teach him his flip. He was doing fine with it by the time we had to leave to go to karate. While taking the test, he did  _  . His instructor would ask him to do something, and it became  _  for him. He never asked him to do the back-flip. He had passed his yellow belt test.\nWe got in the car to  go home  when he looked at me and said \"Mom, why did you make me do that back-flip so many times,  _  it wasn't even on the test.\" The words wouldn't have  _  anything to anyone else, but it was a slap in my face. That night while  lying  \nHe was  _  and didn't say anything, just giggled. I said \"I really do love you baby.\" I was still feeling  _  , and also wondering if he had  _  me. Finally he replied in the  _  voice, \"I know you do, but I love you more.\"\nHe had forgiven me and I had decided that his feeling were more  _  than any test he would  _  take. I made a new  _  to be better mother and to accept that he was only a child.",
