The key to effective advertising today is to focus on the    _  .\nSome are the    _   ways every advertiser could work out. You can print a specific offer of your goods or service on door-hangers and place them on doorknobs in your area. Door-hangers on doorknobs will produce results in direct    _   about the strength of your offer. If you need to reach the drivers, flyer   under windshield   wipers may have better effect than door-hangers. Imagine, how    _   if you hire someone to be a walking ad or launch a T-shirt advertising,    that is  , you can print your products on T-shirts of your    _  .

You simply can't   _   the power of your name on the cover of a book. You might only sell a few copies online, but the copies you give away in your town will make you a fortune. You won't make money on the book. You'll make it because of the book.\nOf course, word-of-mouth is the best way to promote your   _  . Friends and past customers recommend your products to their family, friends and colleagues. Word-of-mouth works because the   _    is based on previous positive experiences.",
