But unfortunately, her son died of disease without   _   medicine or nutrition in those days of hardships. She was very sorrowful but said to her   _  , \"We have a tough destiny, but however tough our lives will be, we should also   _  . Though we have lost our son, we can have   another  . There are no such setbacks that we could not overcome.\"\nAfter the second son was born, her husband died of edema , which almost   _   her away. But eventually, she recovered and was determined to   _   up her children alone. Her efforts made the family life better and better. As her two daughters and son got married one after another, she was   _   gradually and could not do the farm work any more.  _   she stayed at home and did some housework.\nNevertheless, the Heaven seemed to show no affection to her who had undergone a   _   life. She got her leg broken   _   when she was nursing her grandson.  Due to   her old age that posed a great risk to her operation, she could not   _   operation and had to lie in bed all day long. Her children all cried heavily, while she merely said, \"Why do you cry? I am still living.\"  Even though   she could not rise from bed, she did not complain about anything and anybody.  _  , she sat on the bed and did some stitching work . She lived strongly until 86. Before she died, she asked her children to remember, \"There are no such setbacks that we could not overcome!\"[\nOur tolerating ability is indeed way   _   our imagination. But not until the very critical moment will we realize our   _   tolerating ability. We will only get to realize our own iron will and strong tolerating ability after getting   _   heavily. Therefore, no matter what you are   _   from now, do not merely complain about the   _   of our destiny and maintain low-spirited all the time. Only those who have no   _   and courage to overcome setbacks will be defeated at last!",
