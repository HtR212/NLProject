I   _   her, threw her a hateful look and ran out. One of my classmates said, \"EEEE, your mom only has one eye!\"\nI wanted to   _   myself. I also wanted my mom to just disappear. I confronted   her that day and said, \"39 _  you're only going to make me a laughing stock, why don't you just die?\"\nMy mom did not respond... I didn't   _   stop to think for a second about what I had said, because I was full of anger.\nI wanted to escape from that house, and had   _   to do with her. So I studied extra hard, got a chance to go abroad to study. \nThen, I got married, and I had a happy family with three kids. One day, my mother came to visit me. When she stood by the door, my children   _   her, and I yelled at her for coming 43 _ uninvited. \"How dare you come to my house and   _   my children! GET OUT OF HERE!\"\nAnd to this, my mother 45 _  answered, \"Oh, I'm so sorry. I may have got the wrong address,\" and she disappeared. \nOne day, a letter regarding a school 46 _  came to my house. So I   _   to my wife that I was going on a business trip. After that, I went to my old shack   just out of   _  . My neighbors said that she died. I did not shed (drop) a single   _  . One of them handed me a letter.\n\"My dearest son,\nI miss you all the time. I'm sorry that I went to your house and scared your children.\nI was so glad when I heard you were coming for the reunion. But I may have lost the   _   to get out of bed to see you. I'm sorry that I was a   _   embarrassment to you when you were growing up.\nWhen you were very little, you got into an accident, and lost your eye. As a mother, I couldn't 52 _  watching you having to grow up with one eye. So I gave you mine. I was so proud of my son who was 53 _  a whole new world for me, in my place.\nWith all my love to you,\nYour mother.\"\nUnder no circumstances should we neglect our parents who have   _   everything for us--it is a matter of   _  . Be good to them and repay them.",
