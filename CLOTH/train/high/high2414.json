I just can't  _  me if I can't understand some easy things. Currently, I just feel  _  with myself because I couldn't finish the assignment on the lab, and what was  _  worse was that actually I did not understand what the  _  was! Fiona asked me why I didn't  _  for help. The problem is that if I have to ask some silly questions, I will feel  _  . Before I came here I was confident. But I have totally lost it. Sometimes I can't  _  find the right words; sometimes I am too shy to  _  others. I have to admit that I am  _  . The wisest people are always  those  who can take advantage of others' wisdom. But I was so stupid as to close myself and  _  a lot of time soaking inside the workbook,  _  made me more confused. Why can't I follow the sentence?
