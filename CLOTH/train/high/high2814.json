He thought it was a long trip to where God lived,   _   he packed his suitcase with lots of food and drinks and he started his  _  .\n              When he had gone about three blocks, he   came across  an elderly man. The boy sat down next to him and  _  his suitcase. He was about to take a drink when he noticed that the man looked  _  , so he offered him a drink.\n              The man   _  it and smiled at the boy. His smile was so pleasant that the boy wanted to see it again, so he   _  him another one.\n              The man   _  smiled at him. They sat there all afternoon eating and smiling, but they never said a word.\n              As it grew dark, the boy   _  it was time to leave, but before he had gone more than a few steps, he   turned around  , ran back to the man, and gave him a hug. The man  _  him his biggest smile ever.\n              When the boy   _  home a short time later, his mother was surprised by the look of   _   on his face. She asked him what made him so happy.\n              He replied, \"I had lunch with God, and God's got the most beautiful   _  I've ever seen!\"\n              Meanwhile, the elderly man returned to his home. His son was  _  by the look of joy on his face and asked him the   _  question as the little boy's mother. The elderly man replied, \"I ate and drank in the park with God.\" However, he   _  , before his son responded, \"You know, he's much   _  than I expected.\"\n              Too often we underestimate the   _  of a touch, a smile, a kind word, all of which have the potential to turn a life around. We should treat the people we meet  _  ; they come into our lives for a reason. Embrace all equally!",
