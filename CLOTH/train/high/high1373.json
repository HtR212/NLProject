    "article": "There was a time when, if a lady got onto a crowded bus or train, a gentleman would immediately stand up and   _   her his seat. No more, though. Today a gentleman will probably look out of the window,   _  , if he feels a bit guilty, hide behind his newspaper.   _   way, the lady will have to stand   _   someone else gets off.\nYou can't entirely   _   men for this change in manners, though. The days are gone   _   women could be   _   to as the weaker sex without causing offence. A whole generation of women has grown up   demanding   equality with men; not just equality in jobs or education,   _   in social attitudes. Hold a door open for some women and you're   _   to get an angry lecture on treating women as inferiors,   unable   to open doors for themselves.   Take   a girl out for a meal and she'll probably   insist on   paying her share of the bill; though on second thoughts perhaps that's not such a bad   _  . \nIt's no   _  , then, that men have given up some of the automatic gestures of politeness and consideration   _   they used to show towards women. On the other  _  , automatic male politeness is perhaps slowly being   replaced   by true consideration for the needs and feelings of women,   so that   men can see women as equal human beings, rather than   as   sex-objects or attractive properties.",
