    "article": "Last spring, Michelle fell in love with kite-boarding, an adventure sport that combines surfing and sailing. So she got a kite-board, took some   _   and a few months later drove out to the Banana River. There she met John, who offered to help her   _   her skills.\nOne day, John   _   Michelle while his wife, Nancy, stayed behind on a Jet Ski  . In that way, there would be   _   to bring back Michelle if she got into trouble. After John gave her a few   _   , he took off. He'd sailed about three quarters of a mile down the river when he felt the wind   pick up   . He knew that the stronger the wind grew, the more   _   it would be for Michelle to control her board.   _  , he turned and started sailing back toward the two women. \nMichelle had   _   decided to head for shore. The wind was too strong for her to handle the kite. She prepared to land her   _   by releasing one of the four lines that kept the sail in the air.   _   she didn't have a chance. She was thrown over the water, still   _   to the kite. Seconds later, a huge wind sent the kite upward. Even more dangerous, the sail's lines started to twist together, round and round. Michelle   _   to free from the kite. But she failed. \nNancy was several hundred feet away on the Jet Ski and couldn't get to her   _   enough to help. By then, John had closed in and Michelle felt John   _   her out of the water. As she held his arm, he tried to pull the handle but couldn't   _   it. Then suddenly, John let go. At that point, Michelle was sure she would die without him holding   _   her. But John had seen Nancy approaching and   _   that he'd have a better chance of helping Michelle. He jumped onto the Jet Ski. As the kite dived down, with all his   _   , he jumped from the Jet Ski onto the kite and dragged it to the water. Finally Michelle was saved.\nThis experience hasn't kept Michelle from loving kite-boarding. \"Life is fragile  , but it's meant to be   _   ,\" she says.",
