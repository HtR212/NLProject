    "article": "-I was six when I joined my father and two elder brothers at sunrise in the fields of Eufaula, Okla.  _  the time I was eight I was helping Dad fix up old furniture. He gave me a cent for every nail I  _  out of old boards. I got my first  _  job, at JM's Restaurant in town, when I was 12. My main responsibilities were  _  tables and washing dishes,  _  sometimes I helped cook. Every day after school I would  _  to JM's and work until ten. Even on Saturdays I  _  from two until eleven. At that age it was difficult going to work and  _  my friends run off to swim or play. I didn't necessarily like work, but I loved what working  _  me to have. Because of my  _  I was always the one buying when my friends and I went to the local Tastee Freez. This made me  _  . Word that I was trustworthy and hard-working  _  around town. A local clothing store offered me credit  _  I was only in seventh grade. I immediately  _  a $68 sports coat and a $22 pair of shoes. I was  _  only 65 cents an hour, and I already owed the storekeeper $90! So I learned  _  the danger of easy credit. I paid it  _  as soon as I could. My first job taught me self-control, responsibility and brought me a  _  of personal satisfaction few of my friends had experienced. As my father,  _  worked three jobs, once told me, \"If you  _  sacrifice and responsibility, there are not many things in life you can't have.\" How right he was.",
