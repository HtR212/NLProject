    "article": "Adventure is in my blood. And I had been considering how I was going to celebrate my high school graduation. I didn't just want a small  _  in the backyard. I started thinking about doing a solo  _  somewhere out of the ordinary. I took out  _  and drew the 1,500-mile route along which I would be  _  from the northernmost point in Norway to the southernmost section of Sweden. When I  _  my plans with my dad, he  _  as I thought he would. Because I get my adventurous  _  from him, he was all for it. I had only been away from my  _  three days now, but there was an inner  _  going on inside of me. Part of me was homesick and doubting whether I  _  could make it. The other part of me was ready to  _  to myself and my family that I could do it by myself. On the road, I met another  _  who was quite a bit older than I was. He had started his journey  _  by bike at the southern part of Norway and had just finished. I could tell he had a great sense of  _  . It encouraged me not to  give up  . As I listened to my  _  artists on my MP4 player, I pedaled with my feet. There was  _  around me for miles.  _  , that wasn't entirely true. There were mosquitoes--- millions of them. My arms were so dotted with  _  that they looked like a topographical map . But, however  _  it would be, nothing could stop my advance towards the destination. As you know, adventure is in my blood.",
