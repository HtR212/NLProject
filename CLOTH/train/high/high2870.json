    "article": "The rain was coming down heavily and I was going to be late for an important conference. Dressing up quickly, I called for a taxi,  _  that it would be faster than the subway. It wasn't. After a long wait, I finally got one, but the traffic was heavy. I looked at my  _  from time to time. Just as the traffic started moving, the driver  _  a man up ahead in a wheelchair. \"Wouldn't he be cold sitting right there!\" the driver cried and began to  pull over  . I could see there would be another 20 minutes'  _  --  _  him into the cab, folding up his chair and putting it into the taxi's small  _  , then dropping him off who knows where. \"What are you doing?\" I shouted to the driver. As the  _  came out, I wanted to take them back. The wrongness of my  _  to the driver shocked me. Why did I let out the shout? The driver  _  me and we continued the journey. Eventually I got out of the taxi and  _  to the office. As I ran, I understood that, though it wasn't my duty to take the time to help others, I shouldn't have  complained about  the driver's stopping. I should have been able to see beyond my impatience to notice what was most inerrant . Whenever I think of this incident, this is my  _  : I am not a  _  self-centered person, but I still feel  _  of being self-centered. Living a busy life in a fast-paced big city, do we still need to stop to help those who are in need of help?",
