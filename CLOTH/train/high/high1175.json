    "article": "As a teacher, my daily activity involves driving to a new school almost every day.\nOn one particular day, I was teaching in a very   _  classroom. I was managing behavior all morning, and by lunchtime I\nknew I needed a coffee to  _  the afternoon. So during my\nlunch break, I drove to a nearby square to get a coffee. Upon returning to the  _  , I realized I had locked my phone and my  _  inside!\nI had about 15 minutes to get back to the  _  , which was a\ngood five -minute drive. If I ran back really quickly, I could  _  it. But it was winter, and a sudden fall on the ice would only make\nthe situation much  worse  .\nSo I hurried into a McDonald's in the same square, and   _   the man at the counter, who happened to be the   _  , to call a taxi for me. After I  _  explained my\nsituation to him, he rushed inside to make the phone  _  I\nwaited anxiously in the restaurant. I had less than 10 minutes to  get back  to my school at this point.\nA moment later, the manager returned   _  to tell me that the line was  _  , and that he had\nnot been able to  _  the taxi yet. I think both  _  and fear could be seen in my face.\nWithout a thought, he grabbed his coat and   _  to drive me to the school. Without hesitation, I followed him into\nhis car and got back to the classroom with two minutes to  _  before\nthe bell rang!\nThis experience made me   _  that\nout of every seemingly hopeless situation, there is the opportunity for acts of\nkindness to happen, which has a(n)  _  influence on\nthose who receive them.",
