    "article": "About five years ago,I found myself working in a terrible middle school.  The hours were long and the work was boring.   _  , the pay was low.  Every day the job seemed a physical   _   for me. My neck would burn with pain from the   _   bending.  My feet would ache from   _   the entire day.  The skin around my fingernails would   _   because of the work my hands were doing.  I tried to keep my   _   up while I worked there, but day by day I felt myself   _   down.  Every morning I would press sticking-plaster on my neck, place Band-Aid around my fingers and   put on   my worn-out shoes.  And every night I would   _   myself home and fall onto the couch.\nOne evening I felt like I could  _   it no more.  As I drove home alone, I said to myself.  \"Why am I working myself here just to   _  ? Why couldn't I find a better job than this? Why do I have to   go through   this right now?\"\nI wasn't really expecting a(n)   _  , but life always loves to surprise us.  As I   _  up the steps to my front door, I found my wife and my son waiting for me   _   smiling faces.  \"Daddy, Daddy!\" my son yelled.  I smiled and picked him up with my   _   arms.  Then after hugging and kissing him, I laughed for the first time in days and sat down   _  .  At that time, I found the answer which would give me the   _   I needed to go on.\nEventually I moved on to a better school, but I  _   forgot that answer, which had gently reminded me of the simple truth.  We may have to work to live, but we live to   _  .  May you always fill your days with love and joy.",
