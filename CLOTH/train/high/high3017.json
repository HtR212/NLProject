    "article": "\"Efficiency is the by-product of comfort,\" says Dr. Erwin Tichauer of New York University. To prove this  _  , Dr. Tichauer uses his capability to find  _  ways to do things.  For example  , he felt that the traditional kind of pliers  _  a better design. The usual  _  limited hand movement and used unnecessary force because it bent the  _  . So he designed a pair of pliers to allow the wrist to remain in a comfortable position. To improve the design of  a tool  and then make work easier, Dr. Tichauer  _  the old tools. He asks such questions as: why  _  a stepladder have four legs  _  three are more stable? Why dose a screwdriver have to be made with straight handles? After testing his  _  , he has invented a new tool that causes less muscle injury and is more efficient. Tichauer is not interested in getting  _  from his inventions. In fact, he says, \"We  _  people to steal from us. At New York University, we do not patent knowledge or invention.\"  _  companies have adopted some of his inventions. As a biochemist, as well as inventor, Dr Techauer  _  the effect of stress on areas of the body. Even easy  _  work may put heavy stress on small areas of body and  in time  causes a serious disease. Thus his studies of workers in factories who use the  _  tool all day long are extremely  _  in learning about the damage on human body? Dr. Techauer knows that he can not redesign the  _  so he redesigns the tool!",
