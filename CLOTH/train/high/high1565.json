    "article": "It had been a long drive to the Veteran's hospital. My brother and I had gone to   _   my Dad who had been   _   days earlier, weak, sick and confused. The   _   had diagnosed him with pneumonia  and found cancer cells in his brain. My Dad looked so   _   lying there in bed. It wasn't just the   _   that was getting to him. It was also being so   far away from   his family and friends.  \nAs I sat by his   _   , a little woman with a big smile   _   into his room. She was at least 80 years old but seemed to have the   _   of someone 60 years younger. She was a volunteer   _   handmade get-well cards from the local elementary school. Gently, she took my Dad's hand and thanked him for his service to our country. It was the first time since he had gotten   _   that I saw my Dad smile. I   _   her into the hallway as she left and   _   her for lifting my Dad's   _   . \"I am just sharing a little   _   , sweetie,\" she said with a smile as she walked into the next   _   room to share a little more.\nThat 80-year-old angel reminded me again of what is   _   in this life: sharing our love. When we share our love, we create   _   not only in the hearts of those   _   us, but in our own hearts as well. When we share our love, we find ourselves doing what we were always   _   to do. When we share our love, we make our souls lighter, our lives brighter and the world better.",
