But she  _  expected that a third of the town would  roll up  their sleeves to bring her vision to life! \"A lot of learning comes through play,\" said Mardy, \"But my  _  students (with special needs) are too often left out because  _  playgrounds will stop wheelchairs dead in their tracks.\" The city committee  _  to mark out a piece of land for the playground. The Kiwanis Club came through with $7,000 and that's  _  the grassroots movement really got started. Soon small businesses were giving some money. The local Pieper Foundation  _  to donate half of the remaining $170,000 balance. Finally Mardy  _  a considerable sum of money that could  _  the construction materials. And what Mardy  _  was 500 volunteers work six 12-hour days. On the first day of the construction, a lot of people came. Two women heard about the  _  on the way to work and took the day  _  to help. A couple drove the tool truck. Families brought pieces of wood for the fence and bricks for walkways. \"It was truly a(n)  _  week, you know,\" said Mardy very proudly.  _  with construction experience became organizers. Those who could  _  power tools formed a separate group. One team served  _  donated from local churches, and another organized activities for children of volunteers. Today the playground is one of most  _  destination in the area. There's a rocking ship, a climbing wall, high and low rings, and monkey bars. All children play shoulder to shoulder on the same playground having  _  whether they are able-bodied or disabled. It's  _  what Mardy imagined. You'll love it.",
