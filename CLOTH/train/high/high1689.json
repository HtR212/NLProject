He would take 10 photos of  himself  before he washed and would go  out of  class secretly three times every hour. At 16, he dropped out of school  so that  he could throw himself into his addiction , and he ate  _  . He did not leave his house for six months, and when he failed to take the perfect picture, he tried to  _  himself by taking an overdose . His mother, Penny,  _  to save him, and forced him to ask for help after his addiction had become  out of control  .

He has not taken a picture of himself in seven months and has  _  that achieving perfection is  _  . He told the Sunday Mirror, \"I was constantly  in search of  the perfect selfie and when I realized I couldn't, I wanted to die. I  _  my friends, my education, my health and almost my life. The only thing I  _  about was having my phone with me so that I could satisfy the desire for a picture of myself at any time of the day.\" He expressed his  _  to the doctors and said their help kept him  _  and called on others to ask for help  _  they ended up in hospital.
