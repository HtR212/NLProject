It  _  his absence from class the day before.\nI had seen Micky himself writing the note at his desk. Most parental-excuse notes I received were penned by my  _  . The forged  excuse notes made a large pile, with writing that ranged from imaginative to crazy. The  _  of those notes didn't realize that honest excuse notes were usually  _  : \"Peter was late because the alarm clock didn't go off.\"\nThe students always said that it was hard putting 200 words together on any subject, but when they  _  excuse notes, they were brilliant.\nSo one day I gave the excuse notes to my classes, saying, \"They're  _  to be written by parents, but actually they are not. True, Micky ? \" The students looked at me  _  .\n\"Now, this will be the first class to study the  _  of the excuse notes --- the first class, ever, to practice writing them. You're so  _  to have a teacher like me who has taken your best writing and turned it into a  _  worthy of study. \"\nEveryone smiled as I went on, \"You used your  _  . So try more now. Today I'd like you to write 'An Excuse Note from Adam/Eve to God'.\"  _  went down. Pens raced  _  paper. For the first time ever I saw students so  _  in their writing that they had to be asked to go to lunch by their friends.\nThe next day everyone had excuse notes.  _  discussions followed. The headmaster entered the classroom and walked  up and down  , looking at papers, and then said, \"I'd like you to see me in my office.\" My heart  _  .\nWhen I stepped into his office, he came to  _  my hand and said, \"I just want to tell you that that lesson, that task, whatever the hell you were doing, was  _  . Those kids were writing on the college  _  . Thank you. \"",
