We thought that it would be funny if we brought the checks to the  _  and simply deposited  it for the woman without  _  anything. Although  _  the money was a good thing to do, I made the suggestion that we should  _  that she do something good in  _  . So after some discussion, we got to Stacey's bank, saying that \"Hey, listen, at some point during the day a  _  named Stacey is going to come here  _  about losing her checks and some  _  . Tell her that her checks were found and the person that found them wanted her to read this  _  .\"\n\"Stacey. Hello, I found your checks and  _  it to the bank. I don't know if you take the train in the morning or if you live here, but there is a  _  man that sits outside the train station every morning, and I am sure that if you would like to  _  along the good deed, he would love a coffee and bagel  tomorrow morning. Have a great day!\"\nI am  _  to say that the next morning when we got off the train, the homeless man was there and he had a big cup of  _  and a bagel.",
