I tell her that it doesn't cost any more for her to   _  with me and it is  _  for me to do this.\nLast week, she brought a(n)   _  and said happily, \"I have something for you and you must accept it.\" I said. \"If there is money in it, I don't want it.\" But she   _  it on a stand. Later, I opened it to find a \"thank you\" card with  $ 10  in it. That night, I stopped at her house to give a plate of  _  fried chicken that I had. I took an envelope and put the $10  _  it along with a \"  _  \"card. When leaving, I felt it  _  in her door.\nThe next day, she paid a(n)  _  to my home to return my  _  , she said, \"Look, I know you put that letter in my door this morning, didn't you?\" I had  _  forgotten about it, and I thought from the sincere  _  on my face, she believed me when I said that I hadn't put any letter in her door that morning. Actually, it was the night before,   _  I thought I wasn't lying. She went on to   _  the envelope and enclosed the \"smile\"  _  , and told me how she was blessed with so many good things lately. I told her that I was so   _  for her, and that I hope she  _  to be so blessed.",
