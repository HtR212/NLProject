    "article": "My friend Erica and I went out for lunch and on our way home we came across a paper bag near the subway station. When we  _  it up, we found there were a bunch of checks  belonging to  a woman named Stacey, and a wallet with her ID card in it. The checks  _  about $3,000!Besides, there were three$100 bills. Erica suddenly thought up a  _  idea that we would simply deposit the  _  for the woman without saying anything. I alsothought it an interesting and good idea, but I  _  that we ask her to do something good  in return  . So we decided to go to the  _  where Stacey had deposited her money after some  _  . When we reached the teller ,Erica said \"Hey, Madam, at some point during the day a woman named Stacey with a(n)  _  expression on her face is going to come here asking about her lost checks and some cash.  _  her that her checks were found and the person who found them wanted her to read this  _  .\" \"Stacey, I found your checks and  _  them to the bank,\" the note read, \"I don't know whether you take the subway in the morning  _  live nearby, but there is a  _  man that sits outside the  _  every morning. If you would like to pass along the good  _  ,he would love a coffee and some bread tomorrow morning. Have a great day!\" I am  _  to say that the next morning when we came out of the subway station, the homeless man was there with a big cup of coffee and some bread. He also  _  some the following mornings. I guess Stacey was really  _  about having those checks placed into her account.",
