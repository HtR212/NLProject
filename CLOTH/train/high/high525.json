    "article": "Mrs. Jones was very fond of singing. She had a good  _  , except that some of her high notes tended to sound like a gate, which someone had forgotten to  _  . Mrs. Jones was very conscious of this  _  , and took every  _  she could find to practice these high  _  . As she lived in a small house where she could not practice without  _  the rest of the family, she usually went for long walks along the country roads whenever she had time, and practiced her high notes there. Every time she heard a  _  or a person coming along the  _  , she stopped and  _  until she could no longer be heard before she started practicing again, because she was a  _  person, and because she was sensitive about those high notes. One afternoon, however, a fast, open car came up behind her so  _  and so fast that she did not hear it until it was only a few yards from her. She was singing some of her highest and most  _  notes at the time, and as the car passed her, she saw an anxious  _  suddenly come over its driver's face. He put his brakes on violently, and as soon as the car stopped, jumped out and began to  _  all his tires carefully. Mrs. Jones did not dare to tell him what the noise he had heard had really been, so he got back into his car and drove off as  _  as he had been when he stopped.",
