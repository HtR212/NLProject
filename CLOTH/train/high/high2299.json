    "article": "My husband Jack hated Christmas. He didn't hate the true meaning of  Christmas  , but the commercial aspects of it. Knowing he felt this  _  , I decided one year to  _  the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so on. I reached for something  _  just for Jack. The idea came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was  _  at the junior level at the school he attended and shortly before Christmas, there was a non-league match  _  a team sponsored by a church. These youngsters from the church, dressed in shoes so  _  that shoestrings seemed to be the only thing holding them together,  _  our son's team were in their beautiful new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was  _  to see that the other team was wrestling without a helmet designed to  _  a wrestler's head. They clearly could not  _  them. Well, our son's team ended up defeating them and took every weight class. But as the other team  _  up from the mat, they walked around with a sense of pride that couldn't admit  _  . Jack, seated beside me, shook his head  _  , \"I wish just one of them could have won,\" he said. \"They have a lot of potential, but  _  like this could take the heart right out of them.\" Jack loved  _  and he knew them, having coached little league football, baseball. That's when the  _  for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and  _  some wrestling helmets and shoes and sent them to the church. On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Jack what I had done and that this was his  _  from me. His smile was the  _  thing about Christmas that year.",
