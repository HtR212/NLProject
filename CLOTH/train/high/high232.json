It was a(n)  _  experience, because we had the chance to do special  _  , to live with the local people, and to see the sights in that beautiful city. The reasons we  _  there were to work and to improve our spoken  _  . We spent two weeks there, and each of us lived in different homes and had  _  work. I'll tell you what I did! I  _  in a well-known travel agency that  _  people from all around the world and organized  _  in the south of Germany, different kinds of events, visits to festivals, and  _  for tourists and businessmen. I  _  the first week working in a(n)  _  including one Japanese, two Australians and four Americans. The most  _  thing that we experienced was traveling through  _  on the Danube by  _  and visiting the beautiful cities and towns along the way. Besides being a guide, I had to  deal with  files in time, send faxes and  _  other services for clients . In the second week, I worked a lot on the computer and  _  out different little tasks. The people who worked with me were very  _  , and helped me explore different interests. My experience was great,  _  not everybody enjoyed it there. In any case, I  _  you arrange a similar experience for yourself. It's the kind of experience that helps you get to know the world.",
