Dad would always   _  his coins into the jar\nbefore he went to bed: first the jar was  _  and there\nwas a merry jingle and then a  _  sound as it was full.\nEvery time Dad took them to the bank, he would look at me   _  . \"You'll go to college on\npennies, son. This old mill   town's not going to hold you back and you will   _  here\nfor a better life.\" No matter how  _  things got,\nDad continued to drop his coins into the jar. Even during the summer when Dad\ngot  _  from the mill and hadn't enough money to get\nfood for us, not a  _  penny was taken from the jar.\nYears passed, and I finished college. Once, while visiting my parents, I noticed the pickle jar, which had   _  its purpose, gone. My dad was a man of  _  words,\nand never lectured me on determination, faith and alike. The pickle jar had\ntaught me all these  _  far more convincingly.\nWhen I got married, I told my wife Susan about the   _  of the pickle jar. The first Christmas\nafter our daughter Jessica was born, we  _  at my\nparents'. After dinner, Susan carried Jessica into my parents'  _  to diaper (......) her.\n    When Susan came back, there was strange excitement in her   _  . Avoiding being noticed by my parents, she  _  led me into the bedroom. \"Look,\" her eyes  _  me to a spot beside the dresser. To my  _  , the\nold pickle jar stood there, as if it had never been  _  ,\nwith the bottom already covered with coins. I knew it was for my daughter.\nI was too choked with   _  feelings to speak. I just dug down into my pocket and dropped all my coins\ninto the jar.",
