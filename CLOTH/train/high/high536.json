    "article": "It was a warm evening and David Fajgenbaum,the 18yearold freshman had just finished his first football practice at Georgetown University. He   _   his parents,letting them know how well things were going.   _  ,in a soft voice,his father said,\"Son,your mom has brain cancer.\"\n\"I went from being happier than I'd ever been to total   _  ,\"says David.Rushing home,he   _   he was dropping out of college to support his mother through her illness.But Anna Marie Fajgenbaum,just 52 years old,  _   her son return to Georgetown.\nDavid threw himself into his studies and grew increasingly   _  ,feeling he was the only person on campus with a   _   parent. One October evening when David was home visiting,Anna Marie woke up   _  .She was anxious about David and his two sisters.\n\"Mom,I'm going to be   _  ,\"David assured her.\"And I'm going to help other kids cope with   _  .\"A smile spread   _   his mother's face. He   decided on   a support group called Ailing Mothers and Fathers--based on his mom's initials,AMF.\n  _   Anna Marie died later that month,David started hearing from friends who'd never even known his mom was   _  . Some had gone through the same experience. He invited five students who'd lost   _   or friends to his apartment to talk. They   _   to meet every other week and   _   what they were going through. They participated in the Ironman 10K for cancer research,walked to battle ALS,and ran to   _   lung cancer.\nNow the support group has 2000   _    on 23 campuses.\"This organization,\" says David,\"is about one thing:being there for one another.   Every time   I see those initials,AMF,I see my mom. I know she would like that.\"",
