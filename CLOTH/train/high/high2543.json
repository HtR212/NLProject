King Parveez decided to  _  a fish and gave the fisherman 4,000 dirham for it. The fisherman was wild with  _  . He thanked King Parveez and left. Queen Shireen turned to her husband in anger and  _  him for paying so much for a fish. The king said that the fish was purchased and that there was  _  that could be done about it.  _  ,Queen Shireen insisted that the fisherman should be  brought back  . She said, \"We will ask the fisherman about the  _  of the fish. If he answers it is female, we will say we want a male fish and if he replies it is male, we will say we want a female fish! Either way, we will be able to return the fish and have our  _  back.\" So the poor fisherman was called back and was asked the question. Fortunately, he was  _  enough not to be caught out.The fisherman replied, \"This fish is  _  in the sense that it is neither male nor female.\" King Parveez was so  _  by the wisdom of the man that he  _  a further 4,000 dirham to be paid to him. The fisherman thanked King Parveez  _  , but as he was about to leave with the heavy bag of money, one of the  _  fell onto the floor. The fisherman  _  bent down to look for the coin. \"Look how greedy this man is!\" Queen Shireen  _  .\"One coin has fallen out of his money bag and he searches for it instead of leaving it for some other poor  _  in the palace to find.\" The fisherman heard this  _  and said,\"It is not out of greediness that I search for the coin but rather because it had the picture of  _  King Parveez on it.I would not  _  anyone to step on the coin.\"",
