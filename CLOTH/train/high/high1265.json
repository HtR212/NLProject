    "article": "A doctor entered the hospital in a hurry after being called in for an operation. He changed his clothes and went   _   to the surgery   block. He found the boy's father going and coming in the hall   waiting for    the doctor. Once seeing him, the father    _   , \"Why did you take all this time to come? Don't you know that my son's life is    in danger  ? Don't you remember your     _   ?\"\nThe doctor    _    and said, \"I'm sorry. I wasn't in the    _    and I came quickly after receiving the call. And now, I wish you'd calm down so that I can    _    my best.\"\n\"Calm down? What if your son was in this room now? If your son dies now, what will you do?\" said the father    _   .\nThe doctor smiled again and replied, \"Go and pray for your son. We will do our     _   .\"\n\"Giving advice when you're not    _    is so easy,\" responded the father.\nThe surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out   _    , \"Thank goodness! Your son is    _   !\" And without waiting for the father's reply, he ran away quickly. \"If you have any questions, ask the    _   !\"\n\"Why is he so    _   ? Couldn't he wait some minutes so that I can ask about my son's     _   ?\" complained the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor    _   .\nThe nurse answered, tears coming down her face, \"His son died yesterday in a road accident. He was in the burial   when we called him for your son's surgery. And    now that   he saved your son's life, he left running to    _   his son's burial.\"\nThe boy's father was very ashamed. He thought we should never   _   anyone simply because we never know how their life is and what is happening or what they're going through.",
