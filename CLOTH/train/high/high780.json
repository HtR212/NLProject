    "article": "The other day I was talking to a stranger on the bus; he told me that he had a good  _  in Chicago and he wondered if, by any chance, I  _  to know him . For a moment, I thought he might be  _  ,but I could tell from the expression on his face that he was not. He was  _  . I felt like saying that it was ridiculous to  _  that out of all the millions of people in Chicago I could possibly have ever bumped into his friend. But,  _  , I just smiled and reminded him that Chicago was a very  _  city. He nodded, and I thought he was going to be content to drop the subject and talk about something else. But I was wrong. He was silent for a few minutes, and then he  _  to tell me all about his friend. His friend's main  _  in life seemed to be tennis. He was an excellent tennis player , and he  _  had his own tennis court. There were a lot of people with swimming  _  , yet there were only two people with private tennis court; his friend in Chicago was one of them. I told him that I knew several  _  like that, including my brother, who was doctor in California. He  _  that maybe there were more private courts in the country, than he  _  but he did not know of any others. Then he asked me  _  my brother lived in California. When I said Sacramento, he said that was a coincidence  _  his Chicago friend spent the summer in Sacramento last year and he lived next door to a  _  who had a tennis court in his backyard. I said I felt that really was a coincidence because my next-door neighbour had gone to Sacramento last summer and had  _  the house next to my brother's house. For a moment, we stared at each other, but we did not say anything. \"Would your friend's name happen to be Roland Kirkwood?\" I asked finally. He  _  and said, \"Yes. Would your brother's name happen to be Dr Rey Hunter?\" It was my  _  to laugh. \"Yes,\" I replied.",
