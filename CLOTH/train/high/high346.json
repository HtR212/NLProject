Many intelligent people still equate happiness with  _  . The  _  is that fun and happiness have  little  or nothing in common. Fun is what we experience during an act. Happiness is  _  we experience after an act. It is a deeper, more lasting emotion.www.zxxk.com Going to an amusement park or ball game, watching a movie or television, are fun  _  that help us relax,  _  forget our problems and maybe even  _  . But they do not bring happiness, because their  _  effects end when the fun  _  . I have often thought that  _  Hollywood stars have a role to  _  , it is to teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun. These rich, beautiful individuals have constant  _  to glamorous parties, fancy cars, expensive homes, everything that spells \"happiness\". But celebrities reveal the  _  hidden beneath all their fun: depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, broken marriages, troubled children and profound loneliness. The way people stick to the  _  that a fun-filled, pain-free life equates happiness actually  _  their chances of ever obtaining real happiness. If fun and pleasure are equated with happiness, then pain  _  be equated with unhappiness. But,  in fact  , the opposite is true: More times than not, things that lead to happiness  _  some pain. As a result, many people avoid the very efforts that are the source of true happiness. They fear the pain inevitably brought by such things as marriage, raising children, professional achievement, religious commitment, civic or charitable work, and self-improvement.www.zxxk.com",
