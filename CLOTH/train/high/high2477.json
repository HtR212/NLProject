    "article": "College is a big deal for American students as well as for Chinese students. During the college  _  , some parents become extremely worried. This may only  add to  the pressure. Before I applied to the college, I told my parents I would get everything  _  out. If I needed any help, I promised that I would ask them. As it  _  out, I had no problem putting everything together on my  _  , including my resume and a basic outline of my activities in high school. The  _  part where I asked for my parents' advice was the essays. In writing and revising the essays, I needed feedback from an audience. As my parents know me better than  anyone  else, they were  _  for the job. The essays are extremely important in college admissions. In a competitive pool of applicants, the test scores and activities, as well as the recommendations are all going to be very  _  . The essays are the one area in which students can make themselves stand  _  . Essays don't have to be big and complicated. I wrote three essays, all  _  on small matters and using simple sentences. The admission officers have to read hundreds of essays a day; they are already  _  of SAT vocabularies and long sentences.  _  , a straightforward writing style is refreshing to their eyes as well as their minds. Essays were the key to my success in the admission game. I just wrote about what I wanted to say, not what I thought the admission officers  would like  to hear. In my main narrative-style  _  , I told the story of my American journey at the age of 14. During that time, I was not bogged down by trying to fit into a new  _  ; instead, I looked up to Mother Teresa for guidance and strength. I found my new  _  and grew to love the name Teresa and the memories it held. In my two minor essays, I  _  the major events of my life, why I loved writing and why my dad is the person who has the greatest influence on me. Both provided details of my character. The essay about writing, which is titled, \"I Shall Not Live in Vain\" (  _  by an Emily Dickinson poem), earned a lot of praise. It is  _  I really looked into my heart and thought deeply in order to reach my answers.",
