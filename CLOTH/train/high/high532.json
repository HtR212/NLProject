She stood about five-foot-five, was very thin and wore her hair pulled back in a way that gave her a horsy  _  . She wore those half-circular reading glasses. Whenever she got upset, she would lower her head and look at you over the top of her glasses.\nOne day in her class I was busy talking. I didn't  _   she had stopped teaching and was  _   straight at me. \"Young lady, I would like to see you after school.\"\nLater Miss Jordan   _   in a low, but very firm voice that showed she expected me to listen when she was talking. For   _   she told me to write a thousand word essay on education and its effect on the economy . She wanted it in by the following Wednesday. \nWell, I met my deadline. I was   _  . It was a good paper. And I expected a sign of   _   from her. The next day in class,   _  , she was looking at me over her glasses. She called me forward and   _   my paper. \"Go back and rewrite,\" she said. \"Remember, each paragraph is supposed to begin with a topic sentence.\" When she gave my paper back a second time, she   _   the grammar. The third time, the spelling. The fourth time, it was punctuation. The fifth, it wasn't neat enough. I was   _  !\nThe sixth time, I rewrote the whole paper  _  , in ink, leaving generous space. When she saw it, she removed her glasses and smiled. She finally   _   the paper. After that, I put the whole thing out of my   _  . \nTwo or three months passed. One day Miss Jordan came into the class and said to us: \"Class, do you still   _   an essay contest held citywide? They've announced the   _  . I am happy to inform you that Mary has won third prize in the essay contest---'On the Impact of Education on the Economy'.\"\nI was amazed and   _  . It was the first time I had ever won a prize. Years later, I told a reporter that story, and my comments---including my unfriendly  _   of Miss Jordan's appearance. Miss Jordan wrote me, and said that her appearance wasn't what was important. What was important was the   _   I had learnt. When I wrote and rewrote that paper for her, I began to learn how to discipline myself.",
