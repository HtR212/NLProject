The way you look at life will determine how you  _  , how you perform, and how well you will get along with other people.  _  , pessimism creates a sad and hopeless place where no one wants to live.  _  thoughts, attitudes, and expectations feed on themselves.\nYears ago, I  _  into a service station to get some gas. It was a  _  day, and I was feeling great. As I walked into the station to pay for the gas, the attendant said to me, \"You don't look well.\" This took me completely by  _  . A little less confidently, I told him that I had never felt better. Without hesitation, he continued to tell me how bad I looked and that my skin appeared  _  .\nBy the time I left the service station, I was feeling a little  _  . About a block away, I pulled over to the side of the road to look at my face in the mirror. How did I feel? Did I look that  _  ? Was everything all right? By the time I got home, I was beginning to feel a little  _  . Had I picked up some rare disease?\nThe next time I went into that gas station, feeling  _  again, I figured out what had happened. The place had recently been painted a bright but disgusting yellow, and the light reflecting off the walls made everyone inside  _  as though they had hepatitis ! I wondered how many other folks had reacted the way I did. I had let one short  _  with a total stranger change my  _  for an entire day. He told me I looked sick, and before long, I was actually feeling sick. That single negative observation had a(n)  _  effect on the way I felt and acted.",
