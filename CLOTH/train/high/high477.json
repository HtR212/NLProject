    "article": "At age 14, 15 and 16, the way we looked was the most important thing in the world to us. My friends and I wanted nothing less than perfection. \nIn high school, we joined the gymnastics team, and our   _   became even more important to us. We had no fat, only muscle. On the weekends, we would go to the beach,   _   of our flat stomachs. \nOne summer day, all my friends were at my house  _  . At one point, I was running back to the pool. I   _   on a bee, and while it was dying under my foot, it stung   me. I instantly started to feel   _  . That night, I began to run a high fever and my leg and foot were red, hot and swollen. I couldn't walk. I could barely   _  . \nWhen my foot started to go numb, everyone became more   _  . My foot was not getting enough blood. I had to go to the hospital, and my leg   _   as if it were badly broken. I couldn't move. All I could do was think about how soft my middle was becoming. That   _   me more than any concern over my leg. \nThat would all   _  when I heard the doctors mention possibly cutting off my foot. It was still not getting the   _   supply it needed. The doctors would have to speed up their treatment. \nNever before did I have such great   _   for my foot. And walking seemed like a   _   from the gods. Less and less I wanted to hear my friends talk about   _   and who was wearing what. More and more I expected visits from other kids in the hospital, who were quickly becoming my friends. \nOne girl came to visit me   _  . Every time she came, she brought flowers. She was recovering from cancer and felt she should come back and   _   the other patients. \nShe still had no hair, and she was swollen from the medications she had been taking. I would not have given this girl a second   _   before. I now loved every inch of her and looked forward to her   _  . \nFinally, I was improving and soon I went home. My leg was still swollen,   _   I was walking, and I had my foot! When I would go back to the hospital, I often saw my friend. She was still visiting people and   _   good cheer. I thought if there was an angel on this earth, it had to be her.",
