    "article": "I would like to suggest that for sixty to ninety minutes each evening all television broadcasting in the United States be forbidden by law. Let us take a  _  , reasonable look at what the results might be if such a(an)  _  were accepted. Families might use the time for a real family hour. Without the distraction of TV, they might  sit around  together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our  _  ----everything in fact, from the generation gap to the high divorce rate to some forms of  _  illness ----are caused at least in part by  _  to communicate. By using the quiet family hour to  _  our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better. On evenings when such talk is  _  , families could discover more active pastimes . Freed from TV and forced to find their own activities, they might take a  _  together to watch the sunset  _  they might take a walk together.  _  free time and no TV, children and adults might discover reading. There is more entertainment in  a good book  than in a TV program.  _  report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence,  _  at the college level.  _  is often learned from reading. A more literate new generation could be a product of the quiet hour. A different form of reading might also be done  _  it was in the past: reading aloud. The quiet hour could become the story hour. When the  _  ends, the TV networks might be forced to  come up  with better shows in order to get us back from our newly- discovered activities. At first glance, this idea seems radical .  _  will we spend the time then? The fact is: it has been only twenty-five years since television came to control American free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can  _  childhoods without television. It wasn't that difficult.",
