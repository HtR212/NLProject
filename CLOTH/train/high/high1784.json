I know some people wouldn't like to have the thought of  _  money to such strangers in the street,because they thought these people may use that money for drugs,alcohol,or some other undesirable  _  .I started to drive my car away but soon  turned around  .Since I don't usually have much cash on me,I  _  it would be a good idea to offer some food  _  .So I asked him if he was  _  .Hearing my words,he seemed shocked that someone  cared about  his well-being,but he happily  _  it.He said he would like a sandwich and a can of soda. Inside the store,I bought a sandwich,soda,some water and chips.I  _  them to the new friend who was quite  _  to receive so many delicious foods.  _  the meal time ,I asked his name.He said he was called Chewie,and he was thankful for my help.I  _  him a Smile Card.He read it with a big smile and said,\"I always  believe in  random acts of kindness.\" As I drove away,I said a silent prayer that Chewie makes it home for the holidays,or at least he spends them somewhere safe and  _  .",
