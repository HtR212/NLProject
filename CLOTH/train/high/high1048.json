Father and son walked,  _  the farmer did not want the horse to be  too tired  . They met two men on the road  _  said: \"Why are you walking, farmer? You have a horse. It's  a long way  to market.\" The farmer knew that this was  _  , so he rode on the horse,  _  his son walked. Then they met two old ladies. \"  _  are you doing up there, farmer? Can't you  _  how tired your boy is?\"  _  the farmer got down, and his son rode  _  .  _  , three old men stopped them. One said: \"Why are you walking, farmer?  Get up  . It's too hot for an old man like you to walk today.\" So the farmer got up  _  his son, and they  rode on  .  Some time later  , a young woman passed them. \"Why aren't you walking?\" she asked. \"It isn't  _  to market. Give your poor old horse a rest.\" So the farmer, and his son, got down  once again  . It is a fact that you cannot please  all  the people all the time.",
