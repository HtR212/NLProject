Her  _  andenthusiastic letters always   _   my spirits and the inspiring poems she shares with the world always bring a   _   to my face. She is all the more   _  due to the fact that she lost he  _  halfway through her life. She had to   give up  her career and relearn to do everything that most of us take for granted. Many would have given up after such a   _  but not her.  _  , she started a glorious new life full of award winning volunteer work. Her   _   are full of teaching English to new immigrants, giving comfort to   _   hearts, writing, serving her religious community, and helping others in   _   way she can.\nThe light of my friend's example is a beacon  that I try to  _   as well. Whenever I feel too  _  in my own life I look at the challenges that she has   _  in hers. She may have lost her sight but she   _   lost her soul. She knows that the eyes that really see are the eyes of the heart, and she does her best every day to follow the  _  vision that they give to her. I am sure too that their eyes of the angels watching over her are always filled with tears of  _  and that their faces are always full of shining smile.",
