When I was three, my parents flashed cards with Chinese  _  at my face , but I pushed them  _  , my mom believed I would learn  _  I was ready .But the  _  never came. On a Chinese New Year's Eve, my uncle spoke to me in Chinese, but all I could do was  _  at him, confused, scratching my head. \"Still can't speak Chinese?\" He  laughed at  me, \"You can't even buy a fish in Chinatown.\" \"Hey, this is America, not China. I'll get some  right now  with or without Chinese.\" I replied and turned to my mom for  _  . \"Remember to ask for fresh fish, Xin Xian Yu,\" she said, handing over a $20 bill .I  _  the words running downstairs into the streets of Chinatown. I found the fish  _  surrounded in a sea of customers. \"I'd like to buy some fresh fish,\" I shouted to the fishman .But he  _  my English words and turned to serve the next customer .The laugh of the people behind increased  _  their impatience. With every  _  the breath of the dragons on my back grew stronger--my blood boiling--  _  me to cry out . \"Xian Sheng Yu, please\" \"Very Xian Sheng,\" I repeated .The crowd erupted into laughter. My face turned  _  and I ran back home  _  , except for the $20 bill I held tightly in my pocket. Should I laugh or cry. They're Chinese. I should feel right at  _  .

Every laugh is a culture  _  ; every laugh is my heritage fading away .",
