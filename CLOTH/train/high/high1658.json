Then we're dissatisfied that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be more  _  when\nthey are. After that, we're frustrated that we have  _  teenagers\nto deal with. We'll certainly be happy when we are out of that  _  .\n   We tell ourselves that our life will be  _  when we get a nice car, are able to go\non a nice vacation and when we retire.\n   But the   _  is:\nthere is no better time to be happy than right now. Your life will always be\nfilled with challenges. It's best to  _  this and decide\nto be happy anyway.\n   One my  _  quotes   comes from Alfred D. Souza, who said, \"For a long time it had seemed to me life was about to begin---real life. But there was always some  _  in the way.\"\nThis viewpoint has helped me to see that there is no  _  to\nhappiness. Happiness is the way itself. So,  _  every\nmoment that you have now and share it with your loved ones... and  _  that time waits for no one.\n   So,   _  waiting until you finish school, until you go to university, until you\nstart work, until you find a boy or girl friend, until you get married, until\nyou get a new car or home, until you have kids, until your kids leave the\nhouse, until you get  _    ,until you get remarried,\nuntil you retire, until spring, until summer,... until you die, until you are\nborn again to decide that to be happy you have no  _  time\nthan right now.\n   Happiness is a journey, not a(n)   _  .(292)",
