    "article": "The \"challenges\" of family holidays are well-known. It's 21 _  enough getting on with your husband, wife or kids at home, so how can you 22 _  yourself while travelling with them? Susan M. Shaw, expert on leisure   at the University of Waterloo in Canada, thinks the term \"family leisure\" is full of 23 _  . \"Research suggests that such 24 _  do not always live up to the leisure ideal,\" she writes, darkly.\nFamily holidays probably don't add much to the sum of human 25 _  . However, as one of my friends likes to 26 _  , people don't have children for happiness. Research has shown that 27 _ are less happy than childless people. 28 _ , says my friend, having children is best understood as a biological urge. You have them not for the present but for the 29 _ , so that your genes will continue to exist when you are gone. And 30 _ , you go on family holidays not for the present but for the future.\nThus, the aim of the holiday, much of the time, is to stock up on   _   : to leave all family members with   _   of happiness that they can look back on after the family doesn't exist. Much of what we remember of our families comes from 33 _ . On holiday, the family exists more clearly than at any other time: all together for once, 34 _  work, school or friends. On holiday, you are much closer to your 35 _  . Holiday photographs make that feeling of closeness 36 _ . In fact, the photographs themselves are perhaps the main 37 _  of the holiday: that's where the memories get laid down.\nA family holiday is for memories. Once you've grasped that, you will not 38 suffer from  it. I vividly remember, about 30 years ago, 39 _  from an Italian vacation to our handsome brick house.    _   we opened the front gate, my mother said, \"That's the best part of a holiday: coming home.\" At the time I didn't know what she meant.",
