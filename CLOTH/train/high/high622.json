But we soon lost the  _  and started playing with each other. In the 7 grade, I first lost touch with her. She was  going through  family problems and I deserted her to be with the \"cooler people.\"  _  of my new friends liked her as much as I did  _  they knew she had \"problems\". However, every summer we would  _  sit at each other's home and watch soap operas and talk about everything we liked. It was last year when I  _  the problem. I guess I was just too busy in high school to realize she needed someone there for her. Well, she made a new \"best friend\" and  _  did I. Then I didn't know why, but she started cutting herself. She was diagnosed with clinical depression . I was very  _  at first, but with the late night calls, we still stayed in  _  . I wanted to be there for her since her new best friend  _  deserted her, when people were calling her  _  , but I knew I still  cared about  her like a sister. Yesterday she came  _  me and said this,\" I never knew what a best friend was  _  I found you were the only person that would stop me from cutting, the only person that ever made me feel better about myself and my  _  . You don't know this but I was trying to kill myself one night when you  _  me. I  _  you so much, and you didn't even know you were  _  me.\" We both cried. And I guess a kind of lesson from my life so far is to never  give up  your friends.",
