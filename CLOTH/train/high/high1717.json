Then l found a better  _  at a computer store. So I went back to the supermarket to  _  it for some other products. With  _  telling me exactly what to do, I put the ink into a plastic bag, tied it up, placed the bag into a push-cart and started  _  . I was midway  _  when a clerk suddenly stopped me. \"You are not allowed to  _  a bag around in this store. Open it and show me the  _  !\" she yelled coldly.  _  , I opened the bag and  _  the ink to her. \"I'm returning it. \" I said. \"You should have left the bag with the clerk upon  _  . Let me see your receipt!\" she demanded I did as told, looking around, embarrassed  as if  everyone was laughing at me. \"Perhaps in the future you'll learn how to follow the store  _  . \" she added. By the time I finished shopping, I was angry. How dare she treat me as a  _  ? I went looking for her and asked for her  _  . She mumbled something. I asked her again, and this time I heard \"Ursula. \" \"Ursula what?\" I asked. She yelled at me, \"Ursula! \" and stormed away. \"This employee is about to become unemployed, \" I  thought aloud  when I got home. 1  _  their headquarters . I described my unpleasant experience to a representative. She was sympathetic, \"Our employees are taught to be  _  . Give me your phone number and I will ring you back. \" She did two days later. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, \"but there's no Ursula at that supermarket. Can you  _  her so that I can find out who she is? I assure you, we do not tolerate rude behavior, nor do we tolerate  _  to our customers. \" By this time, I had calmed down. l didn't really want the employee to lose her  _  . So I told the representative to forget about it.",
