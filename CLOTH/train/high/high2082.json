After a while, she stopped crying and asked, \"Mummy, am I  _  ?\" \"No, you are not,\" said Mummy, \"but let us discuss this after you  wash up  , OK?\" Several minutes later, Nancy began to have supper with Mummy. \"Who  _  that you are bad?\" asked Mummy. \"Phillips, my friend. He asked me for help with his maths but I  _  because I wanted to read the new book Daddy gave me. He got  _  and said I was a bad girl,\" said Nancy. \"You are  _  ,\" said Mummy. \"Phillips has often helped you with your English. You should have helped him. Why don't you phone him and say  sorry  to him?\" \"But he called me bad and  _  with me. I don't want to go,\" Nancy cried. \"Though you have done  _  bad, it does not make you a bad person. You are  _  a good person.\" Nancy showed a  _  look on her face. \"How can that be, Mummy?\" she asked. \"Our  _  is always good. So never believe that you are bad,\" Mummy replied with a smile.  _  flooded on Nancy's face. \"Am I  _  good, Mummy?\" she asked. \"Yes, you are good, and always will be so. But that does not mean that you should not  pay for  the wrong that you do. You will have to call and  _  to Phillips. Do you understand me?\" \"Yes, Mummy,\" said Nancy slowly. \"Thank you for telling me this. I feel much better now,\" said Nancy  _  . \"I am going to  _  Phillips right away, and I am never going to  _  that I am always good.\"",
