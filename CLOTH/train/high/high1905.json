The following article will tell you how to do it. Making friends is a skill. Like most skills, it improves  _  practice. If you want to meet people and make friends you must be  _  to take action. You must first go to places where there are people. You won't make friends  _  at home alone. Join a club or group, for talking with those who  _  the same experience as you is easier, and  join  them in some activities. Many people are  _  when talking to strangers. After all, meeting strangers means facing  the unknown  , and it's human nature to  _  a bit uncomfortable about the unknown. Most of our fears about dealing with strange people  _  from doubts about ourselves. We  imagine  other people are judging us, thinking us too tall or too short, too this or too that.  _  , don't forget that they must be feeling the same way. Try to accept yourself  _  you are, and try to put the other person at ease. You'll  _  feel more comfortable. Try to act self-confidently  even if  you don't feel that way  when  you enter a room full of strangers, such as a new classroom, walk straight, look  _  at other people and smile. If you see someone you'd like to  speak to  , say something. Don't wait for the other people to  _  a conversation. Just meeting someone  _  doesn't mean that you will make friends with that person. Friendship is  _  on mutual liking and \"give and take\". It takes time and effort to develop. And there are things that keep a new friendship from growing.",
