They had  _  their own businesses for\nyears, first a theatre, then a barbecue restaurant, then another drive-in. But\nin their new operation, they  _  a new, shortened\nmenu: French fries, hamburgers, and sodas. To this basic selection they  _  one new concept: quick service, no waiters or waitresses, and no  _  . Their hamburgers sold for fifteen cents. Cheese was  _  four cents. Their French fries and hamburgers had a remarkable\nuniformity (,), for the brothers had   _  a strict routine for the preparation of their food, and they  insisted on  their cook's sticking to their routine. Their new drive-in became\nunbelievably popular, particularly for  _  . People drove up\nby the hundreds during the busy noontime. The self-service restaurant was so  _  that the brothers had allowed ten copies of their restaurant to be  _  . They were content with this modest  _  until\nthey met Ray Kroc.\nKroc was a (an)   _  . He met the McDonald brothers in 1954,  _  he\nwas selling milk shake-mixing machines. He quickly saw the unusual  _  of the brothers' fast food restaurants and bought the right to open\nother  _  of their restaurants. The  _  included the right to copy the menu, the equipment, even their red\nand white buildings with the golden arches.\nToday McDonald's is undoubtedly a household name.
