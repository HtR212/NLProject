    "article": "One day, a lady bought some bath soaps from a shop. When she opened one of the packets, she found that it had no soap; it was just an empty wrapper! She made a  _  against the factory and got her money back with a successful claim. That being  _  , there was a task before the management of the soap factory. How had this happened? How could they  _  that the incident would not occur again?\nAfter a detailed  _  , it was discovered that during the  _  of wrapping, it so  _  that one or two wrappers did get through without any soap in them! There was no way to  make out  the difference between a full wrapper and an empty one. The process of handling each one separately for this purpose seemed to be very difficult. So, the technical  _  was given the job of finding a method to  _  the problem. The man prepared a detailed report and suggested setting up a computer-based system that would weigh and scan each bar, for the empty packs could not be  _  by a normal x-ray machine.\nThe management heard him out and passed the  _  to release some money to buy the new machinery that he had asked for . An  _  worker said, \"Excuse me, Sir,  _  my rudeness, but I have a  _  that will cost a tiny amount of what you are planning to spend.\"\nThe management  _  in the beginning. But  _  , they heard him out and agreed to try out his suggestion. The next day, the worker brought a strong industrial fan. He put it at an angle near the  _  belt, on which the packed soap bars were coming through, and  _  it on. The few empty wrappers that came through got  blown off  by the fan! A simple solution for a  _  problem!\nThis proves that the educated do not have a patent on good ideas.",
