The only way to understand friendship is through experience, which  _  all the senses. Friendship can be seen. It is seen in an old couple sitting in the park holding hands. It is seen in a child freely  _  the last cookie. It is not  _  to see friendship; it is always there for eyes that can see. Friendship can be heard. It is heard in the words of two friends squeezing in lunch together on an extremely  _  day although they have a lot of things to do. It is the way they  talk to  each other, not the words. Friendship can be heard by those willing to listen. Friendship is  _  in a touch. It is a pat on the back from a teammate, a high five between classes, and the wet kiss from the family dog. The touch  _  more than words or gestures. It is  _  understood and clearly shows the feelings. Friendship has a taste. It tastes like homemade bread: the ingredients all measured and planned, then carefully  _  , then the quiet  _  as the dough rises. Hot from the oven, the bread tastes more than the sum of its ingredients  _  there are the thoughts of the baker as her hands mix the flour or her  _  as she waits for the dough to rise.  _  and unmeasured, this is the ingredient that  makes the difference  . Warm, fresh from the oven, the difference you taste is  _  . Friendship has a smell. It smells like the slightly burnt cookies your brother made especially for you. It smells like your home when  stepping into  it after being away for a long tome. Friendship has  _  smells. Finally, more than the other senses, friendship is a(n)  _  of the heart. It is the language of the heart --- a language that, whether seen, felt, heard, or tasted, is understood by the  _  . Like air fills the lungs, friendship fills the heart, allowing us to experience the best life has to offer: a friend.",
