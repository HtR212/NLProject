His grandson wanted to be just like him and tried to  _  him in every way he could.\nOne day the grandson asked, \"Grandpa! I try to read that book just like you do,   _  I don't understand it, and what I do understand I  _  as soon as I close the book.   What  good  does reading the book do?\"\nThe grandfather quietly turned from putting coal in the stove and replied, \"Take this coal basket down to the river and bring me back a basket of   _     .\"\nThe boy did as he was told, but all the water    leaked out  before\nhe got back to the house.\nThe grandfather laughed and said, \"You'll have to move a little more   _  next time.\" Then he sent the boy back to the river with the\nbasket to try  _     .This time the boy ran faster,\nbut again the basket was  _  before he\nreturned home.\n  Out of breath   , he told his grandfather that it was   _  to\ncarry water in a basket, and he went to get a bucket  _  .\nThe old man said, \"I don't want a    _  of water; I want a basket\nof water. You're just not trying hard enough.\"  This time  he went out of the\ndoor to watch the boy try again.\nThe boy again dipped the basket into the river and ran as hard as he could, but when he  _  his grandfather the basket was again empty. Out of\nbreath, he said, \"See, Grandpa, it's useless!\"\n\"So you think it is useless?\" the old man said, \"Look at the basket.\"\nThe boy looked at the basket and for the first time realized that the basket was   _  .\nInstead of a dirty old coal basket, it was  _  ,\ninside and out.\n\"Son, that's what   _  when you read the book. You might not understand or remember\neverything, but when you read it, you will be  _  ,\ninside and out.\"",
