    "article": "Many language learners think their pronunciation is good enough because their teacher doesn't correct them too often or because other students can   _   them.\nPronunciation is the area which is   _   the least attention to in language learning. Most teachers   _   just let their students speak and stop them   only if   they say something completely wrong. Working on each student's pronunciation in class is just   _  . Also, the students who are   _   at pronunciation may be afraid that it will embarrass their classmates if they help   point out   their mistakes.\nIf you believe your pronunciation is good enough to   _   because it is good enough for your teacher and other students, you may be   _   when you actually go to a foreign country. One of my friends was the best student in his   _   class in Poland. When he went to America, he found Americans didn't understand   _   of what he said.\nYour pronunciation may still be quite   far from   that of a native speaker. If this is the   _  , other people will find it   _   to understand what you're saying and will not be comfortable with you. \n  In conclusion  , don't think you can communicate in a foreign language   _   you've tested your skills on real native speakers.   _  for native or nearnative pronunciation so that people you talk to can communicate with you   _  . In order to achieve this goal, there's   no doubt   that you will need to start thinking about pronunciation and   _   time on it.",
