A young boy out of breath  _  me, all tired from play. He stood right before me with his head tilted   down, saying in great   _  , \"Look what I found!\"\nIn his hand was a flower, and what a   _   sight, with its petals   all worn -- not enough rain, or too little light.  _   him to take his flower and go off to play, I   _   a small smile and then shifted away. But instead of   _  , he sat next to my   _   and placed the flower to his nose and declared with surprise, \"It surely smells pretty and it's beautiful, too. That's why I  _   it; here, it's for you.\"\nThe flower before me was dying or dead. But I knew I must  _   it, or he might never leave. So I reached for the flower, and   _  ,\"Just what I need.\" But instead of placing the flower in my hand, he   _   it midair without reason. It was then that I   _   for the very first time the boy was   _  .\nI heard my voice shake, tears shone like the sun   _   I thanked him for picking the very best one.  He smiled, and then ran off to play,  _   of the effect he'd had on my day.\nI sat there and   _   how he managed to see a self-pitying woman beneath an old willow tree. How did he know of my  _  ?Perhaps from his heart, he'd been blessed with true   _  .\nThrough the eyes of a blind child, at last I could see, the problem was not connected with the world; the problem was me. And for all of those times I myself had been blind, I vowed   to see  _  , and appreciate every second that's mine.",
