    "article": "Most teens I meet these days lack basic social courtesy when dealing with people.\nMy own son, who basically grew up with his grandmother, the original   _   guru, has perfect table manners. This is partly because he was   _  to manners at a very young age. However, when we eat at home, he would not    _  manners. So I asked him why. He said,\" I behave the way I am supposed to   _  when I'm out, but when I am at home I want to be   _  .\"\nThat's when I realized that most parents, myself included, do  _  their children the proper way to behave outside the home, but they are also    brought up  to believe that at home, anything goes.\nMy   _  to him was \"good behavior has nothing to do with where you are or whom you are with\".\nThen he answered, \"But I behave   _  when I'm with others so that they think better of me.\" And that is when I realized that I was doing things all    _  . I explained to him that it had nothing to do with what people think. This   _  him even more.\nSo I went on to explain that behavior, whether in your everyday    _  with people or at the dining table at home, is an    _  of who you are. Well, at the age of 13, he got it.\nSo basically, what I am saying is that teaching your children    _  comes with the underlying lesson that it is not about    _  to do or not to do, but rather, who they are. This way it is not    _  ; it comes from within.\nTeach your teens or children the   _  courtesy of greeting their friends' parents and   _  themselves when they go to someone's home. Teach teenage boys to open the door of a car, or any door    _  that matter, for any girl, whether they are their girlfriends or not. This includes holding elevator doors or letting women step out of the elevator first.\nJust    _  that teenage boys who practice good manners' and courtesy grow up to become men who respect people in general.",
