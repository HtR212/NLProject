    "article": "Last year I was put into a low-level math class at school. The reason I was in this class had     _  to do with my intelligence. I am blind. The\nschool  _  that it would be better for me to learn at a lower\nlevel because it takes me a great deal longer to complete school tasks.\nThe only problem with being in this class was that I was   _  by\n\"at-risk\" students, who did not perform well in school and were  _  in\ntrouble with the school and the law. On Monday mornings, the kids talked about\nwhat they had done during the past  _  . I tried not to listen, but\nit is almost  _  not to. I heard things in that classroom\nthat shocked me.  Even though  the teacher was in the room, that didn't\nstop my classmates from  _  their stories of drugs and\nviolence.\n  Without doubt   I was tired of their rude words. I even began to   _  the\nfact that I had to be here. One Tuesday morning, I went to a Christian Student\nUnion meeting before school, where a guest speaker talked to us about praying\nfor our  _  no matter how much we hated them. I thought a lot\nand began to pray for the kids in my class, asking God to  _  them\nfor they weren't bad kids; they were just  _  .\n  At first   what I did was automatic. When I heard their voices in class, I would pray, \"God, please bless so-and-so ......\" But as I continued, something was growing   _  my heart for them. My classmates gradually\nbecame more than just annoying kids to me. They began to feel like family, and\nI was learning to love them in a way I  _  thought possible.\nI now see that praying is such a   _  act. When I pray for those around me,\nit also  _  my life, and it changes my understanding of\nothers. I realized God's blessings enabled me to see the world through  _  eyes. The prayers I said for others  turned out  to help me\nthe most.",
