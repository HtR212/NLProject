However, my classmates and I still wanted to do a special  _  together that would really serve a good cause. \"We could  _  at a homeless shelter,\" Linda suggested when I asked before class. \"Or send care cards to our soldiers overseas,\" said Kelly. \"And we could  _  joy to our neighbors right here in town.\" \"They're all good ideas,\" I said as we  _  our lesson. \"But which one do we pick?\" At the end of the class, as always, we shared our answers again.

Kelly found two  _  as good as new, one for each of their girls. Brenda and Diane  _  groceries for Christmas dinner and beyond. Stephanie decorated stockings  _  with treats. Then, on Christmas Eve, we  _  a person from a neighboring town to send her all of the gifts, so that we could remain Secret Santas. The first class after Christmas, Katie wore her new dress, and a big smile. By then I think she  figured out  who her Secret Santas were, but if she hadn't, the smiles we flashed back surely gave us  _  .",
