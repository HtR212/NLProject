On  _  days,\nshe wore heavy clothes and a pair of woolen gloves. Summertime  _  out\nneat, belted cotton dresses and a hat pulled low over her sunglasses.  _  ,\nshe was an ordinary working woman. Of course, I  _  all this\nonly after she was seen no more. It was then that I realized how  _  I\nexpected to see her each morning. You might say I  _  her.\n    \"Did she have an accident? Something   _  ?\" I thought to myself about\nher  _  . Now that she was gone, I felt I had  _  her.\nI began to realize that part of our  _  life probably\nincludes such chance meetings with familiar  _  : the milkman you\nsee at dawn, the woman who  _  walks her dog along the street every\nmorning, the twin brothers you see at the library. Such people are  _  markers\nin our lives. They add weight to our  _  of place and\nbelonging.\n    Think about it.   _  , while walking to work, we mark where we are by  _    a certain building, why should we not mark where we are when we pass a familiar, though 55, person?",
