    "article": "John, a famous musician, took his priceless zither and played it in the crowded subway station. The music from the zither was delicately streaming  _  the whole station. However, during the one-hour play only six or seven people truly  _  the charming music. A three-year-old kid was so  _  by the music that he forgot everything around. John only got 52 U.S. dollars for his work that day.  _  , in normal days, when John is about to hold a concert, the ticket can be sold for more than 100 dollars and it is extremely  _  to buy a ticket even at such a high price. Therefore, later, many  _  in the station that day felt deeply regretful for not  _  the famous musician and missing such a valuable but  _  music feast. I have a very busy friend who totally  _  after knowing that his wife came down with a deadly illness. He cooked by himself for the family and took a walk with his wife every day. But his wife still did not  _  to conquer the illness and passed away after three months. After that, he often sighed miserably that  due to  his past busy life, he had missed a lot of beautiful time with his wife. But now it is impossible to  make up for  it. Actually, I also missed something  _  before. The  _  we missed those things is simple: we had thought that we could still own them  _  . Yet tomorrow is actually by no means  _  . There was a famous Buddhist monk saying that in many people's  _  , they had only done two things: waiting and regretting. The result is that they were always too late to  _  what they had. We would often claim to do something when we grow up, or when we have money or when we become old, etc. However, when we reach the  _  we have expected, we could no longer  _  our wish, because we have lost it by then.",
