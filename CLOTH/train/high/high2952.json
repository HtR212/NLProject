    "article": "When I was growing up my dad would often give me small tasks to finish to help out around the house. Some were easy but the three I remember the most were the three  _  of all. The first was helping to weed the four  _  we had. It was  _  work. I would rather ride my bike than crawl in the dirt on my hands and knees  _  the thousands of weeds in our gardens. The second was piling firewood for  _  . It was tough work and I got more than my  _  of pieces. I would rather walk in the woods than piling it in rows. The third was  _  water from a mountain spring to our house.  _  our well water had too much iron in it to  _  .\nOver the years, though, I learned to see the  _  in all the things my dad had made me do. Having fresh vegetables for dinner was a delight.  _  a cold glass of iced ten made from the mountain spring water was a pure  _  . Standing by the wood stove on a snowy December day was a wonderful way to  warm up  . I saw as well that all this work my dad had given me had\n  _  made me a better, stronger and more caring man. Most of all, I  _  that when I did my work with a(n)  _  heart, it didn't fell like work at all.\nOver the years I have learned something else too. When we do the work for our Heavenly Father with a  _  spirit, it doesn't feel like work, either. It feels like. Every act of kindness, word of encouragement, and gift of love we share will only make our lives better, make our hearts happier, and bring out souls  _  to Heaven.\nI am so  _  to both my dad and my Father in Heaven. They showed me the  _  of work and more importantly they showed me the pricelessness of love.",
