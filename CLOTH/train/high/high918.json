    "article": "Elephants practice altruism  . An Indian elephant called Chandrasekharan lifted poles off a truck as it moved along, and placed them in   _   . When Chandrasekharan came to one hole dug in the ground, he   _   to put the pole in.   _   , the owner checked and discovered a dog sleeping in it. Only when the dog was   _   would Chandrasekharan put the pole in. This sort of   _   is typical of elephants. \nElephants really do have long   _   . Elephants eat an incredible variety of foods and need to cover large distances to get it. They need to know   _   to go at what time of year. They learn this and   _   it. They also have   _   communication and societies. They need to remember all the different individuals'   _   and smells so as to be socially adept . The old saying, \"An elephant never   _   ,\" is fairly true.\nI once had a love-hate relationship with an elephant in Zimbabwe in 1991. Every day I'd   _   out of the front gate and an elephant would attack my vehicle. And every day I'd rev  my engine and    _   the door and tell him to get away and then we would go our   _   ways. Every single day this happened without   _   . If other vehicles came and went he would   _   them and then go for mine. \nOne day I went out in a(n)   _   vehicle, stopped nearby and watched for a while. The wind changed, and he caught my smell.   Of course   , he recognized me as usual.\nMore recently it has been   _   that spindle neurons play an important role in the development of   _   behavior. Spindle neurons are found in the brains of humans, great apes, dolphins and elephants.",
