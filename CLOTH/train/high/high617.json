That makes Tanaka  _  of a revolutionary in Japan, where men are  _  known for working long hours and  _  in the bars with clients than mixing baby milk and changing diapers . \"It was  _  , but it was also a lot of fun,\" Tanaka said, sitting  _  the living room floor with his 4-month-old son, Daiki,  _  on his back. \" I saw the first time he  stood up  . It was a great experience.\" Tanaka, 31, is one of a  _  number of fathers in Japan who are taking a bigger  _  inside the home. Men are a  _  sight with kids at parks and zoos at weekends, though often  _  yawning. Books and magazines  _  fathers on how to play with and care for their kids. For Japan's  _  housewives, the changing is too late. In Tanaka's case, his wife, Ayako, 28, was  _  to take a full year of leave , for she was a school teacher.  _  for Tanaka, a department chief at his company had taken the  _  leave a few years before, so his plan to  _  three months unpaid leave was not a total shock to his  _  . Ayako took three months off for Daiki, then it was Tanaka's  _  when she went back to work. Daiki started day care full-time at  _  month. Tanaka said at that time he was able to work again.",
