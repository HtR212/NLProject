The butterfly was freed, got out of the   _  , and moved its wings about   _   could not fly. What the sympathetic person did not know was that only through the   _   struggle can the wings grow strong enough for flight. Its shortened life was spent   on the ground  ; it never knew freedom,   _   really lived.\"\nI call it learning to love with an open hand. It is a   _   which has come slowly to me and has been wrought   in the fires of pain and in the waters of patience. I am learning that I must   _   the one I love, for if I hold firmly and try to control , I shall lose what I try to control   _  .\nAs I learn and practice more and more, I can say to the one I love, \"I love you, I value you, I respect you and I trust that you have the   _   to become all that it is possible for you to become -- if I don't   get in   your way. I love you so much that I can set you free to walk beside me in   _   and in sadness. I will   _   your tears but I will not ask you not to cry. I will care and   _   you, but I will not hold you up when you can walk alone. I will try to listen to your meaning   as well as   your word, but I shall not always agree. I can not   _   be with you or hear what you say for there are times   _   I must listen to myself and care for myself.\"",
