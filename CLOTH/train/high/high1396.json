They found out that the new baby was going to be a girl, and every day Michael sang to his  _  in Mommy's tummy. The days went by. The little girl got  _  after the birth. The doctor told the parents, \"There is very  _  hope. Be prepared for the worst.\" They had fixed up a special  _  in their home for the new baby, but now they  _  a funeral. Michael kept begging his parents to let him see his sister. \"I want to  _  to her,\" he said. If he didn't see sister now, he might never see her  _  . She dressed him in an oversized suit and marched him into ICU, but the head nurse  _  him as a child and shouted. \"Get the kid out of here now! No children are  _  .\" The mother rose up strong, and the  _  mild-mannered lady glared steel-eyed into the head nurse's face. \"He is not leaving  _  he sings to his sister!\" Karen towed Michael to his sister's bedside. He gazed at the tiny infant  _  the battle to live, and he began to sing. In the pure  _  voice of a 3-year-old, Michael sang: \"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray....\" Instantly the baby girl  _  . The pulse rate became calm and steady. \"You never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my  _  away.\" \"The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I  _  I held you in my arms.....\" Michael's little sister relaxed. The medical staff just called it a miracle. Karen called it a miracle of God's  _  ! NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. LOVE IS SO  _  POWERFUL.",
