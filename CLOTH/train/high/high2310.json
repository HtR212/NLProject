    "article": "Appeal to Emotion \nMy childhood left three months ago on a plane to Austria.\nIt was a   _   day when my baby cousins moved away. My cousins were a fundamental part of my life;   _   they were not with me, they were on my mind. They brought back the untroubled days of my childhood,   _   games, adventures and silliness, but they also helped  _   me from an at-times selfish teenager into a responsible adult.\nMy aunt and uncle moved here from Boston with their 1-year-old daughter Yasmeen. They lived in an apartment on the side of our house and I was   _   to have our family, especially a baby girl, so close to us Yasmen had close friendship with each of my sisters, but I knew the one that   _   between us was the strongest. As she began to walk on her own and talk in full sentences, I realized my great   _   upon her. I noticed that she'd   _   some of my unpleasant actions,   _   with her mother after I had done the same. Yasmeen made me realize what being a good   _   really was.\nWhen Maya was born, Yasmeen had a hard time   _  . She was jealous of the attention we all paid to her new younger sister, so I did my best to keep her company when she might have not been   _  . Once Yasmeen overcame her jealousy, she was able to   _  Maya's presence, like we all did. I tried to take advantage of our times together, doing my best to  _   my schedule for my two favorite people.\nMy   _   with Yasmeen and Maya has taught me the importance of influential people. I know that I have helped Yasmeen and Maya   _  , but \"the babies\" have had an even greater influence on my own life. They have shown me how to be a parent, a sister, a child and most importantly, a friend. Our   _   has made me a better person----more patient person, with the ability to  _   endless questions and spilled  juice; an   _   person, able to have fun and be happy with other; a role model,   _   the babies idea about right and wrong, and a compassion person,able to forgive and love.",
