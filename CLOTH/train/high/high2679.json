    "article": "Over the last 15 years, as a doctor, I have had heart-to-heart conversations with countless patients near the end of their lives. The most common emotion they express is   _  . And that's   _   I came up with a project to encourage people to write a(n)   _   letter to their loved ones. It's a lesson I learned years ago from a memorable   _   patient.\nHe was a retired   _  , who had lived on a staple diet of Semper Fi   and studied silence all his life. He, a proud and reserved man, was admitted to the hospital for unbearable pain from widely spread cancer. Every day, his   _   spent many hours at his bedside watching him watch television. She explained to me he had never been much of a   _  in their 50-plus years of marriage.\nBut he seemed quite   _   to share his ideas with me, especially when it became clear his days were   _  . He spoke of his deep regret for not having spent enough time with his wife, whom he loved very much, and of his great 50 _  in his son, who had joined the Navy in his father's footsteps.\nOne afternoon, when I mentioned these   _   to his wife and son, they looked disbelievingly at each other and then   _   at me. They thanked me for being so kind but   _  my patient was unlikely to express such feelings. To make sure his family could actually hear his   _  , I took my huge family video camera with me the next morning and with the patients'   _  , recorded an open letter from him to his family. When I gave them the   _   letter, both his wife and son were moved to tears.\nThe experience   _   an idea that has grown into the Stanford Friends and Family Letter Project, which can help people complete their life review tasks: remembering treasured moments; apologizing to those we may have hurt;   _   those who have hurt us and saying \"I love you\".\nIt may take tremendous courage to write a life review letter. For some people, it   calls up   deep and troubling emotions.   _   it may be the most important letter you will ever write.",
