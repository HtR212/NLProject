    "article": "A group of frogs were jumping through the woods when two of them fell into a deep hole. All of the other frogs  _   around the hole to see what could be done to help their   _  . When they saw how deep the hole was, the rest of the group   _   that it was hopeless and told the two frogs in the hole that they should prepare themselves for their fate , because they were as good as   _  .\nUnwilling to accept this terrible fate, the two frogs began to jump with all their   _  . Some of the frogs shouted into the hole that it was   _  , and that the two frogs wouldn't be in that   _   if they had been more careful.\nThe other frogs continued   _   shouting that they two should save their   _   and give up, since they were already as good as dead. The two frogs   _   jumping as hard as they could, and after several hours of hopeless   _   they were quite tired.\nFinally, one of the two frogs followed the calls of his fellows. Disheartened, he lay down at the   _   of the hole, and died as the others looked on in helpless sorrow. The other frog continued to jump with every bit of energy he had,   _   he was completely worn out.\nHis companions began a new shouting to him to accept his fate, stop the pain and   _   die. The frog jumped harder and harder and, wonder of wonders, finally jumped so   _   that he sprang from the hole.   _   , the other frogs celebrated his unbelievable freedom and then gathering around him and asked, \"Why did you continue jumping when we told you it was impossible?\"   _   their lips, the astonished frog explained to them that he was deaf, and that when he saw their gestures and shouting, he thought they were   _   him on. What he had got as    _   inspired him to try harder and finally succeeded.\nThis simple story contains a powerful lesson. Your encouraging words can   _   someone up and help him or her make it through the day.",
