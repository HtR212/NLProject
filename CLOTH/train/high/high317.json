It was a transitional time in Daniel's life. I wanted to leave him some words of  _  . But nothing came from my  _  and this was not the first time I had let such a moment  _  . When Daniel was five, I took him to the school-bus stop on his first day of kindergarten. He looked at me -- as he did now. \"What is it going to be like, Dad?
