I'm sweating and   _  , and if my lungs weren't black and cloudy, I would be screaming. Flashes, light, flames here and there, and for a second I think I am   _  .\nWe run back and forth, side to side looking for a   _   out with our painful blind eyes. Things are blowing up in the next room. I can't think about anything. I can't   worry about   my brothers. My mother's crazy screams can't get to me.

I wonder if to her this brick house replaces our old green house. In my heart it doesn't   _  .\nI've shared with you the darkest of my life. I am much better now.
