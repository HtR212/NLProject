His mother had been  worried about  him spending Christmas on the road  _  and had given him a box filled with  _  . His mom still  _  him like a kid, though he was a driver now. He reached into the stocking and  brought out  a toy tractor that looked a lot like his truck. He wondered how many stores his mother had to go before she found such a close match.  _  filled his eyes.\nHe climbed out of his cab   and ran into the all night cafe,  _  which many truckers were eating and talking. And a family of three were huddled   in a corner, tired and  _  .\nTrint  felt sorry for  the boy. No kid should have to spend Christmas Eve in a truck stop.\nTrint missed his family. His mom raised four kids by herself,  _  no matter how  _  life was, she'd always made sure they had a good Christmas. Then he  thought of  his box in the truck.\nHe looked at the kid again and knew what he had to do. He forced himself into the  _  outside to open his truck.
