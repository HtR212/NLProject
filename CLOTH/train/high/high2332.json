It was 21 _  to me that she was lying, staying in the 22 _  all day long to catch the next fool.\n\"She was 23 _ !\" I screamed. \"Why did you give her anything 24 at all ?\"\nMy father looked at me and I could 25 _ that he was a bit angry.\"And what would you like me to 26 _  ?\" he said, \"Should I tell her that I am a college professor and that I can 27 see through  her cheating?\" I did not 28 _ him at all, and then he told me 29 _  that I would never forget.\"First, she would not do this if she did not need the 30 _ .Second, I made her happy, because now she thinks that she is 31 _  than me, and I do not mind that.I think that is more 32 _  to her than the money.\"\nA week later, we were at the same 33 _ , and the same woman came up to my father with the same 34 _ .\"Not this time,\" my father told her, \"In your business, you have to learn to 35 _  people.Try another story on me next week.\"\nWell, he was a professor, after all...and I like both sides of this story: generosity  and wisdom.",
