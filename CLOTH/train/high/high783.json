    "article": "When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor named Doctor Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard, but was always very  _  . When Doctor Gibbs wasn't   _  lives, he was planting trees. His house   _  on ten acres of land, and his life's   _  was to turn this land into a forest. The good doctor had some  _  theories about planting trees. He believed in the principle:\"No pain, no gain\". He never watered his new trees, a(n)   _   which is contrary to  _  wisdom.\nOnce I asked why and he told me that watering plants   _   them because it made them grow weaker. He said you have to make things tough for the trees so that only the strongest   _  . He talked about how watering trees made them develop  _  roots and how, if they were not watered, trees would grow deep roots   in search of  moisture .So Doctor Gibbs would plant an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he'd beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's   _  .\nDoctor Gibbs died a couple of years after I left home. Every now and then, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him   _  some 25 years ago. They were tall and   _   .\nI planted a couple of trees myself a few years ago. Two years of coddling these trees meant they grew up weak. Whenever a cold wind blew, their branches   _   .Adversity  seemed to benefit Doctor Gibb's trees in ways comfort and ease   _   could.\nEvery night before I got to bed, I   check on   my two sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies. I often pray that their lives will be easy. But lately I've been thinking that it's time to   _  my prayer. I know my children are going to   _   hardships. There's always a cold wind blowing somewhere. What we need to do is to pray for deep roots so when the rains fall and the winds blow, we won't be   torn apart  .",
