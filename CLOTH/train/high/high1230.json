Twenty-one years later I am still a bright-eyed  _  and one with quite a different tale to tell.\nMy grandma, a(n)  _  woman, graduated from college at the age of 65. She was the first in our family to reach that  _  . But one year after I entered college, she developed cancer. I made the choice to withdraw  from college to  attend to  her. This meant that school and my personal dream would have to  _  .\nThen I got married with another dream: building my family from a  _  of adopted  and biological children. In 1999, we adopted our first son. A year later came our second adopted boy.  _  , the following year, we adopted son number three. In 2003, I gave birth to another boy.\nYou can  _  how totally occupied I became, raising four boys under the age of eight! Our home was a complete zoo-a joyous zoo. Not surprisingly, I never did  _  it back to college full-time. But I never  gave up  my dream either. I had only one option: make it work. That meant taking as  _  as one class each semester.\nThe hardest part was feeling  _  about the time I spent away from the boys. They often wanted me to  _  home with them. There certainly were times I wanted to  _  . But I knew I should set a(n)  _  for them to follow for the rest of their lives.\nIn 2007, I graduated from the University of North Carolina. It took me over 21 years, but I got my college degree!\nI am not  _  , just single-minded. It always  _  me that from the  _  , challenges look huge, but when you're in the midst of them, the same ones seem  _  . Not everything you want arrives in your life in one day. It's a (n)  _  . Remember: little steps can lead to big dreams.",
