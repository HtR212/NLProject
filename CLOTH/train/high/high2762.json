    "article": "In the 1960s, Douglas McGregor, one of the key thinkers in the art of management, developed the mow famous Theory X and Theory Y. Theory X is the idea that people instinctively  _  work and will do anything to avoid it. Theory Y is the view that everyone has the potential to find satisfaction in work.\nIn any case, despite so much evidence to the  _  , many managers still agree to Theory X. They believe,  for example  , that their employees need constant supervision if they are to work effectively, or that decisions must be imposed from  _  without consultation. This, of course, makes for authoritarian   managers.\nDifferent cultures have different ways of  _  people. Unlike authoritarian management, some cultures, particularly in Asia, are well known for the consultative nature of decision-making--all members of the department or work group are asked to  _  to this process. This is management by the collective opinion. Many western companies have tried to imitate such Asian ways of doing things, which are based on general  _  . Some experts say that women will become more effective managers than men because they have the power to reach common goals in a way that traditional  _  managers cannot.\nA recent trend has been to encourage employees to use their own initiative, to make decisions on their own without  _  managers first. This empowerment   has been part of the trend towards downsizing:  _  the number of management layers in companies. After de-layering in this way, a company may be  _  with just a top level of senior managers, front-line managers and employees with direct contact with the public. Empowerment takes the idea of delegation   much further than has  _  been the case. Empowerment and delegation mean new forms of management control to  _  that the overall business plan is being followed, and that operations become more profitable under the new organization, rather than less.\nAnother trend is off-site or  _  management, where teams of people linked by e-mail and the Internet work on projects from their own houses. Project managers evaluate the   _  of the team members in terms of what they produce for projects, rather than the amount of time they spend on them.",
