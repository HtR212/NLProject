Then the tiger  _  the fox to the place  _  it had met the donkey. When the fox saw the donkey, it laughed and said, \"That's only a  _  donkey and it only eats  grass  . Come, let's kill it  _  supper. When the donkey saw them  coming along  , it quickly  got  a plan. \"Hello, old friend! How nice to see you, and how nice  _  you to bring me supper, my favorite food -- tiger meat.\" Hearing this, the tiger was very  _  as well as angry. \"I'll teach you a lesson.\" It  _  angrily at the fox, and  _  one jump, killed it.
