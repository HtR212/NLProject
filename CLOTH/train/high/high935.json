Frank said to his parents that he would  _  to see a friend.  _  it was cold outside, Frank put on his new jacket and took presents on his new sled . As Frank walked, he saw a house with the  _  hanging over a fireplace. A woman was seated near them  _  . The stockings reminded Frank of the ones beside him and his brother. A sudden thought  _  Frank. So he knocked on the door. \"  _  ?\" the sad voice of the woman answered. \"May I come in?\" \"Please\" she said, seeing his  _  full of gifts, and thinking he was making a collection, \"but I have no food or gifts for you. I even have  _  for my own children.\" \"That's not why I am here,\" Frank replied. \"Please  _  any present you like for your children from this sled.\" \"Why, God bless you!\" the  _  woman answered. She chose until the stockings were full. \"Won't you tell me your  _  ?\" she asked. \"Just call me the Christmas Scout,\" Frank replied. The visit  _  the boy touched, with an unexpected  _  in his heart. He understood that his sorrow was not the only sorrow. He  gave away  all the gifts, including the new jacket. \"Where are your presents, Frank?\" asked his father as he  _  the house. \" I handed them out to other children.\" \"Frank, how could you do so?\" his mother asked in anger. The next morning, he came downstairs and  _  his parents listening to Christmas news on the radio. Then the announcer spoke: \"Merry Christmas! Several families  _  their children were made happy by the gifts from a boy. No one could  _  him.\" Frank felt his father's arms go around his shoulders, and he saw his mother smiling  _  her tears.",
