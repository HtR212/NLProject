You're going with me to cut grass.\" The idea   _  my father\nactually thought I was big enough to help him in his  _  made\nme feel proud and  _  . From sunup to sundown my father, my\nyounger brother and I  _  in the large yards in a rich part of Atlanta, Georgia. By the end of the day I was tired out, but\nfelt good. I had  put in     a hard day's labour and had earned $6.\nOne day my father found some leaves I'd   _  and\npulled me aside. \"Clear away these leaves,\" he said  _  , \"and\ndon't make me have to tell you to do it again.\" The  _  was\nclear. Today I value the importance of doing a job  _  the\nfirst time. It will never  _  to impress the person you are\nworking for.\nAfter two years my father told me and my brother that he felt we were  _  enough\nto do lawns  on our own. Every Saturday , we  _  out early in the morning\nwith the same desire and drive we had gained while working  _  our\nfather.\nTaking care of lawns was not exciting  or  high-paying, but\nthat didn't matter. It taught me that any job is a good job and that  whatever  I was paid was more than I had before.\nA newspaper reporter once asked me how someone   _  possible\nlive on a forty-hour- a -week minimum  pay. \"My father never worked just forty hours a  _  , and neither have I.\" I replied. \"If you're only working forty\nhours, you probably don't want to do  _  better than you're\ndoing.\"\nIn every job I've  _  ------from doing lawns to washing dishes-----I\nhave learned something that helped me in my next job. If you  _  hard\nenough, you can learn from any job you do.",
