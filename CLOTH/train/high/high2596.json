She is eight years older and has already made it into \"real world\".\n         My sister bought me three wonderful gifts,   _  only one\nwould capture my heart forever. First she handed me the  _  . Because Amy is careful with her actions, I knew this was her least\nfavourite. It was a bottle of perfume. I was happy  _  it,\nyet  _  as to what lay ahead. Next she handed me a box.\nAfter  _  away the wrapping paper, I found a stylish and\nexpensive sweater. I was deeply moved that my sister was so  _  .\nThen she handed me the  _  gift.\nJudging by the familiar size and   _  , I knew it was a CD. It was the soundtrack to the movie \"Rocky\", with\nsongs inspiring to all athletes, dreamers...I  _  loved\nit, but not as much as I would after what my sister explained to me.\n         She was referring to a knee injury   _  cost me half\nof my soccer season. I desired to be with my team-mates and  _  each\nminute I sat on the bench. I tried hard, hoping my knee injury would heel soon.\nThis was  _  led my sister to buying that CD.\n         After mentioning what was behind the   _  , Amy played the CD\nfor me.  Even though  I had heard those songs a thousand\ntimes, each note struck me as if it was new. It played in my soul and on my\nemotions. I  _  breathlessly, as the words \"Trying hard\nnow. It's so hard now\" sounded through the room. It touched me in a way beyond\nthe happiness most gifts  _  bring. I couldn't  _  crying and hugged my sister.  Knowing  that\nmy sister had felt my problem so deeply made me realize that I am the  _  little sister in the world. I had never received a gift with so much  _  behind it!I'll cherish it forever.",
