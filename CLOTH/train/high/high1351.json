    "article": "One of the most common social fears is that we are not good enough. Perhaps you feel you won't   _  others\nbecause they are more confident, successful, intelligent or attractive than\nyou. Such thinking is misguided. The  _  of doing\nwell is accepting yourself as you are.\nWhen I was a student, I kept a diary filled with  _  memories. Some were painful memories from  _  when I felt hurt, confused, lonely and insecure. I  _  pieces of dreams and personal feelings of anger and hatred,  as well as  things I enjoyed such as magic shops and coin dealers.\nThen a terrible thing happened.   _  dinner one night I realized I had left my diary in the cloakroom outside the campus dining hall.   _  that somebody might read it and find out the truth about me, I  _  back, but it was gone.\nWeeks passed, and eventually I gave up hope of ever finding it   _  . A month later, I was 46 _ up my jacket in the same place when I saw my brown  _  diary, just where I'd left it.\n  _   I read through the pages and found that a   _  had written the following, \"God bless you. I'm  a lot  like you, only I  _  keep a diary, and\nI'm  _  to know there are others like me. I hope\nthings turn out well for you.\"\nTears came to my eyes. I had never thought that any one could know my inner feelings and also   _  things\njust like the way I did.\nNo matter what you are like, whether you're rich or poor, brilliant or   _  , attractive or plain,\nthere are people like you. Get rid of your fears of not being good enough, and  _  yourself as you are.",
