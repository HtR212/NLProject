In June 2006, when I joined St Xavier's College, Mumbai, for my 56 _  degree in mass media, it felt like Papa's classes. Soon I was writing regularly for the news magazine Outlook. In 2009, it was Papa again who 57 _  me decide not take a postgraduate degree in mass media.\n\"You'll only study the 58 _  things again,\" Papa explained. \"Sociology is such a lively subject, and if you want to be a good journalist you 59 _  know about society and people.\"\nI got my MA in sociology two years later.\nThis Father's Day, June 21, when I called him, I will have completed nearly four fruitful years working as a journalist, thanks to Papa's 60 _ .",
