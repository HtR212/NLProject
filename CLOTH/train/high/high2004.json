Bonus and I weren't scholars either.  On the contrary  , we hated studying from the very beginning. We were  _  to spend time with our schoolbooks---out of the fear of Mum's scolding. I almost did not make it to 10th grade. That entire summer Mum  _  that I read my schoolbooks from the very first chapter till the last. I left  _  college at 18. In my second year of college, while I was studying for my final exams, I got a phone call from Mum  _  my sister had failed her 9th grade exams. Mum was heartbroken. My mother was an English teacher in a famous school in the city and it was a(n)  _  for her. Then started another  _  for my Mum. There always seemed to be people who would come and talk about how well their children were doing  _  my mother would be having a tough time making sure we stayed on the right path. Mum was  _  that we would do well for ourselves. She never let my sister and me  _  that we had lost out on something and always told us: \"Let this be a lesson. We are going to work really really hard...  _  will change.\" Things did change, but very slowly and  _  , one little step at a time. Last year I finished with law school and started working. My mother's belief in me  paid off  . And just a few days ago I got a phone from Bonus. She had  _  the exam with honors and was  _  to the best university in the country. I was in tears. Later that night I  _  Mum: \"Mum, your two little failures didn't do as badly as everybody thought.\" Mum  _  and said: \"You are my daughters and I knew you the best. I always knew that you would succeed. It was just a  _  of time.\"",
