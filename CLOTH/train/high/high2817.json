    "article": "My Forever Valentine\"\"\nValentine's Day was the time my father chose to show his love for the special people in his life. Over the years I fondly   thought  _  him as my \"Valentine man\".\nMy first recollection of the  _  he could bring to Valentine's Day came when I was six. That morning at the breakfast table I found a card and a gift-wrapped package at my chair. The card was  _  \"Love, Dad\" and the gift was a ring with a small piece of red glass to  _  my birthstone, a ruby  . There is  _  difference between red glass and rubies to a child of six, and I remember  _  that ring with pride that all the cards in the world  _  not surpass  .\n  _  I grew older, the gifts gave  _  to heart-shaped boxes filled with my  _  chocolate and always included a  _  card signed \"Love, Dad\". In those years my thank-you became  _  of a perfunctory   response. The cards seemed less  _  , and I took for granted that the Valentine would  _  be there. I had  _  my hopes and dreams in receiving cards and gifts from \"significant others\" and \"Love Dad\" just didn't seem quite  _  .\nHis final card remains on my desk today. It's a  _  of how special fathers can be and how important it has been to me over the years to know that I had a father who continued a  _  of love with simple acts of understanding and an ability to express happiness over the people in his life.\nThose things never  _  , nor does the memory of a man who never  _  being my Valentine.",
