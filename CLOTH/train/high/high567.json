Three happy-go-lucky video makers decided to provide some  _  to passengers returning to San Francisco Airport in the U.S. and  _  \"free hugs\". The group, from Canada  _  in the \"arrival\" gate with the  _  \"you deserve a hug\" chalked up on a board. And their  _  act actually moved one man to tears after they played another by  _   Happy Birthday\".  _  smartly with the board in their hands, they seem to be  _  by the passengers. Passengers walk past, focusing on their mobiles, their  _   ,or friends waiting, to avoid being offered a(an)  _  .\"Everyone thinks we're Uber drivers ,\"says Thomas Brag.\nAfter the \"awkward beginning\",  _  ,things take a  _  turn. Their first hug comes from a woman in a yellow jacket. Passengers began to  _  the group with smiles, although some appear still puzzled. One female passenger appears  _  to be offered a free hug, jumping over to the three men, and being raised into the air.  _  passengers became more receptive. Family members waiting for their loved ones to  _  began directing the group to greet incoming passengers. A tender  _  is then shown as the men greet one man, who is called Ani, with a(an)  _  performance of \"Happy Birthday\". \"This week we were lucky to be flown out to San Francisco,\" reads the video description on the group's YouTube channel. \"We realized how   _  we were to be together and have someone greet us.\"\n\"So we decided we'd try and make some lone travelers' days  _    welcoming them like they were part of our big happy family.\"",
