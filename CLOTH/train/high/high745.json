Five dollars\nwould buy almost a week's groceries for his family.\n   Reuben would   _  the five dollars and not tell anybody.Reuben had an  _  .People built their own homes with nails bought in hessian sacks  .Sometimes the sacks were    thrown away  , and Reuben knew he could sell them to a local factory for five\ncents a piece.\n    That day he found two sacks, which he took to the factory and sold.The boy's hand  _  grasped\nthe five-cent coins as he ran the two kilometers home.Reuben found an empty soda tin and dropped his coins inside.Then he   _  the tin beneath a pile of sweet smelling hay .\n    It was dinnertime   _  Reuben got home.His mother, Dora, was at the kitchen stove, ready to   serve  dinner as Reuben took his place at the table.He looked at his mother and smiled.Slim and beautiful, she was the   _  of\nthe home, the glue that held it together.\n     Every day after school, Reuben searched the town,   _  the\nhessian sacks.All summer long, Reuben continued his   _  task.Then all too soon the garden was harvested, the leaves  _  and the winds blew cold.Reuben wandered the streets,   _  searching for his Hessian treasures.Often he was    _  , tired and hungry, but the\nthought of the object in the shop window kept him going,\n     Finally spring burst into glorious green and Reuben's spirits erupted.The time had come! He ran to the hay and   _  the tin can.He poured the coins out and began to count.Then, grasping the tin can, he   headed for  the shop.\n     Racing home with his treasure, Reuben   burst through  the front door.\"Here, Mum! Here\" Reuben called loudly as he ran to her side.He placed a small box in her work-roughened hand.She unwrapped it   _  , not to break the\npacking paper.A beautiful jewel box appeared.Dora opened the box, tears beginning to fill her eyes.On a small brooch   was the word Mother, in gold letters.\n     It was    Mother's  Day, 1946.Dora had never received such a gift; she had no jewel except her wedding ring.Speechless, she smiled brightly and gathered her son into her arms.",
