Each tomato will be given a name of a person that the child  _  , so the number of tomatoes that a child will put in the plastic bag will depend on the number of people the child hates. So when the day came, every  _  brought some tomatoes. Some had two; some three while some up to five tomatoes. The teacher then told the children to  _  with them the tomatoes in the plastic  _  wherever they go. Days after days passed by, and the children started to complain due to the  _  smell let out by the rotten tomatoes. Besides, those having more tomatoes had to carry  _  bags. After 1 week, the children were relieved because the game had finally ended. The teacher asked: \"How did you  _  while carrying the tomatoes with you for 1  _  ?\" The children let out their frustrations and started  _  of the trouble that they had to go through having to carry the heavy and  _  tomatoes wherever they go. Then the teacher told them the hidden meaning behind the  _  . \"This is exactly the  _  when you carry your hatred for somebody inside your heart. The unpleasant smell of hatred will pollute your  _  and you will carry it with you wherever you go. If you cannot tolerate the smell of rotten tomatoes for just 1 week, can you imagine what is it like to have the smell of hatred in your heart for your lifetime?\" So  _  others is that best attitude to take!",
