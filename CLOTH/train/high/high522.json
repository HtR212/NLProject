Sometimes, the families are abusive toward the child and they   run away  .\"\n               Zach did the walk between his studies.  It took him three years to   _   his walk, which he began when he was only eight years old.  He   _   20 kilometers a day.  No matter how   _   he got, Zach says he felt he had to   _  walking. Along the way, Zach visited homeless   _    , helping plant the gardens - all kinds of stuff, \"just getting to play with the kids,\" he says, \"  _   making at least one day of their life better.\"\nZach has a long   _  of helping others.
