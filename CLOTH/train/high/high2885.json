    "article": "Isn't it amazing how one person,sharing one idea,at the right time and place can change the course of your life's history?This is certainly what happened in my life. When I was 14,I was a high school dropout   with learning disabilities.\nOne day I met an old man,a bum  .He asked me if I was running away from home,because I looked so   _  .Then he told me he had something grand to show me and   _   with me. We walked to the downtown library.\nThe bum first brought a couple of old   _   and then started with a few statements that were very special and that changed my life. He said,\"There are two things I want to   _   you. Number one is to never   _   a book by its cover,for a cover can fool you\".\nHe followed with,\"I'll bet   you think I'm a bum,don't you?\"\n\"Yes,I   _   so,sir.\"\n\"Well,young man,I've got a little   _   for you. I am one of the   _   men in the world. I have probably everything any man could ever want. But a year ago,my wife   passed away  ,and since then I have been deeply reflecting on life. I realized there were certain things I had not yet experienced in life,one of   _   was what it would be like to live like a bum on the streets. For the past year,I have been going from city to city doing just that. So,you see,don't ever judge a book by its cover,for a cover can fool you.\n\"Number two is to learn how to read. For there is only one thing that people can't   _   away from you,your wisdom.\" He   _   my right hand and put it upon the books he'd   _   from the shelves,the writings of Plato and Aristotle's everlasting   _   from ancient times. His   _   request was for me to never forget what he taught me.",
