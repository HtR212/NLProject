    "article": "I was at the post office early that morning, hoping to be in and out in a short while. Yet, I  _  myself standing in a queue that went all the way into the hallway. I had never seen so many people there on a weekday. It seemed someone might have made an announcement,  _  customers to carry as many packages as they could. I also needed to have my own package  _  . The queue moved very slowly. My patience  ran out  and I got annoyed. The longer it took, the angrier I became. When I got to the counter finally, I finished my  _  quickly and briefly, and then walked past the queue that was now extending past the front door. \"Excuse me,\" I said, trying not to be too pushy. Several people had to move  _  to make room for me to get to the  _  . I stepped out,  _  about the service conditions. Thinking I was going to be late for my dentist appointment, I  _  into the parking lot. A woman was coming across the lot in my  _  . She was walking with determination, and each step sounded very  _  . I noticed that she looked as if she could breathe fire. It stopped me in my tracks. Had I looked like that? Her body language said that she was having a  _  day. My anger melted away. I wished I could wrap her in a  _  but I was a stranger. So I did what I could in a minute  _  she hurried past me-I smiled. In a second everything changed. She was astonished, then somewhat  _  . Then her face softened and her shoulders  _  . I saw her take a deep breath. Her pace slowed and she smiled back at me as we passed each other. I continued to smile all the way to my car. Wow, it's amazing  _  a simple smile can do. From then on, I became aware of people's  _  and my own, the way we show our feelings. Now I use that  _  every day to let it  _  me that when facing the world, I can try a smile.",
