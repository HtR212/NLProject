    "article": "When our restaurant business failed, we headed north in a camping truck to Texas, hoping to have a \"fresh start\". At the  _  of Palo Duro Canyon State Park, I  _  a job advertisement hiring park hosts. The position offered a  _  , permanent campsite in the park, and  in return  , the hosts served as a link between the park's guests and the rangers . It was the perfect solution: a rent-free place to reorganize our lives. We entered the park and I made an  _  for the following day. The park was  _  , so it took us some time to find an available site. That evening, as we finished our dinner, my wife saw two large skunks walking toward our table. We  _  climbed onto the table and, for the next four hours, waited for them to  _  our camp. Having survived that night, we were  _  that everything else would be all right. The next day we met with the people who ran the park. They explained our  _  and gave us a beautiful campsite. That evening,  _  , we learned about the canyon  _  . They were strong and cold, rocking our little camping truck violently, and we lay  _  in the dark until the winds died away.  _  the weeks that followed, we learned to survive in our truck and  live on  the little money my wife  _  by substitute teaching. Building a successful business and then losing it had left very little time for building a successful  _  . For a time after our business  _  I thought I might lose my family as well. Living in the tiny  _  with no television, we sat close together reading and talking. One evening, standing under a jeweled sky, I found myself  _  for all the hardships. We had walked the trails and climbed the canyon walls. We had become a family!",
