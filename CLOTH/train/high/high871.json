    "article": "I was born and raised in Minnesota, the USA, but as an adult I have mostly lived in Europe and Africa. I teach cross-cultural management at the International Business School near Paris. For the last 15 years, I've studied  _  people in different parts of the world build trust, communicate and make decisions  _  in the workplace.\nWhile travelling in Tokyo recently with a Japanese  _  , I gave a shorttalk to a group of 20 managers.  At the end  , I asked whether there were any questions or comments. No  _  went up, so I went to sit down. Mycolleague whispered to me, \"I think there  _  were some comments, Erin.Do you mind if I try?\" I agreed, but I guessed it a waste of  _  . He askedthe group again, \" Any comments or questions\".\nStill, no one raised a hand,  _  this time he looked very carefully at each person in the silent audience. Gesturing to one of them, he said, \" Do you have  _  to add?\" To my amazement, she  _  \" Yes, thank you.\" and asked me a very interesting question. My colleague repeated this several times  looking at  the audience and asking for more questions or comments.\nAfter the session, I asked my colleague, \" How did you  _  that those people had questions?\" He  _  , not sure how to explain it, and then said, \" It has to do with how  _  their eyes are.\"\nHe continued, \"In Japan, we don't  _  as much direct eye contact as you do in the west. So when you asked if there are any  _  , most people were not looking directly at you. But a few people in the  _  were looking right at you and their eyes were bright. That  _  that they would be  _  to have you call on them.\nI thought to myself I would ever have learned from upbringing in Minnesota. Since then, I try to  focus on  understanding behavior in other cultures I encounter, and keep finding the bright eyes in the room.",
