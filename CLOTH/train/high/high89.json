    "article": "This morning I was in an unfamiliar town to cheer myself up. I had stopped at a gas station to get some gas  _  I left to go home. I was not in a good 37 _ . I have very impractical ideas and therefore have  suffered from  mild depression  on occasions.\nI walked up to the entrance of the building to   pay for  my gas and stopped to read a bulletin on the door  _  , \"Please help me attend the Special Olympics this year by donating .\" As I walked  _  , I saw a lovely young girl with Down Syndrome . She spoke to me very   _   and asked if I could donate to her cause. I politely   _  and told her that I didn't have cash on me at that time. Although secretly I knew I  _  easily get cash from the ATM. I just wasn't in the mood. So after paying for my gas, I   moved off   out of the gas station and the girl waved me goodbye.\n  _  I was walking back to my car, the girl's words rang in my ears and I was  _  by guilt. I knew I was able to   _  . And although I was in a bad mood before,  _  seemed to disappear. I wasn't upset anymore.  _   I thought about before stepping into my car was that lovely girl who deserved to have her moment to   _  . My next action was obvious. I walked back into the   gas station   and headed towards the ATM. I   pulled out   the $20 dollar bill and handed it straight to her.\nShe was wild with   _  . She looked at me and gave me a huge smile and thanked me again and again. I accepted her   _   and walked out of the building smiling wider than I had in a very long time.",
