High-tech Company NEC has  come up with  a device that it says will  _  users to communicate with people of different  _  Shaped like a pair of eyeglasses  _  without the lenses , the computer-assisted Tele Scouter would  _  a picture-forming device to present almost real-time translations directly onto the  _  retina . The text, provided  _  through voice recognition and  _  programs, would effectively provide movie-like \"subtitles\" during a conversation between two people  _  the glasses. \"You can keep the  _  flowing,\" NEC market development official Takayuki Omino told reporters at Tokyo exposition  _  the device was on display. \"This could also be used for talks  _  with secret information,\" says Omino,  _  that there would be no need for translators. Each user's  _  words would be  picked up  by microphone, translated, and be instantly  _  for conversation partners in  _  visual texts and as audio delivered through headphones. Users can still see their conversation partner's face because the text is  _  onto only part of the retina--the first time such technology is used in a commercial product, according to NEC. The company plans to put the Tele Scouter in Japan in November next year,  _  at the beginning without the translation mode.",
