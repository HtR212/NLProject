    "article": "It is  _   for adults to forget how hard and dull and long school is. The learning by  _  of all the basic things one must know is a most incredible and endless effort. Learning to read is probably the most difficult and revolutionary thing that happens to the human brain and if you don't believe that, watch an illiterate  adult try to do it. School is not easy and it is not for the most part very much    _  , but then, if you are very    _  , you may find a real teacher. Three real teachers in a lifetime is the very best of my luck. My first was a science and math teacher in high school, my second, a   _   of creative writing at Stanford, and my third was my friend and partner, Ed Ricketts.\nMy three have these things   in common  : they all loved what they were doing. They did not tell, and   _   they catalyzed  a burning desire to know. Under their   _   the horizons grew wide and fear went away and the unknown became knowable. But most important of all, the truth, became beautiful and very    _   . \nI shall speak only of my first teacher because   besides   the other things, she brought discovery.\nShe   _   us to shouting, book- waving discussion. We could never   stick to   the subject. Our guesswork ranged the world. She breathed   _   into us so that we   brought in   facts or truths protected in our hands like seized fireflies.\nShe was   _   and perhaps rightly so, for   _   to teach fundamentals. But she left a passion in us for the pure knowable world and she inflamed me with a curiosity which has never left. I could not do simple arithmetic but through her I sensed that abstract   _   was very much like music. When she was fired, a sadness   came over   us but the light did not go out. She left her   _   on us. I have had many teachers who 60 _  in me a new thing, a new attitude and a new hunger. I suppose that to a large extent I am the unsigned manuscript  of the high school teacher.",
