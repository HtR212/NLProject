At least,for me,there is a lot to see in the view from my kitchen window.\nIt was a spring day,and I was washing the dishes when I happened to  look out  of the kitchen window into the backyard. My husband,Mike,was out cultivating the garden with a  _  . Our son,Jeremy,who was four years old at the time was right  _  him. Mike was moving the plough very  _  in order to do a good job of breaking up the soil for  _  . My son was just inches behind my husband and each time Mike took a step,Jeremy took a step. He would carefully put his own small  _  in the huge footmark  _  from my husband's boot. He took a  _  with his right foot and then his left and then he would wait  _  for when it would be time to take the next step. Although Jeremy didn't know it,his father had been  _  over him all the time,even when he stumbled   and  _  . That view from my kitchen window has  _  in my mind until this day. In one way it is a  _  of the need of a child for a father's good example.\nIt is also an illustration for all of us. How many times I have walked ahead of my father,  _  to find dry and hard ground that I couldn't  _  because it hadn't been ploughed yet. I got into  _  because I didn't wait for my father to go before me and  _  the way.\nAt other times,I became  _  of waiting for the next step and began looking around at all the rocks of the world that led me to  _  my road. Like Jeremy,all I needed was to turn around and  _  my eyes on my father who had also been watching over me all the time.",
