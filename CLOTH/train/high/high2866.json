When he told his own desire to his friends and relatives, some of whom laughed at him, and some even held down his enthusiasm  _  . \"I must change it.\" said the boy angrily, \"I believe I can speak very  _  , I will do!\" When it was possible, he would spend an hour  _  to chickens. He viewed the chickens as living persons,  _  himself to be the person in the speech. \"In the beginning, the chickens looked so  _  , then they watched me curiously, putting down the food in the mouths and listening to my words. It seemed as if they had been  _  by my powerful and effective language. Sometimes they seemed to be listening to me  _  . Gradually, the effect of this practice became more and more  _  and I had a better understanding of the exact  _  of my stammer, so I found the ability to speak more.\" \"You may not know that my father was always tyrannical . He  _  believed in the old saying: 'Young man should be more knowledgeable, but should not  _  much.' During the whole childhood,  _  I spoke or commented, he criticized me seriously, which  led to  my shy personality. I used to worry about being  _  at, so I became a stammer. From then on, I kept  _  in front of everyone because they didn't want to see my embarrassment. But later I found myself talking in front of chickens, stammers disappeared  _  , therefore I regained my  _  \" Now, the previous boy is the best at speaking and one of the most  _  missionaries. You can hardly imagine he used to have a serious language  _  . So when you come across disadvantages, you should believe you can  _  them by yourself.",
