    "article": "Once upon a time when there was a famine  , a rich baker sent for twenty of the poorest children in the town, and said to them, ''In this basket there is a loaf for each of you.  _  it, and come back to me every  _  at this hour till better times come. ''\nThe hungry children  _  eagerly around the basket, and quarreled for the bread,  _  each wished to have the largest loaf. At last they went away without even  _  the good gentleman. But Gretchen, a poorly-dressed little girl, did not  _  or struggle with the rest, but remained  _  modestly in the distance. When the ill-behaved children had left, she took the  _  loaf, which alone was left in the basket,  _  the gentleman's hand, and went home.\nThe next day the children were as  _  as before, and poor, shy Gretchen received a loaf only nearly half the  _  of the one she got the first day. When she came home, her mother cut the  _  open, many new, shining pieces of silver fell out of it. Her mother was very much  _  , and said, ''Take the money back to the good   _  at once, for it must have got into the loaf  by accident  . Be quick, Gretchen! Be quick! ''\nBut when the little girl gave the rich man her mother's  _  , he said, ''No, no, my child, it was no  _  . I had the silver pieces put into the smallest loaf to  _  you. Always be as contented, peaceable, and   _  as you now are. Go home now, and the  _  is your own. ''",
