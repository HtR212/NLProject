I'll  _  you every day, mom and I will love you even more each day . Some day we will see each other again.\nI want you to  _  a little boy , you won't be so  _  .He can have my room and my old things to play with . If you decide to get a  _  instead , she probably wouldn't like the things as we boys do , so you have to buy her  _  and stuff that girls like .\nDon't be  _  when you think about me .This is really a great place .Grandma and Grandpa met me as soon as I got here and  _  me around some good places . The angels are so  _  ,and I love to watch them fly . I got to sit on God's knee and talk to him like I was somebody  _  . I told God that I wanted to  _  you a letter and tell you good-bye and everything , but I knew that wasn't  _  . God secretly handed me some paper and his own personal pen to write to you this letter with .  I think Gabriel is the name of the angel that is going to drop this  _  off to you .Oh , by the way Mom , nobody else can see what is written on this paper but you . To everyone else , it is just a blank sheet of paper .\nI almost  _  to let you know-now I don't  _  any more because the cancer is all gone. I'm glad because I needn't stand that pain any more . God himself couldn't stand to see me suffer the  _  either , so he sent The Angel of Mercy to get me .",
