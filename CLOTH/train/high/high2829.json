    "article": "Dawson was an old grouch  , which everyone in town knew. Kids knew not to go into his yard to pick a delicious  _  , even off the ground, because old Dawson, they said, would come after you with his gun.\nOne Friday, 12-year-old Jane and her friend Amy were on the way to Amy's house, but as they got close Jane saw Dawson sitting on his front porch   and  _  they cross over to the other side of the street. She was  _  of the old man because of the stories she'd heard about him.\nAmy said not to worry, Mr. Dawson wouldn't hurt anyone.  _  , Jane was growing more nervous with each step  _  to the man's house. When they got close enough, Dawson looked up with his usual frown  , but when he saw Amy, a broad  _  changed his entire face as he said, \"Hello, Miss Amy. You've got a little friend with you today.\"\nAmy smiled back and told him Jane was staying overnight and that they were going to play games. Dawson said that sounded fun, and  _  them each a fresh apple off his tree. They gladly accepted. Dawson had the best apples in town.\nWhen they got  out of  Dawson's earshot  , Jane asked, \"Everyone says he's the meanest man in town.  How come  he was so nice to us?\"\nAmy explained that at first he wasn't friendly and she was afraid of him, but she  _  he was wearing an invisible   smile, so she always smiled  _  at him. It took a while, but one day he  _  -smiled back at her.\nAfter some more time, he started smiling real smiles and then started  _  to her. Just a \"hello\" at first, then more, and now always plus an apple.\n\"An invisible smile?\"  _  Jane.\n\"Yes. My grandma said if I pretended he was smiling an invisible smile at me and I smiled back, sooner or later he would really smile. Grandma says  _  are contagious  .\"\nWe're always  on the go  trying to accomplish so much, getting groceries, cleaning the house, mowing the lawn... It's so easy to get  caught up  in everyday life that we forget how  _  it can be to bring cheer to ourselves and others. Giving a smile away  _  so little effort and time. Let's make sure that we are not the one that  _  have to pretend is wearing an invisible smile.",
