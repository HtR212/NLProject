I was always  _  of the last days\nof a month, during which many bills were waiting for me to pay. Now the   _  month\nwas going\nto end. When I   went over  the monthly bills, I saw I couldn't  _  what my\ngirls wanted.\n         I still remembered what I had   _  my daughters. For our first\nChristmas in a  _  state, far\nfrom the rest of our family, I wanted to get my daughters, Tiffany and Jasmine, something   _  .\n\"What do you want from Santa this year?\"\n         \"Bicycles!\" they replied at once.   _  they had their hopes set. But after\nI got the monthly bills, I  _  the money left was not enough\nfor one bike. What could I do to get two? I turned the matter over in my  _  several times: Lord, would it be fair to my landlord to be  _  with the rent this month? Just this once?\n         Over the next few   _  I always asked myself the same question when my\ndaughters were deep in sleep.  _  the only voice I heard was\nmy grandpa's: \"Diane, whatever you do, always pay your rent on time,\" he  _  to say.\n         I guessed I had my   _  . I slipped the rent check under the landlord's door and\ncalled the girls in. The phone rang when I was about to break the bad  _  .\n         \"I want you to   listen to  something,\" my landlord said. I heard the sound of\npaper breaking. \"That was your December rent check,\" he said. \"It is being  _  into a million pieces because you always pay your rent on time. Merry\nChristmas to you and the girls.\"\n         Grandpa's kind   _  , a generous landlord and some unknown reasons had added\nup to a Christmas gift that my daughters and I will never forget.",
