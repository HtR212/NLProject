    "article": "In Florida for Thanksgiving, I was surfing the channel guide for CNN, hoping to find out whether a decision had been reached in the Michael Brown case (the case of a police officer who shot an unarmed teenager Michael Brown on Aug. 9, 2014). I said, looking at the television screen, \"I hope they   _   him.\"\nMy mother's tone pierced   the   _   . \"Why, why would you hope for that?\"  I exhaled  , knowing I was about to have   _   uncomfortable conversation with my mother, the retired   _  .\n\"He was unarmed, ma,\" I said to her. \"   _   he was a kid.\"\nTo her, even if only for a moment, I was just another asshole   on the street. I   _   it in her face, and it was terrible. She said   _  , \"You don't know the whole story, you haven't seen the evidence. Whether you like it or not, cops are innocent   _   proven guilty too.\"  I stayed   _   as she continued.  \"And he wasn't a kid, he was   _  . What if that was me facing Michael Brown? I wouldn't have 51 _  a chance.\"\nMy5'8''mother couldn't have 52 taken down  a 6'4''man without a weapon. I would want her to pull out her gun and fire until she came home to me because that's my mom and it's my job to get crazy when I think of her in   _   .  Just like when I   _   the man who slapped her in face and knocked her to the ground, bile   rises in my throat. \nThis is my lived experience. I 55 grew up  in a household where my mother and stepfather wore guns and   _   . They always came home with   _   ; some we could hear, and some 58 _  in the kitchen. We gathered together at night with my two younger sisters to watch TV as a family: \"Rescue 911,\" \"America's Most Wanted,\" \"Law & Order,\" all the 90s cops shows. We watched \"Picket Fences\" until the one   _   where the cop killer got off, and my mother and I had our first uncomfortable conversation when I said he might be   _   . After that, we had to boycott the show.",
