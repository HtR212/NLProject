Writing had become therapy for me.I took that poem, along with many others I had  _  during my breast cancer period and placed them in book form.I was  _  enough to have that book published.I later had another inspirational children's book  _  ,with a third one  on the way  .I'm hoping that anyone who has the chance to read my first book of poems will benefit from it.
