I picked him up and  _  he must be freezing to death. I  _  home with the cat held in my jacket. My new best friend, who soon became known as Little Bit, received his name because he was almost  _  when I held him in my hands. He stood about five inches tail. Little Bit' s small size had a great advantage -- he  _  perfectly in the pocket of my jacket, which made  _  him everywhere very easy. Any time I was home, he wouldn' t leave my  _  . He was always eager to play with me. When I fell asleep at night, he would always roll up around my head to keep me  _  . Unfortunately, I grew up. My teenage life  _  my relationship with Little Bit. I lived at such a fast pace that I stopped making time for him. My free time was spent with my  _  instead. I would come in the house on my phone and not  _  him at all. His meows became an annoyance to me, but it wasn' t his fault that he  _  his best friend back. Time had caused a  _  to Little Bit. His body began shutting down and by the time I realized  _  was wrong with him, he had already lost his balance. He lay there and looked at me, and  _  this day I still remember the  _  look in his bright green eyes. I took him to the vet , but there was nothing he could do. The last time I  _  him he wasn' t the same tiny cat I had found ten years before. Little Bit filled my arms and he was put to sleep that day.

I will always  _  the special memories we made.",
