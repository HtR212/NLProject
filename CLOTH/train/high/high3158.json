This inspiring neighbor of mine often   _   my mind working. I regarded it as my best friend 44 _ .\nHowever, when I opened the window one morning, to my amazement, the tree was almost 45 _ beyond recognition as a result of the storm   _  the night before. I was seized with a sudden sorrow at the thought \"all the flowers are to fall\". I could not help  _  with emotion: the course of life never runs  _    ,for there are so many ups and downs   as well as  twists and turns. The process of my life saw my beloved friends parting one after another. Isn't it   _  to the flowers falling off the tree in the wind?.\nThis event   _  from my memory as time went by. One day after I came home , I found the the room hard to breathe in and opened the window  _  . Something outside caught my  _   and impress me. It was a plum tree with flowers   set off  beautifully by the sunset. The surprise discovery filled me with pleasure. I wondered  _  I had no idea of some tough life restarting over the fallen petals when I felt sorry for the hibiscus.\nWhen the last petal   _  , all the admiration for the hibiscus disappeared as if nothing was left, until the landscape was again decorated with the red plum flowers to   _   people of life's alternation and continuity. Can't it be said that life is actually a symphony, a harmonious 58 _ of loss and again.\nStanding by the window lost in thought for a long time, I realized that no scenery in the world remains   _   .As long as you keep your heart bathed in the sun, every dawn will present a fine start for you and the world will always be about  _  hopes. \n    Tell anyone who has inspired you how they have inspired you.",
