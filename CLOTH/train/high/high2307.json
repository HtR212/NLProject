    "article": "This past Thanksgiving Day the boss of the company I work for decided to serve a Thanksgiving meal for the poor. I couldn't  _  this and decided that I wanted to  _  ! I could deliver foods and send out my smile card.\nI arrived at my  _  around 11 and found a line of families waiting outside the doors. I wasn't sure  _  I wanted to give my card to because there were so many people there  _  I knew I wanted to give it to a mother.\nI served  a number of  table plates of turkey with all the fixings and slices of pumpkin pie for desert. Everyone was so happy and honestly seemed  _  for what my co-workers and I were doing.\nAt my last  _  there was an older lady with about eight kids. She looked tired, but  _  that her children were  _  . Smiling at her, I exchanged a few words  _  her and knew that she was a foster mom  and that  even if  she would have liked to cook at home she couldn't  _  it because of the size of her family. She then thanked me for  giving up  time with my family to serve hers.\nShe burst  _  a smile and gave me a hug  _  I gave my smile card to her.\nAt the end of the day I didn't think about how I gave up time with my  _  to do this because I got so  _  out of this special and unforgettable experience,  _  made me so incredibly thankful for  _  I have and I now realize it is important to give back, and not just on the holidays.",
