At his funeral, his brothers began to   _  stories about their lives. They recalled their childhood, when they were poor and  _   in the countryside, their hunting adventures in the woods and their happy family get-togethers   _   festivals. In their eyes, my grandfather was understanding and kind-hearted. He was always there,  _  happiness to the family.

I pulled my mother aside.\n\"Grandfather is dead. How can they laugh?\" I said in  _  .\n\"What is the most important thing you   _   about your grandfather?\" my mother asked. \" He wouldn't want us to be  _  . That's not how he would want to be remembered. He would have wanted  _  this kind of party.\"\nI  _  . Out of all the things I remember about him, the most  _  thing is his laughter.
