Perhaps you've tracked how many kilometers you've run, how many hours you've slept or how many calories you've   _   in a day.\nIf so, you've   known about   a movement called the \"Quantified Self Movement.\" Individuals gather information about their daily activities in this widespread movement, also called self-tracking. This may sound   _  , but technology is making the process easier.\nPerhaps you've wanted to   _   a bad habit and couldn't. Self-tracking may be our answer. The idea is to take information about your everyday activities and analyze it to help get a   _   lifestyle.\nRecently, tools such as smartphones, journals and apps, along with newly   _   wearable gadgets  , are making self-tracking extremely easy. Today, one can use Fitbit, the Jawbone UP, Google Glass or a smart watch to   _   personal data including hours slept, stress levels, heart rate and mood.\nSo why does a person self-track? Someone may be trying to lose weight or improve their sleep patterns. Another person feels tired after eating. Self-tracking could help him to   _   what foods make him sleepy and modify his diet accordingly.\nMonitoring daily activities isn't a new concept. In years past, athletes and their coaches kept notes detailing nutrition, training and sleep patterns in order to achieve an athletic goal.   _  , doctors have also helped patients to document parts of their lifestyles and eating habits to help fight allergies  , headaches and other health issues.   _  , it wasn't until 2007 that Wired magazine editors Gary Wolf and Kim Kelly, who started tracking every move they made, coined the   _   \"Quantified Self.\"\nAlthough self-tracking has many advantages, Dennis Nash, president of Data Speaks Health Solutions, says self-tracking has its   _  . Once people start tracking their daily activities, it can become an addiction. Also, they might begin to worry too much about their health.\nWhile self-tracking doesn't   _   that one's quality of life will improve, it can highlight the importance of eating well and exercising daily.   After all  , the quantified Self Movements' primary focus is   _   people to employ enough energy to make healthier choices.",
