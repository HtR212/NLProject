    "article": "It often appears that we have more to gain by speaking than by listening. One big advantage of speaking is that it gives you a chance to  _  others' thoughts and actions. Whatever your goal is -- to have a boss hire you, to  _  others to vote for the person of your choice or to describe the  _  you want your hair cut ...the key to success seems to be the  _  to speak well. Another  _  advantage of speaking is the chance it provides to  _  the admiration, respect, or linking of others. Tell jokes, and everyone will think you're really a  _  man. Tell them all you know,and they'll be  _  by your wisdom. But keep quiet, and it seems as if you are a  _  person. Finally,talking gives you the  _  to release energy in a way that listening can't. When you're  in trouble  , the chance to talk about your problems can often help you feel better. In the same way, you can often  _  your anger by letting it out orally. It is also helpful to  _  your excitement with others by talking about it,  _  keeping it inside often leaves you feeling as if you might burst.  _  it is true that talking does have many advantages,it's important to  _  that listening can do good to listeners, too. As you'll soon read, being a good listener is one good way to  _  others with their problems; and what better way is there to have others  appreciate  you? As for controlling others, it may be true that it's hard to be persuasive while you're listening, but your  _  to hear others out will often make them open to your ideas  in return  . Listening is often reciprocal . \"You get what you give.\"",
