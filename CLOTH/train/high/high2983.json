    "article": "It was New Year's Night. An aged man was standing at a window. He had already  _  sixty of the stages leading to it, and he had brought from  his journey nothing but errors and remorse.\nThe days of his  _  appeared like dreams before him, and he recalled the  _  moment when his father placed him at the entrance of the two roads.--one leading to a peaceful, sunny place,  _  with flowers, fruits and resounding with soft, sweet songs ; the other leading to a deep, dark cave, which was endless.\nHe looked towards the sky and cried  _  , \" Oh, my youth, return! Oh ,my  _  , place me once more at the entrance to life, and I 'll  _  the better way!\" But both his father and the days of his youth had passed away.\nThe clock in the high church tower struck and the sound made him remember his  _  early love for him. They had taught him and prayed to God for his good. But he chose the wrong way. His darkened eyes were full of  _  , and with a despairing effort , he burst out a cry, \"Come back, my early days! Come back!\"\nAnd his youth did return, for all this was only a  _  which he had on New Year's Night.\nThose who still linger on the  _  of life, hesitating to choose the bright road, remember that when years pass away and your  _  stumble on the dark mountains, you will cry bitterly, but in vain, \"Oh , my youth, return! Oh , give me back my early days! \"",
