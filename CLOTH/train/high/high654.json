My wife,Qugen, and I are  _  he has other kids to be with and we have  _  and encouraged him to play with his friends. We also want Kevin to learn  _  ,so we have asked him to tell us  _  he's going and to come home at a specified time. The  _  started when Kevin didn't come home on time. On one occasion,I asked Kevin to be back at 6 pm. By 6:30,I needed to go  looking for  him. I found him at a friend's house,and he looked  _  that he couldn't continue playing. After we came home,I sat Kevin down for a talk about the  _  of keeping his word. I told him I was not worried about him arriving a few  _  late,but after half an hour,I'm going to be  _  . He told me he understood. The next day,I came home from work at about 6:30 p.m. and Qugen asked me to go and get Kevin  _  she said he should be back home at 6. I walked to his friend's house and a look of  _  appeared on Kevin's face when he came to the door. At  _  ,Qugen and I spoke to Kevin about why he didn't come home on time again. He said he just wanted to  _  playing. This was  _  ,so Qugen and I decided to ground him for a week. This  _  no playing with his friends. For the next week,whenever his friends came to ask for Kevin,we let him  _  to them that he was grounded. We felt this would help him be responsible for his  _  . As a  _  ,I believe one of the most important things we can teach our kids is self-responsibility and that actions have consequences.",
