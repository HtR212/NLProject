The bird was so  _  that she had to walk on the ground instead of  _  in the sky. Though she couldn't fly, she  _  looking up at the trees every day. She  dreamed of  one day being able to fly and see the  _  forest from up high.  _  , that dream was gone after a great fire. When the fire was  _  put out, all that was left of the trees were stumps .  _  plants and animals that had live there were gone. The stone bird was the only one that didn't  _  in the fire. When she saw what had  _  to the trees, she felt very sad. Looking at the burnt trees, she couldn't  _  crying. She cried for hours and days. She cried with such a feeling that her  _  were wearing away her stone  _  . Finally all her body was worn away and the bird had  turned into  some water. But when the  _  came out, the water rose into the sky and became a happy little cloud which could fly over the trees and see everything  _  . Since then, the little cloud has traveled all over the world. She enjoyed the  _  of all the forests and beautiful countryside. She never  _  what had burnt the trees, so she was very careful to pour her rain down on any tree she saw  _  . She saved a lot of trees.",
