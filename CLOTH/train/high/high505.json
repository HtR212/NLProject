Then,  _  his shoes are ready, he goes back to the shop, gives the ticket to the shoemaker, gets his shoes and  _  for them. One day Mrs. Smith gave her husband a  _  of her shoes which needed mending and asked him to  _  them to the shop. Mr. Smith did so, and put the  _  for them in his pocket. He went back four days  _  to get the shoes,  _  when he went into the shop, he was not able to find his ticket  _  ,and the shoemaker did not want to give him the  _  until he got the ticket. \"How do I know that the shoes are  _  unless you give me the ticket?\" he said. \"If I give them to you now, somebody  _  may come into my shop with the ticket tomorrow, and then I shall not be able to give him the shoes.\" Mrs. Smith needed the shoes very much, so her husband  _  for a moment and then went out to his  _  , which was at the side of the road  _  the shop. He  _  the door, and whistled to his wife's small  _  , which was sitting on the back seat. Then he went back into the shop and  said to  it, \"Get the shoes!\" The dog began to  _  around the shop, and soon it found Mrs. Smith's shoes and brought them to Mr. Smith one after the  _  . \"That should prove that they are my wife's.\" Mr. Smith said. The shoemaker  laughed  and then he gave the shoes to Mr. Smith.",
