He was happy to earn enough to  live on  from day to day.\nHe was very   _  at climbing coconut trees. One day he was walking through a coconut plantation . The owner of the plantation  _  him,\"Good afternoon, my friend,\" the owner said, \"Do you want to earn some money by climbing for coconuts?\"\n\"  How much  will you give me?\" replied the lazy man.\n\"I'll give you two nuts from  _  tree you climb,\" the owner said, \"And there are twenty- five trees.\"The lazy man  _  . He started to climb one of the trees. When he  _  the top, he said to himself: \"There are twenty - five trees. That means there will be fifty nuts for me. If I sell the nuts, I'll get enough money to buy twice as  many  cheap nuts. Then I will boil the nuts and  take out  the oil. After that I will sell the oil and make a lot of money.\"\n\"  Using  the money, I will buy many chickens. The chickens will grow up and lay many eggs. The eggs will hatch into chickens. I will take care of the chickens.  In time  those chickens will grow up and lay  _  eggs. They too will hatch into other chickens.\n\"I will then sell all the chickens and make a big profit. With the money, I'll buy some  _     presents and a ship. I'll go to  _  country. There I'll ask a princess to  marry  me ...\"\nAs he was talking to  _  , the lazy man moved from side to side. He was  _  . He forgot that he was up on a tree. He let go off the  _  and fell to the ground.He died at once.",
