    "article": "Recently, I was invited to a writing class at my old high school. I accepted the  _   because it's always fun to see what young writers are up to. A few hours before the class, I got the     _   that I often get before I go into a school -- nausea  and the fear that I'm about to get into   _  .\nWhen I  _  into a school, all the old feelings come back:  some  teacher is going to get mad at me; the headmaster is going to make me take a note home.\nBut I'm not alone in having  _  feelings from school days. Often people talk about bad     _  they still have about being unprepared for a(n)   _   test. Others say that being picked on and not being  _   for a team are still terrible memories for them. So it's no   _   that adults sometimes act like they're still in school.\nMy   _   memories are about teachers getting mad at me. I was often ashamed of the serious crime of \"talking out of turn\", a guy who couldn't keep his   _   shut.\nI realize that the answer is to face the feelings,   rather than   avoid them. So I volunteer at a school once a week. Each week, I'm a little more   _   when I walk into the office to   get up  . And I admit that sometimes when the headmaster   _   me with a smile, I think he's planning to call my mother to say I should dress a little nicer   _   I visit his school. But by the end of my time there, I feel    _  .\nNow I'm   looking forward to   my next volunteer day at school. In fact, I might get there a little earlier so I can spend   _   more time there.",
