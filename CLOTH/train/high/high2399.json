I pulled over,48 _  a bowl of fruit for $7,told her to keep the   _   and immediately turned to give the   _   to the man.As I jumped back into my car to rush to work,the lady stopped me and gave me a(n)   _   fruit bowl! I know she had it hard financially.So I refused but she  _  I take it.\nWhen I got to work I took a different   _   that I don't usually use,which passed my favorite store,so I   _   to say good morning to the ladies working there.The ATM was right there,and as I passed,I   _   stepped on a $10 bill lying on the ground! I   1ooked around   but there was no one who just used the ATM.I asked the girls in the store if they may have  _   it and they said no,and told me it was a  _  so take it.    \nLater,during lunchtime,a coworker said she'd brought too much food and   _   me half.Another coworker had the same problem so we had a   _   feast!\nYou get what you give,and blessings come just when you need it.",
