He had a  _  at a restaurant and only visited us once every couple of years.\nBefore I moved, I knew that people in the US spoke English. But  _  , I didn't stop to analyze the situation when I was  _  to leave . Just like I assumed I could easily become a doctor or a lawyer. I assumed that I had the skills to learn  _  in a few weeks.\nWhen I  _  in the US and started 8th grade at Ditmas Middle School in Brooklyn, everyone was  _  a(n) foreign language I couldn't understand. I  _  that life had subtitles , like in foreign movies.\n  _  was such a serious place here. Sometimes I felt like I was in a geek  class. The teachers were always watching  my moves so I couldn't even throw a paper ball at a classmate's head. And the  _  thing was having to read newspaper.\nBut after almost seven months of  _  about everything, I realized that complaining didn't change things. It just made my life worse. If I was going to  _  in this new concrete jungle, I had to  adapt. I began to learn English by reading newspaperson my own after  _  . After about four months, I started enjoying reading the crime and sports stories. After six months of studying, my teachers notice my  _  and moved me into a more modern English class. I could go to the storeand ask for things that I wanted to buy  _  any frustration. For the first time I felt like I was living on earth again because I didn't hear  _  talk. I could understand people.",
