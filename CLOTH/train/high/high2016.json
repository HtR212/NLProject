When I finally  _  to open the door, I  _  around the wall for a light switch. I found a  _  where a switch was once installed... but no switch. No discouraged easily, I remembered seeing a  _  by the bed when I put away my luggage  _  in the day. I found the bed in the dark and felt around until I found the lamp, but when I switched it on,  _  happened! Now what? Though I knew that it was dark outside my window  _  the outdoor light was burned out, I thought that  _  if I opened the curtains I might be able to use the light from the  _  to find another lamp. So I  _  my way slowly across the room to the curtains and... no draw-string! I finally stumbled around until I found a desk lamp that actually  _  ! That evening I discovered in a whole new way just how dark the world can be and how necessary  _  is. But even more necessary than  _  light is the light that shines from people----the light of love, sympathy and  _  . Because, for many people, the world is a dark and  _  place. It is the shining that is important, for someone today just may be stumbling in discouragement or fear and in  _  of some light. So let your light shine. Whatever light you  _  may be a beacon of hope and encouragement in someone's darkness. And if you feel that your light is  _  a candle in a forest, remember this----there isn't enough darkness in the world to  put out  the light of one small candle.",
