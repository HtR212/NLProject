    "article": "One winter term during college, I took a history class to fulfill a requirement. The professor was a  _  fellow with red hair. He would walk shyly into the room wearing his hooded winter coat, once not even  _  the hood during the lecture. He was terribly nervous in class and lowered his head  _  looking up through his glasses at his students. So I  _  a little game for myself. I would try to find something in his lecture to ask him an intelligent question about,  _  me to pay attention rather than letting my eyes close. He was obviously  _  to have a question to answer. In fact, his answers were always interesting. I continued to do this every day of the course and found myself actually enjoying the subject. The professor seemed to become a bit more  _  and some of the other students even  joined in  from time to time. My little game had saved me from being bored, as it was  _  to do. And, I learned quite a bit about ancient world history. Except for all of his strange  _  , he was indeed quite an expert in his field. On the last day of his class, we gathered our  _  and headed out the door. The shy, red-haired professor  _  directly in front of me, with obvious efforts, as I reached the door, and put out his hand. He said, \"I want to thank you for making this class so interesting.\" As he shook my hand and  _  for the first time, I was so surprised. To me, it had been a pleasant way to  _  the time. I had no idea that all of my question asking had any  _  on him or the others at all. Each of us, through the things we say and do, can have a great effect not just on our own experiences, but those of others.",
