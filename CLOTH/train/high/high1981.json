As I went out of my home to   _   the feast, something felt a bit off. I did not feel right\n  _   alone to go to the feast. Though I had worked many hours to prepare the food, I felt a(n)   _   desire to continue giving. So I decided to make a gift out of some leftover vegetarian curry that I had cooked. I filled a container with the curry and   _   it in a plastic bag with a fork and napkin, creating a packed meal.  \nAs I   _   through my day traveling to and from the festival, I kept a watchful eye out for someone who was sincerely   _  . On my way home, I saw a poorly-dressed man pushing a grocery cart full of possessions. This cart   turned out   to be his only home, and he seemed to badly need any   _   he could get. I told him that I had some vegetarian curry that I was looking to give to someone who really needed it, and I offered it to him. He said yes   _  . After a brief conversation, the homeless man seemed very   _   for what I had done. He thanked me several times.  \nAs I walked away, a stranger in the street said, \"That is so   _   of you!\" This really caught me off   _  \nbecause I was in a very shady part of the city where people generally do not   _   outwardly friendly statements like that. I 27 _  a lightness afterward, as if a mission had been accomplished. I wonder, though, if this really was a   _  , who uploaded the orders into my mind?",
