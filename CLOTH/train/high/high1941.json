I turned around to find a wrinkled, little   _   lady looking up at me with a smile.  \n    She said, \"Hi. My name is Rose. I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug? \" I laughed and   _   responded, \"Of course you may!\" and she gave me a giant squeeze. \"Why are you in college at such a young , innocent 40 _  ? \"I asked.  \"I always   dreamed of   having a college education and now I'm getting   _   !\" she told me.  \n    Later, we became close friends.  Every day we would leave class together and she   _   her wisdom and experience with me.  Over the   _   of the year, Rose became a campus icon and she   _   made friends wherever she went.  \nAt the   _   of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet .  I'll   _   forget what she taught us. When she was introduced, frustrated and a little embarrassed, she cleared her   _   and said, \"We do not stop playing because we are old;  we   _   old because we stop playing. There are only two secrets to staying 50 _ , being happy, and achieving success. You have to   _   and find humor every day.  You've got to have a dream. When you  52 _  your dreams, you die. \" \nOne week after graduation Rose died 53 _  in her sleep. Many college students attended her funeral in tribute to   the wonderful woman who taught   _   example that it's never too   _   to be all you can possibly be.",
