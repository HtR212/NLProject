    "article": "Nine years ago around Christmas, I was on a Captiva Island beach at sunrise. I crouched   low there and was lost in the false hope of finding a treasure larger than the small  _  on the shore.\nA man ran slowly along the waves  _  my direction. When he came near me, he slowed to a walk. I didn't  _  him until he was almost standing over me. Too young to be  _  of strangers, I got on my feet and looked at him. It was then that I saw what was in his  _  , a beautiful bright cream-colored shell, the kind of thing that I was looking for. He smiled as I stared in  _  , and then, to my shock, he handed it to me. I held it  _  before me like a diamond, not  _  my eyes.\n\"I think you will like it,\" he said, and then continued his  _  down the beach.I do not  _  his voice, his clothes or even his face,  _  I do still have the shell, and the greatest lesson I've ever  _  . Now the shell sits on my bedside table, not as  _  as it was, but it is still there, a  _  reminder that there is  _  in the world.\nThat man saved my belief in the kindness of people, and he saved my belief that one can find what means something in life. I see my shell every day, and I know that I can  get through  bad days because there are good things in my life. In the end, all that we have is  _  we have done for others. The shell is  _  to me, as important as another man who returned to the plane to  _  me my lost jacket.\nI know that  _  a difference in someone's life, no matter how big or small, is what truly matters, and that it is worth all the treasure in the world.",
