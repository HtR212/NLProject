Airlines  _  to improve, and they adopted new standards just before Christmas.  _  as another summer nears, plenty of  _  travelers don't see much improvement in customer  _  overall. This month, the Department of Transportation's (DOT) office will publish its first critical  _  on whether airlines are  _  their promises. One survey suggests problems: the number of  _  to the DOT about the top 10 airlines in the first  _  rose 89% from a year ago . Hit last summer by passenger complaints and the threat of consumer-protection laws by the  _  , 14 airlines  _  to adopt a set of basic customer-service standards called Customers First .

Mead warns travelers shouldn't  _  too much. Most of the promises are  aimed at  better communication with customers , not problems with flights . \"Passengers should show more understanding to airlines about their  _  to better air service.\" Spokeswoman Shelly Sassoon says. \"And when  _  are made, it takes a long time for them to be noticed,\" she says. Now, the efforts may be working. During the first quarter, Delta had the second-lowest rate of complaints among the  _  10 carriers.  _  , its rate, along with other carriers', is up from last year. McCain and other lawmakers say there may be a  _  to pass new consumer-protection  _  .",
