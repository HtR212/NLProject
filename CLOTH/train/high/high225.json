Attracted by the great music, many of the passers-by  slowed down  their paces and put some money into his hat.\nThe next day, the artist came again. Different from the day before, he took out a large piece of paper and laid it on the ground. Then he  _  the violin and began playing. On the paper it said, \"Last night a gentleman named George Sang put an important thing into my hat by mistake. Please come to  _  it soon.\"\nIt caused a great excitement among the  _  and people wondered what it could be. After about half an hour, a middle-aged man hurriedly ran there. \"Yes, it's you. You did come here. I knew that you're an honest man and would certainly come here.\"\nThe young violinist asked  _  , \"Are you Mr. George Sang?\" The man nodded. \"Did you lose something?\" \"It's lottery,\" said the man. The violinist took out a lottery ticket on which George Sang's name was seen. \"Is it?\" he asked. George nodded promptly and  _  the lottery ticket and kissed it.\nThe story turned out to be this: George Sang bought a lottery ticket. The awards opened yesterday and he won a  _  of $500,000. He was so happy, but when he took out 50 dollars to put in the hat, the lottery ticket was also thrown in. The violinist was a student at an Art College and has planned to attend  _  studies in Vienna, He has booked the ticket and would fly that morning. However he cancelled the  _  and came back to wait.\nLater someone asked the violinist, \"At that time you were in need to pay the  _  fee and you had to play the violin every day to make the money. Then why didn't you  _  the lottery for yourself?\" The violinist said, \"Although I don't have much money, I live happily; but if I lose honesty I won't be happy forever.\"\nThrough our lives, we can gain a lot and lose so much, but being  _  should always be with us.",
