As he stood there making waffles   for his son, he  _  what would happen if he poured rubber into his waffle iron. Later, he tried it and the  _  looked something like the bottom of most sports shoes we see today. Still, when he took this idea to several existing  _  companies, he was laughed at. In fact, every single company turned him down. Though rather  _  , Bowerman persevered and went on to form his own company, making NIKE  _  shoes.\nSometimes good ideas grow out of  frustration  . When Fred Smith was a student at Yale University, he needed to have some paperwork  _  across the country the next day. Smith was amazed to find out that overnight delivery was  _  . He sat for a long while wondering why. Why couldn't there be a possible overnight mail delivery service? He  decided to  design one. Smith did just that and turned his design into a class project. His business  _  gave him only a C for his efforts.  _  , Smith was not through. He  _  the ideas in that class project and  _  turned them into one of the first and most  _  overnight mail services in the world--FedEx.\nWe know today, of course, that each of these ideas  led to  an incredibly successful product or service which has  _  the way many of us live. The  _  questions are usually open-ended and are often silly.  _  aren't afraid to ask such questions, but adults  _  are. Think how different the world might be  _  people never asked \"silly\" question!",
