    "article": "She was only about five feet tall and probably never weighed more than 110 pounds. However, Miss Bessie was a(n)   _  presence in the classroom. From 1938 to 1942,when I attended Saint Bernard's High School, she taught me a lot   more than   I realized.\nThere was never a(n)   _   problem in Miss Bessie's classes. We didn't dare to trouble a woman who knew about the Battle of Hastings and could also play the piano and   make sense of   Shakespeare and Milton.\nMiss Bessie knew that my family couldn't afford to buy a newspaper. She knew we didn't   _   own a radio. Still, she   _   me to look out for my   _   and find some ways to   keep up with   what's going on in the world.   _   I became a delivery boy who delivered newspapers. I   _   made a dollar a week, but I got to read a newspaper every day.\nMiss Bessie noticed things that had nothing to do with schoolwork but were vital to a youngster's   _  . Once a few classmates made fun of my   _   overcoat. As I was leaving school, Miss Bessie   _   me on the back of that old overcoat and said, \"Carl, never worry about what you don't have. Just make the most of what you do have -- a(n)   _  \".\nAmong the things that I didn't have was  _   in the little wooden house. But because of her   _  , I spent many hours beside a kerosene lamp   reading Shakespeare's works. Miss Bessie introduced me   _   a wonderful world of poems and stories. She led me to   _   that I could write poems as well as Shakespeare.\nSo I read   _   Miss Bessie told me to, and tried to remember the things she insisted that I store. Years later, her encouragement finally led to that lovely day when Miss Bessie dropped me a note   _   \"I'm so proud to read your article in The Times.\"",
