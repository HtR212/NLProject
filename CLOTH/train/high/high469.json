    "article": "I was tired and hungry after a long day of work. When I walked into the living-room, my 12-year-old son looked up at me and said, \"I  _  you.\" I did not  _  what to say, and I just stood there, looking  _  at him. My first  _  was that he  _  need help with his homework. Then I asked, \"What was that all  _  ?\" \"Nothing,\" he said, \"My teacher said we should tell our parents we love them and  _  what they say.\" The next day I called his teacher to  find out  more about what my son said and how the other parents had reacted( ). \"Most of the fathers had the  _  response as you did,\" the teacher said, \"When I first  _  that we try this, I asked the children  _  they thought their parents  _  say. Some of them thought their parents would have heart trouble.\" Then the teacher  _  , \" I want my students to know that feeling love is an important part of  _  . I'm trying to tell them it's too bad that we don't express our feelings. A boy  _  tell his father or mother he loves him.\" The teacher understands that sometimes it is  _  for some of us to say something that is good for us to say. That evening when my son  _  to me, I took him in my arms and held on for an  _  moment, saying, \"Hey, I love you,  _  .\" I don't know if saying that made  _  of us healthier, but it did feel pretty good.",
