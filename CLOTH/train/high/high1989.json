My daughter  _  with her, and they're good friends. When we saw the little girl  _  , I asked my daughter if she wanted to go and  _  with her. She said, \"Yes, I don't want her to be  _  .\" And then she took her breakfast to sit beside her friend. I watched her  _  her food with the little girl and talk to her.\nWalking back to my car I was very  _  to know that my little girl had a kind  _  . When I got home last night, I asked her  _  her day had been. She said that her  _  wasn't sad any more. She was proud to have shared    her  _  with her and played with her  all day  . I praised my daughter for  _  such a caring friend and  _  her that I was very proud of her. She  _  , and told me that she didn't like to see people being sad.\nI hugged her and told her what a/an  _  girl she was.  _  , she said, \"I'm Daddy's little girl\". I couldn't help but smile, and was proud to be her dad. My little girl has  _  me a lot. Because of her I do my best to make people who  _  be sad smile.",
