Africa  _  a world completely different to that of Europe,  _  a warmer, more fragrant and more colorful one! Products are cheap but the  _  is not.\nI had the good  _  to spend five days there during my holidays. We stayed in a beautiful hotel which  _  five euros a night with free breakfast. As is traditional in Morocco, we were  _  with many cups of mint  tea as well. There you could do cookery classes,  _  on the roof, and eat a delicious tagine.\nDuring our stay here we decided to be  _  nd visit the Sahara. It may have been nine hours'  _  but it was definitely worth the long mini bus ride! We zoomed through the mountains and round the big corners. After nine hours we  _  at the mouth of the Sahara. We  _  a camel ride to where we had our camp. This was  _  by a rich meal and a heart--warming bonfire with music. It was a wonderful way to have some insight into life in the desert and how the people there  _  .\nHowever, it was a bit  _  to see these nomads  with mobile phones and using them in the Sahara desert! It's funny how the whole world has become  _  oriented ! We saw shooting stars and the nomads  _  under the stars in the desert  even if  it is very, very cold at night! However our  _  were very big and quite luxurious with mattresses inside and rugs  laid down everywhere.\nThis was probably the best  _  of my life and I would  _  anyone else to take on this adventure!",
