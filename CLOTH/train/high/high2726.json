His parents acknowledged his39 _ difficulties,but always tried to help him see his strengths so that he could walk with   _  .\n        Shortly after Jim finished high school, he was  _  in a motorcycle\naccident. After his death, his mother submitted this letter to the Palo Alto\nTimes:\n  Today we buried our 20-year-old son. He was killed instantly in a motorcycle accident   _  Friday night. How I wish I had known  _  I\ntalked to him last that it would be the last time. If I had only known I would\nhave  _  , \"Jim, I love you and I'm so very proud\nof you.\"\n  I would have taken the time to   _  the many blessings he\nbrought to the lives of the many who loved him. I would have taken time to\nappreciate his beautiful  _  , the sound of his\nlaughter, his genuine love of people.\n  I won't get another  _  to tell my son all I would have wanted him to\nhear, but, other  _  , you do have a chance. Tell your\nyoung people  _  you would want them to hear if\nyou knew it would be your last  _  . The last time I\ntalked to Jim was the day he died. He called me to say, \"Hi, Mom! I just\ncalled to say I  _  you. Got to go to work.\nBye.\" He gave me something to  _  forever.\n  If there is any purpose at all to Jim's death, maybe it is to make others   _  more of life and to have people,  _  families,\ntake the time to let each other know just how much we care.\n  You may  _  have another chance. Do it today!",
