    "article": "My husband Jeff and I moved into our new home in Scottsbluff last year just before Christmas. I did not have the  _  or energy to carry out my traditional Christmas decorating and baking activities. What was the point, anyway? It was going to be a  _  Christmas after all.  _  , the neighborly nature of west Nebraska residents started to trickle in. There was a  _  on the door one evening. It was Jeff's new colleague, John Smith, and his wife, Phyllis. The Smiths had stopped by to  _  us to town with a loaf of homemade bread. They pointed out a  _  on the porch . Apparently the doorbell wasn't working in the cold snowy weather and we had  _  a visit from the Browns, our across-the-street neighbors, who brought us a Christmas card and more Christmas cookies. The  _  feelings brought by these thoughtful gestures lasted longer than the food. As Jeff and I were clearing pre-Christmas  _  from our driveway, Ernie Guzman came over from next door to  _  us to dig out. Then, we received an invitation to  _  a Christmas Eve meal with our neighbors, Ernie and Nancy Sommer, and their  _  --a 90-year-old lady, who also had no family in the immediate area with whom to spend the holiday. Our Christmas Eve was quite merry, thanks to our  _  . Our Christmas morning  _  was special, thanks to the Smiths' gift of bread. I was so  _  for these gestures of welcome, especially during the holidays. This year, we were again unable to be with our families for Christmas. The  _  and work schedules just made things too difficult.  _  that sense of Christmas isolation all too well, we decided to try to round up some other folks who were  _  in the holidays. Lonely people are all around us, but most of us  _  notice them. Just take a look around you. Sometimes, the smallest  _  gesture can make a world of difference.",
