    "article": "My watch broke a few days ago, which made me sad. The watchband   broke without my noticing, causing it to fall to the floor while I was doing some   _  . As I stepped back to   _   some other clothes, I heard a terrible sound. I   picked up   the watch and saw a spider web of cracks on its face. I saw that it was beyond   _   and sadly threw it into the garbage.\nStrangely, now that it is   _   I find that I have no wish to buy a new one.   _   it is because in this digital age clocks are   _  . They are on my wall, in my car, on my computer, and even on my phone. I can't even   _   my head without seeing what time it is.\nI think that the real reason,   _  , is that as I have grown older, my   _   with time itself has changed. While I feel as   _   as ever, time in this world has gone by much too fast. The little baby boy I once   _   to sleep on my chest is now a 23yearold man who is bigger than me. Young and   _   adults from my childhood have grown old, sickened and even   passed away  . I can now see that time can't be kept. It flows on and on and carries us with it on a river of   _  . The days zoom by  , our hair turns   _  , our skin becomes wrinkled, and our bodies wear out. Looking at our   _   cannot slow it down. All we can do is embrace it and   _   each day we are given.\nSo do your best to spend each   _   moment here in joy. Do your best to spend your days living, laughing, hugging, helping, praying, and smiling. Most   _  , do your best to spend your seconds here loving yourself, and others.",
