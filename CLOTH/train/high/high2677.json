    "article": "Less is more. This is why we say: reduce things by half instead of doubling them, get rid of junk instead of piling it up, slow down instead of  speeding up  . Apply these  _  in your everyday life, and you will find yourself being on your journey to simplification. When you concentrate on one task, you find you have  _  that you didn't even know you had. Just imagine: you are at a fair and you have to carry two heavy pigs over 100 yards. If you keep  _  one and then the other, it will take a long time, because one of them will keep slipping out of your hand and  running off  . But if you tie one pig in a place, pick up the other, gather all your  _  , make a dash for the finish line, pause for a moment, run back, get the other one, and with great determination, carry the second pig to the finish line, and then you can be sure of success. The stress of work is now great almost in all occupations. In the modern nuclear family, the stress that  _  would have been shared among all the relatives is now  _  on the individual partner. If you have the feeling that 24 hours per day is not  _  , then it's not because the day has too few hours, but because you have too many activities. A simple fact is that  _  people tend to forget. The  _  is equally simple: refuse to accept so many assignments. \"I can handle stress\" is regarded as a positive statement. People who can handle stress are given more --- until one day they  break down  . Pay careful attention to the  _  that tell you that you are under more stress than you can deal with. These signs come from various  _  of life. You become ill, or your work efficiency  _  . If you have any of these symptoms, change your life goals and decrease your tolerance of stress. Say openly, \"I can't manage that.\"",
