Then, he had no idea what things cost, and wouldn't  _  to take care of what he had. Nor did he realise how difficult it was for other children to get toys like the ones he had. A time came, though, when he was  _  used to all his toys and various stuff that he began to want something  _  . One of his uncles found a fine horse and he gave it to Charlie. Charlie was very  _  at having a horse. He had never got something like that before. However, he  _  the horse just as badly as he did all his other toys, and it soon started looking  _  . For the first time in his life Charlie became truly  _  . He loved the horse, and the fact that his family had offered to exchange it for a new one meant nothing to him. One day, while in the countryside, he saw a girl with a horse. The girl looked very poor, but the horse seemed happy and looked great. Wondering how she had  _  this, Charlie secretly followed her, watching everything she did. First he followed them through the forest, where he saw that she never used the whip, and never  _  the horse. Then they came to the stable, and  soon after  they arrived the girl fed and watered the horse. Then she carefully groomed it. Charlie was surprised. This was the  _  of what Charlie had done to his horse. Charlie wanted to  _  and become like the girl. As no one had shown him how to do this, he  went over  to her and asked her to teach him how to look after his horse. After her initial surprise, she happily  _  . With her he learned how to  _  care and effort into things. He learned that he could be much  _  with only a few special things that you truly  cared for  , than with thousands of toys that were only good for a short time and were then  _  aside. When the horse finally  _  all its strength and health, Charlie was happy that his effort had been worthwhile.",
