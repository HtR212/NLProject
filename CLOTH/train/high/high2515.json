So he sent them each on a quest  ,  in turn  , to go and look at a pear tree that was a great distance away. The first son went in winter, the second in spring, the third in summer, and the youngest son in fall.\nWhen they had all gone and come back, he called them together to  _  what they had seen. The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and  _  . The second son contradicted--it was covered with green buds and full of  _  . The third son  _  , saying it was laden with blossoms that smelled so sweet and looked so beautiful. It was the most graceful thing he had  _  seen. The last son disagreed with all of them; he said it was ripe and  _  with fruit, full of life and fulfillment.\nThe man then  _  to his sons that they were all right, because they had each seen but one season in the tree's life. He told them that you cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one season, and that the essence of who they are--the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life--can only be  _  at the end, when all the seasons are up.\nIf you give up when it's winter, you will  _  the hope of your spring, the beauty of your summer, fulfillment of your fall. Don't let the  _  of one season destroy the joy of all the rest. Don't judge a life by one  _  season.",
