About thirty metres away, a boat pulled alongside the slippery steps leading 36  _  to the sea. \"Hey, look!\" exclaimed Rahim. \"Those two men are 37  _  heavy rocks. I thought we no longer do muscle labour in this technological 38  _  . \" \"You don't 39  _  a crane to unload less than a dozen rocks, do you?\" smiled Joshua. \"But those men don't 40  _  to have muscles at all,\" said Michael, rather surprised. Joshua smiled. \"They are 41  _  laborers who know how to spread the weight of the rocks they 42  _  . See how the man positions the rock just at the slope of his  _  . Some of the rock's weight is set 44  _  his head, some on the right hand and some on the left hand. His body isn't bent. His legs are well 45  _  .\" \"You're right, Josh. He may have a small build. 46  _  he certainly well knows his job. Dear me! And to think we have been studying 47  _  ! \" Rahim thought about all that was happening. Suddenly, he said, \"Technology won't 48  _  the human being completely, it appears.\" \"I don't think it will. \" 49  _  Joshua. \"You can harvest a crop of potatoes or wheat with one of those large, multi-purpose tractors, but you 50  _  use that equipment to harvest tea leaves and tomatoes, will you?\" \"You can get a computer to 51  print out  multiple-choice assessments, but you cannot get the computer to produce of assess essays, can you?\" asked Michael. \"Well, the washing machine leaves my shirt collar quite as 52  _  as ever --- that's domestic technology for you! \" said Rahim. \"One day, perhaps, there won't be anybody 53  _  who can carry a large rock the way those men do. It's not going to be a very 54  _  world, I'm afraid.\" Sighed Michael. \"You're too much of a pessimist ,Mike.\" Said Joshua. \" 55  _  will always be other things that will make the world exciting. \"",
