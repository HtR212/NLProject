The teenager was in the   _   for less than three hours.\nIt was Carol's fiftieth birthday, and Jim had two plane tickets to Hawaii in his pocket. He was going to   _   her. However, he was killed by a drunken driver.\n\"How have you   _   this?\" I asked Carol, a year later.\n  _  welled up  in her eyes. I thought I had said the   _   thing, but she said, \"It's all right. I want to  _   you. The day I married Jim, I promised I would never let him leave the house in the morning   _   telling him I loved him. He made the same   _  . It got to be a joke between us, and as we grew older it got to be a(n)    _   promise to keep.\n\"I remember running down the driveway, saying 'I love you' just before he drove out of my   _  , or driving all the way to his office just to put a(n)  _  saying 'I love you' on his car. It was a funny  _  .\n\"We made a lot of   _   trying to say 'I love you' before noon every day of our married life.\n\"The morning Jim  _   , he left a birthday card in the kitchen and then left   _  . I heard the engine starting. Oh, no, I thought. I   _   out quickly and knocked on the car window   _   he rolled it down.\n\"Here on my fiftieth birthday I, Carol Garret, want you, Mr James E. Garret to    _   that 'I love you!'\n\"That's how I've survived, knowing that the last words I said to Jim were, 'I love you!'\"",
