We caught up with it is the  _  that the driver would notice the sign.\nAfter a brief expression of  _  on his face,he seemed to have noticed the sign and  _  down to pull over.We pulled over right behind him.\nWhen he knows that we don't have enough gas,he  _  o buy us gas at the next town Roswell.When we  _  our difficulty of not having enough gas to get there,he said they had a gas  _  on his farm about 10 minutes away,so if we could give him 20 minutes,he would  _  back there,get a can of gasoline and  _  up our tank.\nWe could not believe our good  _  !We were filled with gratitude for the  _  of strangers such as this person as we waited for him to return.Sure enough,he was back with the can.He  _  to take payment for the gas,saying\"What good is a man who cannot help another  in need  .\"",
