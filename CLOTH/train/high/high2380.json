The store was my first     _  that morning, and I had a half dozen others on my     _   before meeting my husband for lunch.\nTwo minutes turned into ten, and I watched as the other lines moved    _   . I moved my     _    0n the cart and dug for my wallet, trying to   _    . the cashier that it was time to get a move-on.  Finally, after fifteen minutes, I took a breath and     _  . Then I heard the cashier tell the women in front of me :  \"And just like that,  he told me what she looked like and l   _  one hundred dollars here to   pay for   her groceries.  He said not to worry about the      _     , just give it to charity. \"\nThe story she was    _    had taken place in the produce department. An older man had witnessed a(n)     _    mama in need.    _     for foods with kids around, she was sticking to her list and     _    the items on her calculator as she went. The gentleman said he had a little    _   0n him that day, so he left one hundred dollars to    _   her groceries and, just maybe, add a little wiggle room  to her     _   .\nAfter hearing about the man who had .    _    served a fellow traveler in life,  I realized that my hurry,    _     and general worries were     _    . What's five extra. minutes in a line to hear a story of a man sharing his     love   ? Suddenly, I know I could 'wait.",
