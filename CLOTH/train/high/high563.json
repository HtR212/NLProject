    "article": "A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had loved a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom, and knowing his father could well  _  it, he told him that was all he wanted. As  graduation day  drew near, the young man expected  _  that his father had bought the car. Finally, on the morning of the special day, his father called him into his study. His father told him how  _  he was to have such a fine son, and how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautiful wrapped gift box. Curious, but a little bit  _  , the young man opened the box and found a lovely Bible . Angrily, he raised his  _  to his father and said, \"Is a Bible  all  you can give me with all your money?\" He then stormed out of the house, leaving the Bible. Many years  _  and the young man was very successful in business, but  _  his father was very old, he thought perhaps he  _  go to see him. He had not seen him since that graduation day.  _  he could make the arrangements , he received a telegram which  _  him of his father's death, and all the possessions willed to him.  _  arriving at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to  _  through his father's important papers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had  _  it years ago. With tears, he opened the Bible and began to  turn over  . As he was reading, a car  _  dropped from the back of the Bible. How many times do we  _  blessings because they are not wrapped as we expected? Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember what you now have was once  _  the things you hoped for. What may appear as bad fortune may  _  be the door that is just waiting to be opened.",
