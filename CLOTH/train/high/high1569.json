    "article": "I have a cousin who's a farmer. If you saw him on market day with his old boots and worn hat, you might think he was a tramp . But he's either buying or selling  _  for thousands of pounds. He doesn't have a luxurious lifestyle, but the farmhouse, dozens of acres of land, machinery, cattle, chicken and crops must be worth a fortune. You might describe him as a  _  man, but he doesn't look like that. My father owned a shop selling newspapers, cigarettes, birthday cards, toys, books and magazines. The shop  _  a comfortable life for us, but we weren't rich. The only luxury was that my father owned a car when most people in our town couldn't afford one,  apart from  professionals such as doctors and lawyers. My point is that  _  can be misleading. You often can't  _  the rich from the way they look. I once met Richard Branson, the Virgin Airlines tycoon .He'd  _  a hot balloon across the Atlantic and landed in the Irish sea. When he was rescued, he was wearing jeans, a T-shirt and a sneaker. You'd  _  have guessed he was a multimillionaire. Andrew Bruce, the 11th Earl of Elgin,  _  a group of press people to his luxurious home in Fife, Scotland. His  _  , the 7th Earl of Elgin was famous for removing and transporting to Britain priceless sculptures from the Parthenon, a very famous temple in Greece. The so-called Elgin Marbles can be seen in the British Museum. The Earl's castle was  _  cold, despite a fire burning in the hearth . He explained to us,\"I'm sorry it's so cold, but you should know that a gentleman's house is always cold.\" There you have it:  _  doesn't always bring comfort.",
