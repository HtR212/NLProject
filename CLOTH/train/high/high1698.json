    "article": "The first day of school we were surprised to know a new classmate. I  _  around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I found a little  _  lady with a warm smile.\nShe said, \"Hi! I'm 87 years old. Can I give you a hug? \" I laughed and heartily  _  , \"Of course!\"\n\"Why are you in college at such a young, innocent  age?\" I asked.\nShe replied, \"I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married,  have  children, and then travel around.\"\n\"  _  ?\"I asked. I  _  why she gave herself so much trouble at this age.\n\"I always  dreamed of  having a college education and now I'm getting one!\" she told me. We became friends quickly..\n  Over the year  , Rose became an icon  in the school and she easily made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she enjoyed the  _  which was paid to her from the other students.\nAt the end of the term we invited Rose to speak at our football party. I'll never forget what she  _  us.\n\"We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old  _  we stop playing. Here are the secrets to staying  _  . You have to laugh and find  _  every day. You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die.  _  we have many people like this walking around!\" she said.\n\"There is a huge  _  between growing older and growing up. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't  _  any gift or ability ,\" she added. \"But growing up needs  _  the chance in change. Have no regrets. The old usually don't regret  _  they did, but rather things they did not do.\"\nOne weak after graduation that year,Rose died in peace in her sleep.She taught us  by example  that it's never too  _  to be all you can possibly be.",
