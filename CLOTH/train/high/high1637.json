But the school district was playing hardball with them with no   _  for them.They had gone to the library to   _    how to replace this paperwork,but they found they could not   _  the fees to replace the items quickly.\nBecause of my background as a(n)   _  administrator and my computer skills,I was able to research for them online how to   _  the needed documents at low cost with only a slight delay.I was able to speak with them   _  and positively about the process and explain that waiting the few   _   days would make very little 55 _  in getting their little guy enrolled and attending school again.They told me they   _   my taking the time to sit down with them and help thern see the\"forest for the trees\",for they had felt   _  with what initially had seemed the impossibility of their situation.\nTaking the time to   _  my skills and \"be present'' with them had truly helped them regain some of the   _   they had come to our city with when they moved--60 looking for  a better 1ife.",
