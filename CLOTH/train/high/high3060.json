She  _  a minute later, and brought some paper and pens. \"Do me a  _  ,\" Professor Smith asked. \"We're going to try something and I  _  your cooperation. On the small piece of paper please  write down  the 3 biggest problems you are facing in your personal life right now. Don't write your name on it. We'll keep it  _  .\" The group found the experiment  _  , not knowing what was to follow. After everyone wrote down their problems, Professor Smith asked everyone to  _  their paper and put it in a small basket that was in the front of the room. There were  _  expressions throughout the room,  _  again, everyone cooperated, wanting to know what would  _  next. Professor Smith shook the basket and then he  _  around the room and asked each person to  _  a paper from the basket. After he had done that, he sat back down and looked around the room. \"Friends,  _  the paper and read to yourself the problems that you  _  ,\" Professor Smith said. Then, Professor Smith  _  at the woman sitting on his left and asked, \"Lisa, would you like to  _  your problems that you wrote down with those that you chose from the basket?\" \"No,\" Lisa said. Next, Professor Smith asked the man sitting next to Lisa the  _  question. \"Would you like to exchange the problems you wrote down with those that you chose from the basket?\"  _  the reply was \"No.\" Professor Smith went around the whole room. Everyone had a  _  to answer. Surprisingly, the answers were all the same -- no, no, no, no.... Some people said that \"I can settle my own problems, but I can't  deal with  what I chose out of the basket\". Some people said \"Wow -- these make my problems look like nothing.\"",
