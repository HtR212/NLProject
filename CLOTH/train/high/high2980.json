After several months of  _  , I was ready to spend the second term of my first year of high school as an exchange student in Australia. Landing in Perth was one of the most exciting moments of my life. I  _  then that there was no turning back. The family I would live with was waiting for me, and it would be only five days  _  the new school year started. The Catholic school I  _  was different from my public school back in the States. The uniform code was very strict. We were only  _  to wear one bracelet, which had to be a watch and one necklace, which had to have a Holy Cross. I was quite intimidated at first,  _  never having been to a new school--even in the United States. Everything went  _  , though. The teachers were welcoming and the students were friendly. The most unforgettable time of my term abroad was with forty-one other international exchange students traveling around Australia during our term break. Our  _  were as extensive as our nationalities: we traveled to Sydney, Canberra, Mildura, Coober Pedy, Uluru, Kings Canyon, Alice Springs, Mount Isa, Airlie Beach, and the Cold Coast. The few weeks we enjoyed together were crowded with  _  . We took a day-cruise on Darling Harbor and visited the Sydney Opera House. We slept in an \"underground town\". We walked around the famous Ayers Rock and went sailing on the Pacific Ocean. At the end of our  _  in Australia, we had three weeks of traveling time to share our stories and help each other deal with leaving. It was  _  that our last day together was filled with tears. We packed our camp, exchanged e-mail addresses, and gathered together for a final good-bye.",
