I hate him.\" The people with marked faces from the  _  of the bomb made me cry, \"I hate him.\" I saw people suffering a terrible,  _  death. Again and again I cried as I saw these people, \"I hate him!\" Some time later, that man appeared in a meeting I  _  . As I looked at him, I  _  him very much. Then I listened to what he told us of his  _  the day when he dropped the bomb on our city. I heard him say, \"When I flew over the city  _  we dropped the bomb, I cried, 'Oh, God , what have I  _  '.\" I could see that he found it  _  to speak of that day. As this happened I suddenly  _  my hatred of him was  _  . It only made me unhappy also. As I did this, it was as if a heavy load  fell off  my shoulders. Then I decided to  _  him.
