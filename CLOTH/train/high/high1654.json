Everything they know about you   _  through this device, sometimes from hundreds of miles away.   _  they feel they can know you   _  from the sound of your voice. That's how powerful the   _  is.\nPowerful, yes, but not always   _  . For years I dealt with my travel agent only by phone. Rani, my faceless agent whom I'd never met   in person  , got me rock-bottom prices on airfares, cars, and hotels. But her cold voice really    _  me. I sometimes wished to  _  another agent.\nOne morning, I had to   _  an immediate flight home for a family emergency. I ran into Rani's office   for the first time  . The woman sitting at the desk,   _  my madness, sympathetically jumped up. She gave me a   _  smile, nodded while listening patiently, and then printed out the   _  immediately. \"What a wonderful lady!\" I thought.\nRushing out   _  I called out over my shoulder, \"By the way, what's your name?\" \"I'm Rani,\" she said. I turned around and saw a   _  woman with a big smile on her face waving to wish me a safe trip. I was   _  ! Why had I thought she was cold? Rani was, well, so  _  .\nSitting back in the car on the way to the airport, I figured it all out. Rani's   _  ---her warm smile, her nods, her 'I'm here for you'   _  ---were all silent signals that didn't travel through wires.",
