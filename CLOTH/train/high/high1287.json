    "article": "It happened last winter, at the end of a difficult year for my family. My brother died suddenly in the spring in 2013.\nBy Christmas, my family was still   _  with the impossibility of \"moving on.\" Thinking of the holidays  _   us of the previous holiday season before Ben died. Attempting a \"  _  \" Christmas in Vancouver seemed impossible, we decided to  _   to California for our first Christmas without Ben. My parents and sister would drive there, and I would   _  from Ottawa to meet them.\nActually, I found it difficult to ignore my feelings of  _   and find any Christmas spirit. I just wanted to stay in Ottawa and avoid pretending the holidays were possible when my family was   _  .When I unwillingly began to pack, I couldn't find my passport.\nI searched a file of other   _   papers, my tiny apartment, and I checked everywhere -Nothing.\nFrustrated, I curled up in bed,   _   everything I'd said about wanting to stay in Ottawa . \"My family really needed this vacation and I've spoiled it,\" I said to my friends.\nCalling the airline. I was warned waiting time for customers were \"Over. Three. Hours.\" While waiting, I searched the  _   again, no luck.\nI checked Air Canada's website aimlessly when a weather report caught my eye: A Storm Hit Toronto . My heartbeat quickened. I was   _  to fly through Toronto that afternoon.\nFor the first time, I hoped for a storm big enough to   _   my travel plans and buy me enough time to get an emergency passport. After four hours on hold, my  _   was granted. An agent promptly informed me the weather wasn't promising and  _   me to a Christmas Eve flight.\nHours later I landed and hugged my sister tightly. I felt   _   for friends who supported me through hard times; for my loving and strong family.",
