When Mrs.Thompson 2  _   that they marry and live with her until they could get a 3   _   of their own, Annie hesitated. Her idea of 4  _   had been something which 5   _  her a husband and an orderly, well-furnished home all at once. 6  _   she soon saw the 7  _    of this arrangement. She would, first of all, 8  _   from her present life into a house which was quiet and well run, not 9  _   her own; and she would be able to go on walking so that she and Bob could 10  _   up all the more quickly for their own house. She would also get Bob, a good enough husband for any working-class 11  _  :good-natured and 12  _   to be bent her way whenever it was 13   _  for her ends.\nThings went well until her mother-in-law's 14  _  , when Annie had to give up her 15  _   and was at home all day. Her father-in-law became just a 16  _   figure in the house and 17  _  Bob became used to him, Annie began to find the old man's constant 18  _  in the house a source of growing annoyance .\n\"He gets on my nerves, Bob,\" she said. \"And he hardly says a word all day.\"\n\"Well, I suppose he has a 19  _   to do as he likes,\" Bob said mildly. \"It's his house not ours.\" But to Annie, now looking after the house 20  as if   it were her own, it was beginning to seem the other way about.",
