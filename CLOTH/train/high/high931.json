They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of  _  would be considered a very poor family. On their  _  from their trip, the father asked his son, \" How was the trip?\" \"It was  _  , Dad .\" \"Did you see how poor people can be?\" the father asked. \"Oh yeah?\" said the son. \"So what did you  _  from the trip?\" asked the father. The son answered, \"I saw that we have one dog and they have four. We have a pool that  _  to the middle of our garden and they have a creek that has  _  end. We have lanterns in our garden and they have the  _  at night. We have a  _  piece of land to live on and they have fields that go  _  our sight. We have servants who serve us, but they serve  _  . We buy our food, but they grow theirs. We have  _  around our property to protect us but they have friends to protect them.\" With this the boy's father was  _  . Then his son  _  , \"Dad, thank you for showing me how  _  we are.\" Too many times we  _  what we have and concentrate on what we don't have. What is one person's  _  object is another's prize possession. It's all  _  on one's perspective . Think about what would happen if we all gave  _  for what we have,  instead of  worrying about what we don't have.

Be sure to take the time to express your appreciation and gratitude for the people whom you are close to.",
