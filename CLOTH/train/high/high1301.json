    "article": "People always say that the earlier one learns a language, the  easier  it is to do so, in theory it is that,  _  , in my opinion, that refers to spoken language. Capability to practice some essential  _  of a language and read between the lines can only be trained through proper reading ways and hard work  _  .So spending money to help  _  learn English may  _  up with disappointment. It is likely that the more you  _  ,the more you are let down. The daughter of one of my friends  _  English in primary school,  because of  her foreign teacher's blindness  _  psychology. She did not want to go on  learning  English until middle school,  _  a college student studying English slowly  _  her interest in the language. It is better to have the child learn Chinese than to have some difficulty  _  learning English for several years. Having been engaged in English education,  _  find that despite their excellent  _  , many students have  _  command of English words and phrases. So I suggest that children  _  classical Chinese prose ,rather than  _  them to learn English hurriedly.
