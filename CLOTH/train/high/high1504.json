It's only 50 cents a cup.\" Of course, I couldn't resist it, and felt   _   that kids this young had such a(an) 44 _  in improving their community. It seems that this group of kids, who were having great fun pouring hot chocolate and feeling   _   that they were helping a local cause , already grasped a fundamental idea about   _   out to help others: It feels great! No matter your age or the size of your gesture, whether it is giving out drinks, baking cookies,   _   toys to underprivileged   kids,48 _  a pet from a shelter, or giving clothing to homeless people, giving does a heart good.\nThis valuable   _   usually shines brightest around the holidays--a time when we pause to \n  _   on our good fortune and on those not so   _   . But it's really an important year-round lesson, and not just because being charitable   is the   _   thing to do. Giving to others helps lessen two major   _   on today's families.\nThe onslaught   of materialism with its   _   on self-centeredness. From a constant onslaught of   _   --on TV, in the movies, and on computer screens--we are    _   to \"need\" the next cool gadget , pair of sports shoes, or toys. Our children are particularly   _   influenced by advertisers who focus on their desire to fit in, which in turn can lead to a \"give me' mindset  early.\nThe over-exposure to bad news, which causes   _   .In the past few years, terrifying images of violence and chaos have been difficult to   _  . These tragic events upset our children and can leave them feeling powerless and sad.\nWe can't completely shelter our children from these   _  . But we can combat their influence by teaching our children to give their time and talents to help others--an act that changes the way of the world.",
