    "article": "My mother was a responsible teacher and she retired. So I decided to give her one of my old computers to help her pass the time. She had a little bit of computer   _  , so I just set it up for her and let her   _   with it on her own.\nAs time went on, I   _  the computer was hardly touched. She said she didn't know  _  to use it. I decided to teach her. I sat and   _   everything and she seemed OK with what I said. Unfortunately, my sister called me at that moment   _  we talked on the phone for an hour. Then when I saw her again, she was sitting in front of the computer, looking quite  _   . The screen saver   had appeared and she didn't know how to   _   it off. She had tried \n   _   every key and it didn't work. I told her, \"Just  _   the mouse a little.\" What I meant was that she just needed to move the mouse around to   _   the computer up. What she did was to   pick up  the mouse and start shaking it around in mid-air until the  _   went completely black. I couldn't help laughing because of her funny   _   . The more I laughed the   _  she got.\nShe thought that I was a (n)   _   teacher and she decided to figure the thing out herself. Well, at least I helped her overcome her  _  of breaking something and encouraged her to   _  a little.\nAbout a week later, I found a home-made  _   card with a mouse on the front making a funny face   _   to my door. It said, \"Thanks for the computer lessons. Love, Mom.\"",
