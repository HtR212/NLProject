    "article": "William Wordsworth wrote that \"the human mind is capable of excitement without the application of violent stimulants \". And it appears that simply reading those words proves his   _   .\nResearchers at the University of Liverpool found the works of Shakespeare and Wordsworth and   the like   had a beneficial effect on the mind. It can   _   the reader's attention and trigger  moments of self-reflection.\nUsing scanners, they   _   the brain activity of volunteers as they read pieces of classical English literature both in their   _   form and in a modern translation.\nAnd, according to the Sunday Telegraph, the experiment showed the more   _   prose  and poetry   set off  far more electrical activity in the brain than the easier versions.\nThe research also found poetry,   in particular  , increased activity in the right part of the brain, an area   _   with \"autobiographical  memory\", which helped the reader to   _   on their own experiences. The researchers said this meant the    _    were more useful than self-help books.\nThe brain   _   of 30 volunteers were watched in the first part of the research as they read Shakespeare in different   _  .\nIn one example, volunteers read a line from King Lear, \"A father and a gracious aged man: him have you madded\", before reading the   _   version: \"A father and a gracious aged man: him you have annoyed\". Shakespeare's use of \"mad\" as a(n)   _  caused a higher level of brain activity than the straightforward prose.\nThe next stage of the research was looking at the   _   to which poetry could affect    _    and provide therapeutic  benefit. Volunteers' brains were scanned while reading four lines by Wordsworth, and four \"translated\" lines were also provided.\nThe first version caused more brain activity,    waking up   not only the left part of the brain connected with language, but also the right part that relates to autobiographical memory and emotion.\n\"Poetry is not just a   _   of style. It is also about deep versions of experience that    _   the emotional to the cognitive ,\" said Prof Davis, who will present the findings at the North of England education conference in Sheffield this week.",
