    "article": "Debbie Macomber decided to pursue her dream of becoming a writer. She rented a typewriter, put it on the  _  table and began typing each morning after the kids went to school.  _  the kids came home, she moved it and made them dinner. When they were  _  she got it back and typed some more. Debbie followed this  _  for two years. She had become a struggling writer and she loved every minute of it. One night,  _  , her husband, Wayne, said, \"Honey, I'm sorry, but you're not  bringing in  any income. We can't do this anymore. We can't survive on just what I make.\" That night, her heart was  _  . Debbie knew, with all of the  _  of keeping up a house, working 40 hours a week would  _  her no time to write. Seeing her  _  , her husband asked, \"What's wrong?\" \"I really think I can make it as a  _  .\" \"All right, honey, go for it,\" Wayne  _  for a long time and then said. So Debbie returned to her  _  and her typewriter on the kitchen table, writing for another two years. Wayne worked harder and their kids went without vacations and wore hand-me-downs. But the sacrifice finally  paid off  . Debbie sold her first book after five years of  _  . Then another. And another. Until today, Debbie has  _  more than 100 books, many of  _  have become New York Times best-sellers. Over 60 million copies of her books are in print. And Wayne? His selfless  _  of his wife paid off. He got to retire at 50 and now spends his free time building a private airplane in the basement of their 7,000 square-foot mansion.  _  , Debbie's kids also got a gift more important than several summer camps. As adults, they  _  what Debbie gave them was far more important -- persistence and encouragement to pursue their own dreams.",
