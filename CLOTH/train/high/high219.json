Her room nicely accommodates not only her clothes and bric-a-brac , but her  _  as well. I begin to accept that her room at home is no longer hers. It is now ours, our room for her when she  _  . I  _  myself thinking of when I held her in the cradle of my arm, in the chair alongside my wife's hospital bed. One day old. So  _  , so beautiful, so perfect, so  _  dependent on her new,  _  parents. Time marches relentlessly . She looks up now, catching me  _  at her, causing her to say to her mother.\" Mom, Dad's looking at me  _  \". The last few days, I touch her arm, her face---  _  that when my wife and I return home, she will not be  _  us. I have so much to say, but no  _  with which to say it. My  _  changed from the day I drove this child home from the hospital. I saw myself  _  that day, and it has led to a lot of places that I would never have found on my own. She says, \"It'll be all right, Dad. I'll be home from school  _  .\" I tell her she will have a great year but I say little else. I am afraid somehow to speak and I only hold on to our good-bye hug a little longer, a little  _  . I gaze into her eyes and  _  to go. My wife's eyes follow her as she leaves us.  Mine  do not. Maybe if I don't look, I can imagine that she really hasn't  _  ; I know that what she is embarking upon is exciting and wonderful. I remember what the world looked like to me  _  everything was new. As I walk to the car with my wife at my side, my eyes are wet, my heart is sore, and I realize that my life is  _  forever.",
