As he huffed and puffed along, the team was  in practice  . The players soon started running sprints up and down the field. The man told himself \"I will  _  keep running until they quit.\" So he ran. And they ran. And he ran some more. And they kept running. And he kept running until he  _  finally run no more. He stopped in  _  . One of the players, equally out of breath, approached him and said in a crying voice, \"Boy, I am so glad that you finally stopped.  _  told us we had to keep running  as long as  the old guy who was jogging !\" He was watching them. They were watching him. He was letting them set his  _  , on the contrary, they allow him to set  _  . My question is this: Are you keeping  _  with somebody else in your daily life? Are you  _  people to set your standards for you? What about your standards, or  _  , for moral behavior or even your way of building up your own characteristics ? Or guidelines for what kind of life  _  you want? Negative or positive? Do you keep pace with those  _  you, or do you decided yourself just  _  you will live your life? The true is that only you are  _  to determine what your standards will be. Set your standards too low, and you will know only  _  . But set high standards and you can live an immeasurably full and  _  life. For only when you  reach for  the best that is within yourself, will you experience great living. Just as an old saying goes: \"Think big  _  , and win big success.\" Who is setting your standards?",
