Trying to save the eye, the doctors stitched  the eyeball together where it was cut,   _   a big ugly scar in the middle of my eye. And as I grew, this   _   eye in so many ways controlled me.\nI walked with my face looking at the   _   so people would not see the ugly me. Sometimes people, even strangers, asked me  _  questions or made hurtful remarks. When the kids played games, I was always the \"   _  \".\nYet Mama would say to me, \"Hold your head up high and face the world. If you hold your head up high, people will see your beautiful   _  .\"\nThose words have meant   _   things to me over the years. As a little child, I thought Mama meant, \"Be careful, or you will fall down or   bump into   something because you are not looking.\" As an adolescent, I found that sometimes when I held my head up high and let people   _   me, they liked me. My mama's words helped me begin to   _   that by letting people look at my face, I let them recognize the intelligence and beauty   _   both eyes.\nIn high school I was  _  both academically and socially. I was even elected class president,   _  , all I really wanted was to look like everyone else. When things got really bad, I would   _  to my mama and she would look at me with   _   eyes and say, \"Hold your head up high and face the world. Let them see the beauty that is inside.\"\nWhen I met the man who became my   _   for life, we looked each other straight in the eye, and he told me I was beautiful inside and out. He   _   it. My mama's love and   _   were the spark that gave me the confidence to   _   my own doubt.",
