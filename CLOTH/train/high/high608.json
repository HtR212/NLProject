    "article": "This was my grandmother's first Christmas without grandfather. When we reached her house, it did seem a little  _  without grandfather. Grandfather had always said the Christmas  _  was the most important. So we set to work assembling the beautiful  _  tree that was stored in grandfather's closet . After we finished, we stepped back to  _  our work. It looked wonderful. But something was  _  . \"Where's the star?\" I asked. It was my grandmother's  _  . As we emptied box after box and found no star, my grandmother's eyes  _  with tears. Grandfather had given it to Grandmother fifty years ago. Now, on her first Christmas without  _  , the star was gone, too. \"Let's  _  in the closet where the tree was,\" my sister Donna said. We  _  under beds and over shelves, inside and outside  _  we had exhausted every possibility. We could see Grandmother was  _  , although she tried not to show it. By now, it was  _  outside, and time for bed, as Santa would soon be here. The next morning, my sisters and I  woke up  early to see what Santa had left under the tree. After breakfast, the family sat together to  _  presents. \"The last gift is to Grandmother from Grandfather.\" Father said, in a puzzled voice. \"From who?\" There was  _  in my grandmother's voice. \"I found that  _  in the closet when we got the tree down,\" Mother explained. My grandmother opened it. Her face lit up when she pulled out a(n)  _  golden star. There was a note attached. Her voice trembled as she read it: Don't be  _  with me, dear. I broke your star while putting away the tree. Thought it was time for a new one, I hope it brings you as much  _  as the first one. Merry Christmas.",
