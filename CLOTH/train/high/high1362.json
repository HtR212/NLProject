She and her parents had travelled to Ho Chi Minh City by plane from Canton, Ohio of the USA. As they became  _  to the village, hundreds of cheering  _  stood in lines at the  _  to the Hoa Lac School, a two-story building that Carly had  _  money for. Carly started helping  others  when she was eight. She often walked about to send Thanksgiving baskets at church to families in need. When she saw one girl  wearing  very little in a snowy day and others didn't have warm  _  , she went door-to-door asking for  _  coats, hats, gloves, and scarves, then handed them  _  to the poor families with the baskets. However, Carly wanted to do  _  more--she wanted to \"change these children's  _  with her efforts\". She remembered that her grandmother's Rotary club had collected money to build a  _  in Vietnam a few years ago. She wanted to build a school,  _  . She put together a short show on the people and culture of Vietnam to his audience.  _  her new braces made it  _  to make the speech, she was full of enthusiasm, \"I want to give them a place to  _  their lives better.\" That summer, Carly  set off  with her family across Ohio, visiting three or four Rotary clubs a week. \"We travelled like  _  people to all these meetings,\" said her mother. In two years, Carly had raised $50,000. At the donation  _  in Hoa Lac, the school principal was deeply  _  by the little girl. \"How wonderful it is,\" he said, \"that a girl at her age wants to do something for kids so far away.\"",
