    "article": "October is usually a happy time for me ---- my grandchildren , Daniel and Carly , get all excited about Halloween . They often spend time dreaming of their activities and candies a few weeks  _  . More than anything else, though, they love  _  best. But not just any pumpkins . They wanted the ones  _  by their great aunt Margret--- my sister. I  _  to joke that she had a  _  place in her backyard that attracted those kids deeply .That's where the pumpkins grew. She and the kids  looked after  the pumpkins, putting a wooden box under each one so it wouldn't roll down to the ground. Whenever I took my grand children to visit Margaret, they would  _  say hello to her before running into the  _  to see what was going on there. They harvested them and used the  _  ones for Halloween. I didn't know why or how pumpkins grew in such a place  _  Margret had never planted seeds there before. Maybe she had just  _  an old pumpkin out there. She was good at gardening, though. I hoped that I had been given Margret's  _  gardening. What would my grandchildren do this first Halloween after my sister  _  ? I wished there were some other ways to make the day  _  so as to let Daniel and Carly know their great-aunt's  _  lived on. Next day I went to  _  the kids. Upon walking in, I was greeted by their quickest hello, \"Grandma! Grandma! Come and see!\" \"See what? \" \" Just come!\" they said,  _  my hands and pulling me with them. We went outside. There, right on the side of the house, were six pumpkins, growing in a place where  _  had ever been planted before. I said, \"You know what great- aunt Margret would do if she were here...\" We all ran to the kitchen to get some  _  . The big pumpkins were used for Halloween. Those left were used to beautify the front doorway. They lasted for  _  and served as an autumn-long reminder for my two little pumpkin kids.",
