Just being together would be enough.\nWe weren't the only family in our small community who would have a  _  Christmas. But the knowledge that others were going through the same thing didn't  _  much.\nOne night we had a small pity party for each other.\n\"How can I even wear that same old dress one more time?\" I  _  .\n\"I know,\" said my sister. \"I think I might as well give up asking for a  _  .\"\nThe next day, Mom told us that she had been saving up and shopping around so that we could give the Walters family a Christmas basket.\n\"If anyone needs some  _  , it's the Walters.\" Mom reminded us.\nThe Walters! They were the strangest people we knew. How could Mom be so  _  with them when our own family didn't have enough?\nMom was determined. She packed flour and sugar, a small turkey, some fruits in a basket and asked us to  _  it to the Walters.\nI really didn't like to have anything to do with them. Not wanting to be  _  , we left the basket on the doorstep and hid behind a nearby bush.\nSeeing the Walters gather up their basket, I asked in whisper, \"Did they look happy?\"\n\"Well, yeah, happy, but mostly they looked like they were thinking, Maybe we do belong.\"\nChristmas morning arrived.

She couldn't  _  to meet her \"gift\".\n\"Mom, how did you do all this?\" I asked. \"We were  _  for a no-present Christmas.\"\n\"Oh, not necessarily  _  but just helping each other. Mrs. Olsen at the dress shop let me bring your gift home. Dad offered to hang up Mrs. Marshall's tree lights. Mr. Jones had a horse and he was  _  to know we had someone to love it.\"\n\"I thought since you were giving away food to the Walters, we would never have enough. They really don't have anything to give in  _  .\"\n\"We are like a big family. Never  _  who can or who can't give. The most important is that we should listen to our hearts. Perhaps the right gifts will end up with the right families.\"\nMom always knew  _  . Thinking about the expression on the Walters's faces when they discovered the Christmas basket, I realized their \"  _  \" feeling was more precious than any of the gifts.\nThat was the Christmas that I learned about the magic of  _  .",
