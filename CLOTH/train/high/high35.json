    "article": "My husband had just bought a new washing machine for me. I decided to use it the  _  day, and I washed a lot of things. Everything worked  _  , but I couldn't find  _  of my husband's socks though I had looked  _  for it. The next morning, I got ready for  _  as usual. When the bell rang, the students came in. I greeted them and told them  _  we were going to do  that day  . When I turned  _  to write on the blackboard, the class burst out  _  . They laughed and laughed. They laughed so much, in fact, that I was  _  the headmaster would be in to see all this. I asked the class to  stop  , but the  _  I talked , the more they laughed. So I thought I had better pay  _  attention to them and continue to write on the blackboard. When I did this, they laughed even more. Before long, the teacher who had the room next to  _  came to see  _  all the laughter was about. When he came in, he started  _  , too. \" Good Heavens!\" I said . \" Will  _  please tell me what is so  _  ? \" \" Oh, God, \" said the teacher. \" You have a brown  _  stuck to the back of your shirt. \" So that's  _  I found my husband's missing sock. \" Oh, well, \" I said to the class, \" Let's just say you have had an unforgettable lesson on static electricity .\"",
