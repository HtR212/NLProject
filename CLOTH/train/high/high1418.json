    "article": "Once in Japan there lived two frogs, one of whom made his home near the town of Osaka, while the other lived in Kyoto.  _  , they didn't know each other. Bothof them liked to see a little of the world: the Kyoto frog wanted to visit Osaka, and the Osaka frog wished to go to Kyoto.\nSo one morning they  set out  . However, the journey was more  _  than they had expected, for they didn't know much about traveling. Half-way between the two towns, at the top of a mountain, the two frogs  _  each other! Soon they fell into  _  .\n\"What a(n)  _  we are too small, \" said the Osaka frog. \"Otherwise, we could see both towns from here, and  _  if it is worth our going on.\"\n\"Oh, that is easily  _  ,\" replied the Kyoto frog. \"We have only got to stand up on our hind   legs, and hold on to each other  so that  we won't fall down, and then we can both look at the towns we are  _  to.\"\nThis idea  _  the   Osaka frog; he stood up and put his front paws on the  _  of the other frog, who had risen also. There they both stood, stretching themselves as  _  as they could. The Kyoto frog turned his nose towards Osaka, and the Osaka frog, towards Kyoto, but the  _  frogs forgot that when they stood up, their eyes were in the backs of their heads, and that  _  their noses pointed to their destinations, yet their eyes looked at the places  _  which they had come.\n\"Dear me!\" cried the Osaka frog. \"Kyoto is  _  like Osaka. It is certainly not worth such a long journey.\"\n\"If I had known that Osaka was only a  _  of Kyoto I should never have traveled all this way,\"  _  the frog from Kyoto. Then they started off for their  _  again.",
