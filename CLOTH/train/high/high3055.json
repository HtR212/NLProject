    "article": "I was never a starter for my high school football team.No matter how  _  I practiced I was always on the second string.A few of us backups even  _  called ourselves the  _  boys and gave each other nicknames.Mine was \"Splinter .\" During one of the last games of the year,  _  there came a point when I finally  _  it onto the field with the starters.It was my  _  chance and I was determined to  _  myself.It wasn't long either before the ball unexpectedly  _  its way into my hands.I saw the end zone and turned to  _  down the field for a touchdown .It was my shining moment and it  _  so good.It lasted for about one second.That was when an  _  player crashed into my back.It was Splinter's first and last shining moment before  _  back to the bench. Since that time I have had a lot of shining moments in my life,  _  most of them probably didn't look that  _  in the eyes of the world.But I have come to see life from a  _  viewpoint.When I open a  _  for someone,share a smile with a  _  ,and laugh with my children then I know that I am glowing bright.When I stop to help another,pass on a  _  word,and do a loving act then I know that I am  _  .I have come to learn too that it is these shining moments that  make up  our lives here.",
