A  _  showed what we had in common: I had  _  in New York city from Germany while he had  _  from South America. We exchanged stories about the  _  of starting a new life in a new country. \"I've been  searching for  an apartment within walking distance from my  _  . And what I want is to have a good  _  of Central park! But I'm dreaming. I can't  _  to rent a room like that myself and I haven't found a roommate to share in expenses.\" The young man wrote a  _  down on a piece of paper. \"Her name's Carol and she is a good girl,\" he said. \"You'll  _  her, and she needs a roommate.\" I called her right away. \"I've been  _  to hear from you,\" said Carole, who lived near Central Park.  _  , she became my best roommate, and has been my  _  for 34 years. \"We were sure lucky to  _  each other,\" Carole said to me recently. \"But I wondered what took you so  _  to call.\" I said. \"I called right after I  ran into  your South American friend.\" Carole looked amazed. \"Not a friend,  _  I met him only once, and he told me about you. But that was a whole week before you finally  _  .\" \"But I don't understand; I didn't know him until that afternoon.\" \"Maybe he know of you before because you were  _  known in the company for your achievement.\" Though you are a small potato, if you work hard and do  _  , people will find you sooner or later.",
