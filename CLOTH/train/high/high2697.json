It turned out that just about all of my students also knew our custodian\nby name -all of them responded with smiles and  _  for\na long time about this time or that time when she'd  _  each\nof them in the hallway.That she felt she needed to apologize   _  a\nstrong reaction from many of the kids.\nAs the class period was about to end, I asked them to  _  the\nfloor like I do every period and thanked them for picking up any garbage  even if  it wasn't theirs.My entire class disappeared; they each disappeared instantly  _  their desks to pick up those annoying tiny pieces of paper\nthat  _  so easily from notebooks.One girl made a (an  _  that I later used with my other classes:\" Her job might be to clean the room, but she shouldn't have to clean up  _  us.There's a difference.\"\nI believe that people know the difference between right and wrong.I believe that people appreciate it when others  _  take care of them.And I believe that people, even adolescents who are not quite yet mature, appreciate it when they see someone who takes   _  in her work.Sometimes we need a   _  of the things we take for granted...things like a good custodian to take care of us.",
