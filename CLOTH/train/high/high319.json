    "article": "Teaching is challenging and teaching college is often a mixed bag. Sometimes my class feels more like a cafeteria, where students come and go,   _  in the middle of my lectures. Mostly these students have entered college right out of high school.  College seems to them like   no more than  a continuation of high school,   _   the sense of newness that often drives curiosity and achievement.\nBut there is a category of students that gives everyone reasons for   _  .They are the so called \"nontraditional students\" :those who, for one reason or   another  , didn't go to college when they were 18. but many years later. Some years back in my teaching, while calling out names from the name list on the first day,I noticed a gray haired woman of about 70.She was wandering in the doorway,   _   her new books like a schoolgirl.\n\"I'm not on the name list,\" she volunteered. \"But I was   _  if I could sit in for the first class, to see what marine   biology is about.\" This woman's eagerness   _  me, so I invited her to have a seat. I began the class with questions to get a (n)   _  of how much knowledge they were bringing to the course. As I questioned them about the difference between fishes and seagoing mammals, most of my new students remained   _  .But Natalie, the older woman, was on the edge of her seat,   _  answers.At the end of the class, she came up to me and apologized for being the \"extra\" student. She said,\"Will you   _   me another chance?\"   _   at losing her, I acted quickly to remove her   _  .\"I'll see you next class,\"I said.\nNatalie turned out to be a vital and   _  student.She commuted 50 miles each day to get to school, often in the severe winter, and never missed a class.  Apart from  this, she was enthusiastic about helping my younger students. Apparently these older students have the   _  over them. It lies in the broadth and depth of their path of life. After having   got over   numerous personal and professional barriers, they have an expansive world view.   _   a return to school may, at first, be frightening for them, they tend to make it because they are   _   great trouble to put their studies into an already full life.",
