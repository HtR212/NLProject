To us in the twenty-first century, in which man is able to move and communicate so rapidly, the   _   of the carriage seems nothing at all. Planes fly many hundreds of miles in an hour. And even without39 _  ,we can, by wireless or telephone, communicate within 40 _  with people on the other side of the 41 _  . \nThe benefits of the increased speeds are countless. Businessmen say travelling from Europe to America can 42 _ much time, for the journey that would once have taken weeks43 _ now, by air, only twenty-four hours. Members of one family separated from each other by long 44 _ can have talks with each other by telephone 45 _  as if they were sitting in the same room. \nNot all the effects of speed, 46 _ , are beneficial. People who are in the47 _ of using a motor car, 48 whenever they want to move half a mile, become lazy and49 _ the power of enjoying an active50 _ . Those who travel through a country at eighty miles an hour do not 51 _ much of the life to that country as they are52 _ .They become 53 _ anxious about moving quickly from one   _  to another that they are55 no longer able to relax and enjoy a happy journey.",
