    "article": "Have you ever imagined that you could be cloned like Dolly the sheep in the not too distant future?\nThe news that a human embryo has been  successfully  cloned for the first time has caused mixed reactions.\nThe  _  was carried out by scientists from the Advanced Cell Technology Inc(ACT), in Massachusetts, US. The group  made known  the news on November 25.\nThis is  not a cloned  human being. A clone is alive, it walks, it breathes, said Jamie Grifo, a(n)  _  on the study of cloning at New York University School of Medicine.\n\"This is a set of cells in a lab that will be used to  _  someone's life.\"\nSuch research could lead to treatment for  _  such as heart diseases, AIDS and even cancer,   according to  scientists.\nDespite high hopes from other scientists, the news raised concerns immediately from religious and political leaders. Several  _  in the US do not allow human cloning. President George W. Bush also made it clear that he is  against  any type of human cloning. However, the scientists at ACT said they have no interest at present in  _  an early embryo into  a baby  .\nAnimals have been cloned repeatedly since Dolly the sheep  appeared  in 1997. And there were no real technical  _  to stand in the way of scientists making a cloned human embryo.\nThis time the research group used traditional cloning technology with a human  _  .   _  it was given DNA from an adult cell, the egg began to  grow  .   _  it was stopped from becoming a baby--at a stage in which it was  _  a ball of cells. The   _  technology has been used to clone sheep, cattle and monkeys.",
