What should I   _  ?\" he asked himself.\n\"Come on, son, we don't have much   _  . I have to attend an important meeting,\" his dad said.\n\"These are all my   _   and I don't know what to choose.\" He picked up some bags and then put them   _  . He couldn't make up his mind. \"  Hurry up  , son, we have no time. I'm very   _  ,\" his dad said. So the boy ran around the store   _  again. His eyes moved from one bag to another,   _  all of the sweets looked so good and he couldn't make up his mind.   _  , the dad had enough. He caught his son by the hand and they  walked out of  the store empty-handed. The boy   _  . He wanted them all, but ended up with   _  becasue he couldn't choose just one.\nSome of us are that boy. The   _   is that candy store. We have a great number of choices available to us, but if we don't make a(n)   _  about our jobs, education, relationships, marriage or other   _   things, we will end up empty-handed.
