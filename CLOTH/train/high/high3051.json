The next day I decided to go back to the  _  , curious if the little girl would still be there. Right in the very  _  as she was yesterday, she sat with the  _  look in her eyes.  _  I began walking towards her, I could see the back of the little girl's dress indicated a disability. I guessed maybe that was the  _  the people just passed by and made no effort to help. But I wanted to help her, so I  _  to let her know it was OK. I sat down beside her and  _  with a simple \"hello\". The little girl was  _  and replied a \"hi\" in a low voice. I asked the girl why she was so sad. The little girl looked at me and said, \"Because I'm  _  . \" I immediately said, \"That you are!\"and smiled. The little girl acted  _  sadder, and she said, \"I know.\" \"Little girl,\" I said, \"you  _  me of a sweet angel.\" She looked at me and smiled. Slowly she stood to her  _  , and said, \"Really?\" \"Yes, dear, you're  _  a little guardian angel sent to watch over all those people walking by.\" She  _  her head \"yes\". Then she spread her wings and said, \"I am. I'm your guardian angel.\" I was  _  by what I was seeing. She continued to say, \"Because you think of someone other than yourself, my job here is done.\" Immediately, I also  _  to my feet and said, \"Wait, so why did  no one  stop to help an angel?\" She looked at me and smiled, \"You're the only one who could see me, and you  _  an angel in your heart.\"",
