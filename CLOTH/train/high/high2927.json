I  _  him, \"Not exactly, sir.\" The old man wanted me to follow him to see  _  great. We walked a couple of blocks until we came upon the downtown El Paso Public  _  . He asked me to sit down while he was looking for something  _  between the shelves. A few moments  _  , he returned with a couple of old books. He then sat down,  _  , \"There are two things that I want to teach you Number one is  _  to judge a book by its cover, for a cover can  _  you. As a matter of fact, I am one of the  _  men in the world and have all the things that money can buy.  _  a year ago, my wife died, and since then l have been  _  thinking about my life. I realized there were certain things I had not yet  _  in life, one of which was  _  it would be like to live like a  _  on the streets. I promised to do  _  that for one year. For the past year, I have been going from city to city doing just that. So, you see, don't ever judge a  _  by its cover, for a cover can fool you \" \"Number two is to learn how to read, my boy. For there is  _  one thing that people can't take away from you, and that is your  _  .\" At that moment, he put my right hand in his and put them upon the books he had  _  from the shelves. They were the writings of Plato and Aristotle --great classics from ancient times.",
