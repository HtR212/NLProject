    "article": "Once an Arab was traveling in the desert. When the sun went down in the west, he stopped and  put up  his tent then, made a fire and have a  _  meal. When night fell, he  _  down to sleep. He had  _  fallen asleep when he felt a soft  _  on his elbow . He woke up to find that his camel had put his head inside the tent. The camel said: \"Would you please let me keep my head in the tent to get warm? It is so cold outside. I will not take up too much  _  .\" The Arab was a  _  man, \"All right, do as you  please  .\" he said. Then he turned on his  _  and went back to sleep. It wasn't long  _  he felt a push on his shoulder. It was the camel again. \"Dear master,\" the camel said, \"my head is quite warm now, but my neck is still cold. Do you mind  _  I keep it inside the tent, too?\" \"  No, not at all  .\" the man said. But this time he felt a bit  _  , as camel had such a long neck. No sooner had he shut his eyes  _  he got a harder push in his side. This time the camel said, \"will you please allow me to bring my front legs inside and warm then a little?\" The Arab  _  over to one side of the tent. He made  himself  as small as he could. It was not  a bit  comfortable, and sleep was now out of  the question  .Soon after that the camel gave his a rough push and said, \"The tent is too small for the two of us.  Besides  , my two hind legs are still left in the cold. It is only  _  that you should leave the tent wholly to me.\" And with that, the camel kicked the poor man out.",
