    "article": "Grandma lost her husband long ago, and I knew very little about my grandfather other than what a wonderful man he had been to anyone who had known him.\nThat afternoon, I   _   myself standing in front of an old wooden box with my grandmother by my side. The box hadn't been opened in years. Grandma had been   putting off   opening it, which was sure to be a(n)   _   experience. \nThe moment the air hit the wooden box's inside, a strong flow of wood smell made its way to our   _  . As my grandmother   _   the first item out of its tomb, I could see that the piece of clothing was very old, but at the same time it   _   very new. It was my grandfather's wool flying   _   from World War II. Grandma hugged it to her   _   for several moments before holding it out in front of her, as if she could see my grandfather   _   it. I simply sat and watched, waiting for her to tell me about it and about   _  .\nGrandpa had been a pilot during the war.   _   Grandpa first decided to fly, his dream had been to man bomber planes; he   _   wanted to be on the frontline of the air defense. After taking the appropriate instruction, he was   _   from the bombing corps   because of his imperfect eyesight, and his dream was over. For Grandma, this was her dream come true; Grandpa's chances of returning home   _   to his new wife and daughter were much   _   with his new job as a liaison pilot  .\nAs my grandmother told my grandfather's   _  , she mindlessly examined his jacket, putting her hand down one sleeve, turning to see its back, and sticking her fingers   _   each lined pocket. In the breast pocket of my grandfather's jacket was a small black and white   _  . It was my smiling grandfather standing in front of his large plane, his \"Little Louise,\" which was   _   on the plane's nose. I knew   _   that the plane's nickname   was a loving reference to my grandmother, whose given name was Louise.",
