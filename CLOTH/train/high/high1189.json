    "article": "It was lunchtime and I walked into a small branch bank on the West Side. I had come to  _  a checking account. The only officer on  _  was a fortyish black man, standing  _  a small counter from a young white boy who was wearing a V-necked sweater. I thought I was especially  _  of the boy because he looked more like from a prep school than a  _  in a West Side bank. The boy continued to  _  my attention because of what happened next. He was holding an open savings-account book and  _  an expression of disappointment. \"But I don't understand. I opened the account myself, so why can't I  _  any money?\" the boy said, his voice breaking. \"I know it is, but those are the rules. I've already explained to you that a fourteen-year-old is not  _  to withdraw money without a letter from his parents,\" the officer explained patiently. Suddenly I noticed the  _  had a series of small deposits and withdraws. Then I questioned the officer, \"How do you  _  that? Why did you let him withdraw money before, but not now?\" He looked  _  . \"Because the tellers were not aware of his age before and now they are. It's really very  _  .\" I turned to the boy with a shrug. \"You're really getting  _  ,\" I said. \"You ought to get your parents to come here and protest.\" The boy looked destroyed.  _  , he put his savings book in a rear-pocket and walked out of the bank. The officer turned to me. \"You know,\" he said, \"you really shouldn't have got  _  .\" I couldn't believe what he was saying. \"We were  _  this morning that some neighborhood bully has been shaking down this boy for more than a month. The guy was  _  him to take money out every week and hand it over. The poor kid was  _  too scared to tell anyone. Anyway, the police are on the case and they'll probably make a(n)  _  today.\" \"You mean there is no rule about being too young to withdraw money from a savings account?\" \"Not that I ever heard of. Now, sir, what can we do for you?\"",
