My father wrote me a valuable letter before his death, one part of which always  stands out  . \"I know you will do  _  great that will set you among the very best one day in the future.\" Since I first read his  _  at 12, they have lived in my heart.  Growing up  ,I knew that my dad's believing in me gave me permission to believe in  _  . \"You will do something great.\" He didn't know  _  that would mean, but whenever I felt  _  of myself, I remember my father's words, and  _  he were here, so I could ask, \"Is this what you were  _  about, Dad?\" Many years have passed, and I believe that my father  _  have been proud when I  _  from basic training and became a rescue swimmer. Lately, I've come to realize he'd want me to move  _  to what comes next: to be proud of, and believe in someone else. Yes, it's time to all of us to  _  writing our own letters to our children. They look to us with the same  _  . \"Is this it, Daddy? Am I doing fine?\" It's why every child growing up says, \"Watch me!\" Our children don't  hold back  because they are not afraid to fail. They are only afraid of failing  _  . Remember to give your children  _  to succeed. If you don't have children, then write a letter to someone who  looks up to  you. They are waiting for you to believe in them. Trust me, love will be  _  real and their belief in themselves will be greater if you write the words on their hearts: \"  Never fear  ! You will do something great.\" Not having that blessing from someone they love may be the only thing holding them back.",
