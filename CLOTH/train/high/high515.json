    "article": "DOCTOR:  So, what seems to be the problem?\nPATIENT:  Well, for about a week now I   have been feeling   very dizzy. I even thought I was going to faint once or twice.\nDOCTOR:  I see.   Have you been eating   as usual?\nPATIENT:  Well, to tell the truth I   haven't had   much of an appetite recently. I'm just not hungry.\nDOCTOR:  You need to eat regularly, you know, even if you're not hungry.\nPATIENT:  I know but I haven't wanted to eat anything recently.\nDOCTOR:  Hmm. Any other symptoms?   Have you had   headaches or any other aches or pains?\nPATIENT:  Well, I   have taken   my blood pressure three times this week, and it's a lit bit high.\nDOCTOR:  I will check that in a minute.   Have you been working   harder than usual?\nPATIENT:  Yes, I suppose I have. This is a very important time of the year for us and things have been incredibly busy recently. I   have been getting   home very late, and to be honest, I    haven't been sleeping   very well for the last few days.\nDOCTOR:  I think you   have been overworking   . I want you to take a week off work and have a complete rest.\nPATIENT:  I couldn't possibly take a week off right now. I   have just been promoted   to head of the department.\nDOCTOR:  Well, I'm afraid they'll just have to manage without you. You can't take risks with your heath.",
