I quickly  _  the kids and they led me to a tiny squirrel still with milk\nteeth. I  bent down  and held the little creature up\ngently in my arms to check it for  _  . It seemed fine.\nI figured the mother must have been killed, leaving it an orphan . Now, the baby was pretty hungry for   _  and then left its nest to search the\nneighborhood for help.\nI was about to carry it into my   _  when I found several other\nbabies  _  to run down the tree from where their\nnest was. With the first squirrel hid into my  _  , I\nstood at the base of the tree and was  _  when\nthree more babies ran right down into my hands. Those dear little creatures\nwere so happy to feel safe and  _  , and they all held\neach other close in my shirt. I took them home and  _  them\nbread and milk to eat. The poor starving things went  _  as\nthey swallowed the meal.\nI phoned a lady in the next town who   _  a small squirrel shelter.\nShe had a big back yard with large  _  surrounded\nby a tall wooden fence. She assured me she was well  _  to\ncare for the babies and provide a natural home for them when they were grown.\nI love that those little girls cared enough about the squirrels to seek out the   _  of the Animal Lady! And I really  _  getting\nto help the baby creatures. And then the  _  of\ncaring continued  _  the lady with the squirrel shelter\ntook them in. How wonderful to be part of a chain of kindness.",
