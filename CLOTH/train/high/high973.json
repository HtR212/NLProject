The doctor had said there wasn't anything more that could be done, that he should take the Cat home and make him as  _  as possible. The man put the Cat on his lap and  _  The Cat opened his eyes, purred and looked up at the Man. A tear  _  down the Man's cheek and  _  on the Cat's forehead. The Cat gave him a slightly annoyed look. \" Why do you cry, Man?\" the Cat asked. \"Because you can't  _  the thought of losing me? Because you think you can never replace me?\" The Man  _  \"yes\". \"And where do you think I'll be  _  I leave you?\" the Cat asked. The Man shrugged helplessly. \"  _  your eyes, Man,\" the Cat said. The Man gave him a questioning look, but did as he was told. \"What color are my eyes and fur?\" the Cat asked. \" Your eyes are gold and your fur is a rich, warm brown,\" the Man replied. \"And where is it that you most often  _  me?\" asked the Cat. \"I see you. . . on the kitchen window  _  the birds ...,on my favorite chair. . . on my desk lying on the papers I need. . . on the pillow next to my  _  at night. \" \"Then, whenever you wish to see me, all you must do is close your eyes,\" said the Cat. \"Pick up that piece of string from the floor----there, my 'toy' .\" he Man opened his eyes, then  _  over and picked up the string. It was about two feet long and the Cat had been able to  _  himself for hours with it. '\"Now take each end of the string in one hand,\" the Cat ordered. The Man did so. \"The end in your left hand is my birth and the end in your right hand is my  _  . Now bring the two ends together,\" the Cat said. The Man obeyed. \"You have made a continuous  _  ,\" said the cat. \"Does any point along the string appear to be different, worse or better than any other part of the string?\" The Man inspected the string and then  _  his head \" no\". The Man shut his eyes hard as the tears poured down his face. He saw the Cat on the  _  , then in his bed, then lying across his important papers. He saw him on the pillow next to his head, saw his bright gold eyes and darkest brown on his nose and ears. He opened his eyes and  _  his tears looked over at the circle of string he still held in his hand. One day, not long after, there was a new Cat on his lap. She was lovely and white...very different from his earlier  _  Cat and very much the same.",
