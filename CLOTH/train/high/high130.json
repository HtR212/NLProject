And why?\nIn the 1950s, Albert Einstein and Thomas Harvey  _  each other when they both lived in Princeton, New Jersey. Einstein was working at Princeton University  _  Doctor Harvey was working at Princeton Hospital. When Einstein died, Doctor Harvey was  called on  to examine his body. It was then that he started to study  _  has become a long time examination of Einstein's brain. His goal was to  _  some physical evidence of the scientist's genius .\nDoctor Harvey,  _  did not tell Eintein's family that he  _  the great man's brain. It was only later  _  the family learned of Doctor Harvey's work. They did not  like  the idea at first. After Doctor Harvey explained his idea to them, they agreed to  _  him to study the brain. Doctor Harvey then asked  two other  scientists to help. They cut the brain  _  three pieces. They marked each piece before placing it in containers  _  chemical formaldehyde to protect it. Doctor Harvey has been  _  Einstein's brain since then. He has carried it with him as he moved from place to place. He has also lent parts of the brain to other scientists  _  study.\nOnly one researcher has found something  _  . A doctor at the University of California found that the left part of Einstein's brain has more certain cells than  _  . Such cells are known to feed brain. This may mean that the cells could affect intelligence.",
