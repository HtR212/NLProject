WhenI got up to get a cup of coffee and a  _  ,I noticed a middle-aged woman nearby.She had  _  been caught in a fire of some sort. Her face had been seriously  _  ,so that the skin looked very tight.She almost had no nose.and her eyes were tiny.I took a deep breath,and went back to my  _  ,thinking how brave she was to come out and  _  public.I also felt  _  of myself for shuddering and looking down while I  _  back to my seat,unable to send even a weak  _  her way As I was sipping my coffee and eating my cookie,I kept thinking about  _  I should ignore this moment and just  _  my own business,or do something about my feelings.I couldn't let it go.I went for a refill of coffee and to get another cookie,  _  this time I made my way slowly  _  the wonan,said,\"Isn't he a wonderful performer?\"and gave her a largest smile I was able to give.To my  _  ,she looked right at me and gave me a huge SMILE in return! I'm sure it took this woman a  _  time to find her smile after her terrible  _  .I believe that my smile  _  her day,and hers also made me very happy.She seemed to have  _  to find peace with herself,and I was  _  ,because her smile had made her beautiful Sometimes it takes  _  to smile,considering how hard life can be.",
