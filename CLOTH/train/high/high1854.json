Suddenly I   _   a tiny figure, bent and covered with some bits of cloth, shivering with the  _   from the north winds that were   _   so hard that night.\nIt was an old man of 75, seated in the    _    of this street, waiting for anyone who would think of    _    him a single coin or a cup of hot tea. I was about to open my biscuit packet ,    _    my mind and soul went out to this   _    person. \nI   _   my husband to go over and hand it to this old man.  He looked into my husband's   _    and smiled, I could see that smile from the    _    window and he said, \"Thank you.\" I felt so   _    and hoped that he could live through the cold night. \nI was    _    to visit again and find out how he was the next day, as I have to pass this way every day.  I did so, the next evening, and he   _   the car and came up to my    _    and smiled at me. My    _    went out once more and this time I offered him a bag of food.  He reached out for the    _    and I gave him my hand , he held it and   _    and said, \" Thanks for this help.\"  I looked at him and told my husband, \"Doesn't he remind you of my Daddy who was once a beggar years ago ? \"\nAt a     _    look, I saw my Daddy in this old man, waiting for anyone to show him some mercy or love .Maybe one day, it could    _    to one of us, so please do not pass by a poor person without offering at least a word of love and a kind smile or an act of kindness.",
