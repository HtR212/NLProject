    "article": "Burned Toast\nWhen I was a kid, my mom liked to make breakfast food for dinner every now and then. And I remember one night in particular when she had made dinner after a long, hard day at  _  .\nOn that evening so long ago, my mom placed a plate of eggs, sausage and extremely burned toast in front of my dad. I remember  _  to see if anyone noticed!  _  all my dad did was reach for his toast,  _  at my mom and ask me how my day was at school. . . I don't remember what I told him that night, but I do remember  _  him spread butter and jelly on that toast and eat every bite!\nWhen I got up from the table that evening, I remember hearing my mom  _  to my dad for burning the toast. And I'II never  _  what he said: \"Honey, I love burned toast.\" Later that night, I went to kiss Daddy good night and I asked him if he really  _  his toast burned. He wrapped me in his arms and said,\" Your Momma put  _  a hard day at work today and she's really  _  . And besides, a burned toast never  _  anyone! \"\n  _  is full of imperfect things... and imperfect people.  I'm not the best at anything, and I forget  _  and anniversaries just like everyone else. But what I've learned over the years is that learning to accept each other's  _  ---and choosing to  _  each other's differences---is one of the most important keys to creating a healthy, growing, and  _  relationship where a burned toast isn't a deal-breaker!\nWe could extend this to any  _  . In fact, understanding is the  _  of any relationship, whether it is a husband-wife or parent-child or friendship!\n\"Don't put the key to your  _  in someone else's pocket---keep it in your own.\"\nSo please pass me a toast, and yes, a  _  one will be fine!",
