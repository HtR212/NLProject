He placed the basket under a tree and then he46 gathered up the children in the village.\nThe man drew a47 _ in the dirt, looked at the children, and said,\"When I tell you to48 _ , run to the tree and49 _ gets there first will win the basket of the fruits.\"When he told them to run, they all50 _ each other's hands and ran together to the tree. Then they51 _ together around the basket and enjoyed their52 _ as a group.\nThe anthropologist was53 _ . He asked why they would all go together when one of them could have won all the fruits for himself or herself. A54 _ girl looked up at him and said55 _ ,\"How can one of us be happy if all the other ones are56 _ ?\"\nYears later, the well-known South African activist Desmond Tutu would describe the little girl's57 _ process by using the word ubuntu, which means\"I am because58 _ are.\"People in that tribe believe that a person is a person through other people.
