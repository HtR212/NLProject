    "article": "For most of my 15 years, my father usually said very little to my mother and me. He  _  reading the newspaper or  _  football matches on television to talking to his family. Everything  _  one morning. As soon as I came downstairs to breakfast, I could see that he wasn't his  _  reserved self. \"Can't wait! FIFA World Cup! Big match! Must see!\" I quickly figured out what all the  _  was about: Dad is a big football fan. I had never been interested in football,  _  Dad's excitement that morning made me more and more curious. I had to  find out  why this sport was making my normally reserved father act like a five-year-old on his first  _  to Disneyland. Dad decided that we should all eat at a little German restaurant so that we  _  watch the World Cup while eating. Secretly, I think he was hoping to  _  Mum and me into football fans. The match started a few  _  after we entered the restaurant. As I was eating my meal, a loud noise came from the television.  _  , I looked up at the TV: \"Why is that man jumping up and down?\" Dad  _  explained: \"That's Papa Bouba Diop, my son. It's normal for them to jump up and down after they've scored.\" Dad  _  almost everything to me. His monosyllabic answers were a thing of the past. I loved the  _  Dad! I watched the rest of the match, becoming more and more  _  . When I told my father that I planned to watch  _  matches with him, he smiled and gave me a wink . At long last we had something in  _  .  _  has really helped Dad and me get closer and  _  a stronger relationship with each other. Who says football is only about 22 men running after a silly ball?",
