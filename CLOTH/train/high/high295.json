The best part of this job was that I was the only  _  , so I got a good chance to understand Chinese culture and practice my  _  . Actually, I have got  more than  I supposed to. I have got valuable experience, devoted friends and the feeling that I am not laowai anymore. Guests were pleasantly surprised to see me there, because I was an interpreter, trip adviser, and  _  guide at the same time, which made their life much  _  . I met people from all over the world, who came to China for the first time,  _  who knew China better than me.  Thanks to  my Chinese colleagues, who had answers to all the questions about  _  , I could explain why you should  _  before you buy, why Chinese don't let guests  pay for  dinner, why it is not common to book a taxi and why it is better to catch  _  on the street. I also had chances to  _  the development of China. The waiters and managers were not only my teachers, but  most of the time  my friends. If I needed help, they were  _  to help me. I enjoyed our small conversations  _  they were kind and educated. I was very proud and happy of the fact that all of them  _  me and I don't feel  _  anymore. The best part of my job was to see people coming  back to  the hotel. When they recognized me, they  _  share their adventures, burdens, even thoughts with me. It means the world to me. I spent there 8 months and it was a period when I was proud to be who I am.",
