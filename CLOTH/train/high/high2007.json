    "article": "I was in the queue for the supermarket checkout earlier today.All of the checkouts were  _  , and the woman behind me was not happy! Every word that came from her mouth was a(n)  _  ! She wasn't happy with the number of checkouts  _  ; she wasn't happy with the amount of shopping some people had in their baskets; she wasn't happy because this supermarket didn't have a stand where she  _  scan her own shopping. I listened to her  _  looking around as I loaded my stuff onto the conveyor belt .I didn't want  _  to do with that kind of attitude, and if ever I'd felt like letting someone go  _  of me, it wouldn't be such a woman! But then I  _  back.Standing beside the woman was a five-year-old girl,  _  her granddaughter.The girl's part of the shopping  _  of some comic books. I couldn't  _  it.I pushed my shopping back to the end of the conveyor belt,  _  a space.\"After you,\" I said to the woman and the girl, and  _  them to a big  _  .The woman was delighted, and even  _  to complain ---- until she was walking away. So,  _  bother having helped? It was because that little girl was probably taking in her granny's complaint like a sponge .She was learning how to  deal with  situations like that by listening to her granny.I'd seen that I could interrupt that complaining, and put a smile and some  _  into the middle of it. We can all complain; we can all react  _  , but it doesn't have to be like that.And, even if only for a few  _  , I wanted to leave that little soul with just a glimpse of another way.",
