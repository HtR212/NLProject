The  _  I am trying to make is that anyone can become an addict.\nThe only way that I  _  this out was by becoming an addict myself. I used to be a guy who was  _  by most of my friends. I had never lived with the  _  that I had no friends, so I did almost anything to  _  the two good friends I still had. One of the things I did was  keep  drugs for the first time. This was a big  _  from the way I lived when I was younger. I was a(n)  _  , and the last thing I thought I would get into was drugs. Drugs  _  me from being the best sports player I could be.\nI  _  to smoke drugs after I entered high school because that was what my new \"cool\" friends were  _  . The next three years were filled with many  highs and lows  , I was arrested twice, and lost my license for two years. This made me sad and  _  .\nI realized I could not live this way; I must stop the  _  of using drugs.\nSince then, my  _  and actions have changed and so has my direction in life. I do see a future in water skiing.  _  , I haven't killed my chance in  _  . I know that I must keep a clear head first. Keep Coming Back. It works if you work it.",
