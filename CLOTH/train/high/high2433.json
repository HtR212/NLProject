    "article": "Life on Land probably began about 430 millions years ago, though it has existed in the water for perhaps as much as 3,000 million years. When we think of the first thing on land, we probably think of strange  _  coming out of the oceans, but in fact no animals could have been  _  if plants had not been on land first. Plants had to be on land before animals arrived. They  _  the first land animals with the surrounding and food necessity, since then, the plants are the only form of life that is able to get and store  _  . The first plants to exist out of water were probably  _  kinds of algae ( ) which were  _  by other plants that grow  _  to the ground and needed water in which to reproduce. Once the move to land had been made, however, evolution took place quickly. By the end of 100 million years, plants had developed their  _  , and some had got tree-like forms since  _  was very important in gaining sunlight. About 30 million years ago, much of the world was covered with forests of huge trees. In most ways they were like  _  modern trees. They had roots, leaves, wood, but mostly they had not developed seeds.",
