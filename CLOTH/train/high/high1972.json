    "article": "Ellen Granz lied to her teacher about why she hadn't done her homework, but, of course , many students have lied to their teachers. The  _  is that Ellen Glanz was a 28-year-old high school teacher who was a student for six months to  _  her teaching by gaining a fresh perspective  of her school.\nShe found many classes  _  , students doing as little as necessary to pass tests. She concluded that many students have little power and  _  for their own education.\nEllen Glanz found herself doing the  _  things. There was the day when Glanz wanted to join her friend's party to  _  the purchase of a new house, but she had  _  for a math class. For the first time , she knew how students feel when they think something is more  _  than homework.\nShe found a way out and told the  _  , \"I considered my choices: admit  _  to the teacher, copy someone else's sheet, or make up an excuse .\"She chose the  _  one ---- the one most widely  _  ----and told the teacher that the  _  needed to complete the homework had been ripped   from her book. The teacher accepted the story, never  _  her book. In fact, nobody else did the homework .\n\"Finally,\"Glanz said, \"the teacher , thinking that the homework must have been difficult,  went over  each question at the blackboard while students copied the  _  at their seats. The teacher had  _  the material and the students had listened to the explanation. But had anything been  _  ? I don't think so .\" Glanz found these things were  _  in many classes . Students simply didn't do the homework, but copied from someone else or  _  the teacher into doing the work for them.",
