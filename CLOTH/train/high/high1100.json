    "article": "A couple in South Carolina has been eagerly seeking an organ donor. They haven't found one  _  . But they did find something else: friends.\nLarry Swilling and his wife Jimmie Sue have been happily  _  for 56 years. So happily, in fact, that Larry has now come to realize he can't  _  without his wife. \"She's my heart,\" he said. The problem with Jimmie Sue is that she  _  a kidney . Jimmie Sue was born with only one, and now that doesn't  _  . She needs a transplant but neither her husband, nor anyone tested in her family, is a  _  match.\nJimmie Sue is trying to get on a donor list, but the  _  is about two or three years long and that's for a kidney from a dead donor. Transplant patients who get their kidneys from living donors tend to live  _  . That is why Larry decided to try to ask for it, from total strangers.\n\"I don't  _  what people think,\" Larry said. He tells his wife, \"I'm going to  _  you a kidney.\" And on the street, wearing a signboard \"Need kidney for my wife\", he's not shy in asking  _  :\"Could I use your kidney?\" For the last couple weeks, Larry, at 77, has been walking all over his hometown and the surrounding towns-basically  begging for  a kidney. He didn't really think it would work.  _  he said, \"I had to do something.\" He didn't feel  _  when the phone rang. \"I'm willing to donate a kidney for your  _  ,\" one caller said. \"I'd like nothing more than to help you out,\" said another.\nBelieve it or not, over the last few days the  _  hasn't stopped ringing. Hundreds of people who either saw his sign or heard about it have  _  . One volunteer said, \"I've got two, but I  _  need one.\" Larry hasn't found a match for his wife, but at least he has already had enough volunteers and  _  enough awareness to save someone. \"If I get a kidney, it's fine. If I don't, I hope someone else does,\" the wife said. And that's why Larry is still out there, appealing to the  _  of strangers for the love of his wife.",
