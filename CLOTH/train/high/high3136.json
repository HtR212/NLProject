    "article": "A young man, a student in one of our universities, was one day taking a walk with a professor, who was commonly called the students' friend, for his kindness to those who waited on his instructions. As they went along, they saw  _  in the path a pair of old shoes, which they supposed to belong to a poor man who was employed in a field close by, and who had  _  finished his day's work. The student  turned to  the professor, saying, \"Let's play the man a(n)  _  : we will hide his shoes, and we stay behind those bushes, and wait to see his  _  when he cannot find them.\" \"My young friend,\" answered the professor, \"we should never  _  ourselves at the expense of the poor.You are  _  , and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of helping the poor man.Put a  _  into each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the  _  affects him.\" The student did so,  _  they both placed themselves behind the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came  _  the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes.While  putting on  his coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something  _  , he bent down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his face.He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again.He then looked around  _  on all sides, but no person was to be seen.He now put the money into his pocket, and went on to put on the other shoe; but his surprise was  _  on finding the other coin. His feelings  _  him; he fell upon his  _  , looked up to heaven and let out a sincere thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and  _  , and his children without bread, whom the timely giving, from some unknown hand, would save from dying. The student stood there deeply affected, his eyes filled with tears.\"Now,\" said the professor, \"Are you not much better pleased than if you had played your  _  trick?\" The youth replied, \"You have taught me a lesson which I will never forget.I feel now the  truth  of those words, which I never understood before: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'\"",
