    "article": "Have you ever heard the phrase, \"Love is blind\"? If so, you are already  _  with a type of mistake in our attempts to understand others: halo effects. This type of mistake  _  to the fact that once we form an overall impression of somebody, it could have strong effects on our  _  of his personality.  _  halo effects are both common and powerful. For example, most organizations contain one or more \"superstars\"--- people who have earned the reputation for being unusually  _  and capable. Once they have gained such a \"halo\", everything they do receives good  _  . Ideas that would be regarded as just so-so if suggested by someone else are seen as  _  when proposed by these persons. And actions that might be considered risky if taken by others are seen as brave when carried out by these \"chosen\" men and women.\nAs you can see, halo effects carry high costs. They may lead some persons to have an  _  high opinion of their own worth, while making things  _  for others who are equally deserving. Further, by giving too much influence to persons who are not ready to receive it, and by preventing hidden talent from being  _  , they can harm organizations as well as individuals. Clearly, then, it is important to recognize the existence and impact of halo effects; only then can their harmful effects be avoided.",
