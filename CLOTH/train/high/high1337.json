    "article": "Human growth is a process of experimentation, trial, and error eventually leading to wisdom. Each time you choose to trust yourself and take action, you can never quite be certain how the situation will   turn out  . \nSometimes you are victorious, and sometimes you become disappointed. The   _   experiments, however, are no less valuable than the experiments that finally prove successful; in fact, you   _   learn more from your \"failures\" than you do from your   _  . If you have made what you think to be a mistake or failed to live up to your own   _  , you will most likely put up a barrier between your essence   and the part of you that is the alleged   wrong-doer.\nHowever, viewing past actions as   _   implies guilt and blame, and it is not possible to learn anything meaning while you are engaged in blaming.   _  , forgiveness is required when you are severely judging yourself. Forgiveness is the act of erasing an   _   debt. There are four kinds of forgiveness.\nThe first is beginner forgiveness for yourself.\nThe second of forgiveness is beginner forgiveness for another.\nThe third kind of forgiveness is   _   forgiveness of yourself. This is for serious misbehaviors, the ones you carry with deep   _  . When you do something that violates your own values and principles, you create a gap between your standards and your actual   _  .\nIn such a case, you need to work very hard at   _   yourself for these deeds so that you can close this gap. This does not   _  that you should rush to forgive yourself or shouldn't feel regret,   _   taking pleasure in these feelings for a prolonged period of time is not healthy. \nThe   _  and perhaps most difficult one is the advanced forgiveness of another.\nAt some time of our life, you may have been severely wronged or hurt by another person to such a degree that forgiveness seems   _  .\nHowever, harboring anger and revenge  fantasies only keeps you 57 _  in victimhood . Under such a circumstance, you should force yourself to see the bigger picture. By doing so, you will be able to   _   the focus away from the anger and resentment .\nIt is only through forgiveness that you can erase wrongdoing and   _   the memory. When you can   _   release the situation, you may come to see it as a necessary part of your growth.",
