Most gypsy children had a  _  look\nin their eyes.\n     They were hardened by the world and by  _  they had experienced. The gypsies  _  in slums  . The children begged on the streets or did other work so that their parents could  _  to buy wine. Every time we saw these  _  , we could always see the\ndead look in their eyes. But not this  _  . She was cheerful and had a\nbeautiful smile on her face. As soon as she  sat down  , she started talking to\nus. Her name was Angela and she was on her  _  to visit her grandfather\nin a nearby slum village. I  _  my purse for something nice to give her.  _  , all I had with me was gum. She eagerly put a  _  in her mouth, and\nthen squinted   her eyes because the  _  was mint-flavored  . It seemed like she had  _  tasted it before. She  _  in a funny way\nand the other people on the bus were all amused by what she did. When the bus  pulled  in  , she picked up the big bag she was carrying,  _  and jumped out\nof the bus.\n    She is out of my life, but not out of my  _  . This girl deserved so much more than her  _  surroundings, yet\nshe didn't let any of them get herself  _  . I pray I will  _  her\nagain someday, so that I can give her that hug which I should have given her\nthat day on the bus!",
