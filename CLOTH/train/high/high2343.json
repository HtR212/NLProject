    "article": "It happened on a Saturday afternoon about 12 years ago. I volunteered to take my daughter to the local  _  while my wife did the housework. As soon as we got there, my daughter rushed to the  _  and asked for a push. As I was helping my daughter to go higher and higher, I noticed  another little girl  trying to get her own swing going, but  _  . Her grandmother was sitting quietly on a nearby bench and took no notice of it at all.\nAfter giving my daughter a big  _  , I walked over to the little girl and asked if she needed a push too. She  _  and said \"Yes!\" I soon had her feet flying towards  the clouds  while she laughed happily. For the next two hours I  _  myself pushing swings and playing games with my daughter and the little girl on the playground. By the time we  _  home, I was physically exhausted, but my spirits were still  _  higher than those swings.\nOne day 2 years later, as usual, I needed to  pick up  my daughter from school before going home. I stood tiredly in the parents'  _   area watching for my kid.  _  , I felt two tiny arms going around my stomach. I  looked down  and there was the very little girl on the playground smiling up at me. She gave me one more big  _  before running off to catch her school bus. As I watched her  _  , I didn't feel so  _  any more and my  _  were once again up in the heavens.\nIn this life every single bit of  _  we share finds its way back to us again. It may travel from heart to heart or it may blossom in the soul  _  it was planted.",
