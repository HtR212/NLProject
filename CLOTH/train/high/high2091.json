When he found out that I was from  Chicago  , he told me he had a good friend who lived there and he wondered if, by any chance, I  _   to know him. At the moment I thought he might be joking, but I could    _   from the expression on his face that he was  _  . I felt like saying that it was impossible to all the millions of people in Chicago I could have  _  with his friend. But instead, I just  _  and told him that Chicago was a very big city. He   _  , and I thought he was going to  _  talking about the subject. But I was  _  . He was silent for a few minutes, and then he began to tell me about his friend.\nHe told me that his friend's main  _  in life seemed to be playing tennis. He said he was an excellent tennis player, and that he  _  had his own tennis court . He added that he knew a lot of people with swimming pools,  _   he only knew two people who had private tennis courts. I told him I knew several people having private tennis courts, including my brother who was a doctor in California---and, in fact,  _  my next door neighbor in Chicago. He said that maybe there were  _  private courts in the country than he realized, but he did not know of any others. Then he asked me where my brother lived in California. When I said Sacramento, he said that was a coincidence   _  his friend spent the summer in Sacramento last year, and he stayed next door to a doctor who had a tennis court in his backyard. I said I felt that really was a coincidence because my  next-door neighbor  had gone to Sacramento last summer and had rented   the house   next to  my brother's. For a moment, we  _  at each other, but we did not say anything.\n\"Would your friend's name happened to be Roland Dickwood?\" I asked finally. He laughed and said, \"Yes. Would your  _  name happened to be Dr Ray Hunter?\" It was my  _  to laugh. \"Yes, \"I replied.",
