A bout 18 months ago, my father was in hospital recovering from a major lung operation. My mother had recently  passed away  , and my father had taken the loss of his partner of 55 years very hard and had lost interest in  _  . Trying to get him to  _  each day was quite a chore as he didn't want anything. The one thing,  _  , that he would ask us to bring him was ice-cream.
