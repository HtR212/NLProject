Fill in each blank with the word or phrase that best fits the context.\nIt's been so long that I can't remember the crime, but I'll never forget the punishment: Dig up the fig tree   in the backyard and plant it at Mumsy's place in the country. As I often did when appointed to do a hard job in the garden, I  _  this was my parents' way of getting me to do their dirty work.\nIt was a Sunday morning. With some tools, I went at the tree, dismantling   it branch by branch and limb by limb, until all that remained of the once-proud specimen was a sorry-looking stump of a thing.\n\"What did that  _  ever do to you?\", my father said, \"You left some taproot  , at least. Go and load up the truck.\" On any other day before, during the  _  to mumsy's, we would have pleasantly  talked about  school as usual, but I fenced myself off that time.\nThen, at Mumsy's, instead of sitting back to watch me work, he  _  me. As my father and I took turns to work, I could feel my anger  _  , making room for the simple satisfaction of working at my father's side towards a common goal.\n\" Well,\" my father said when we finished, \" we've done what we can do.\" \"Do you think there's any  _  that it can grow up?\" I asked. \"It's rich dirt. They say you can plant toenails in it and grow little kids.\" My father answered. I never tried the toenail trick, but I did watch as it settled in, took root, and began to prosper. I was amazed and  _  when bowls of figs began to fill the fridge.\nIn a  _  fair world, I don't deserve the reward. I had hurt the tree for my own complaints. What right did I have to the fruit? Years later, I put this  _  to my father. Watching him slide a bowl of figs from the fridge one morning, I felt a sudden stab of shame for my boyhood  _  . My father took a fig from the bowl and let me think of the fruit as forgiveness. \"You,\" he said, \"  _  some of that.\"",
