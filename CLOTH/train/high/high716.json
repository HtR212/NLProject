    "article": "It was autumn. A thin white moon rose over the valley. Peter, 11 years old, did not see it. He did not feel the cool wind   _   his face, for his thoughts   were fixed   on a red and black   _   on the table, which was a   _   from his father to his grandfather. They said that Grandpa was    going away  .\n  Peter had   not really   believed Father would send Grandpa away. Now, there was the thing Father had bought   _   very morning. This was the last evening he and Grandpa would have with each other. After washing the   _   dishes, the old man took up the blanket. \"What a   _   double blanket! I'll not feel cold with it,\" said the old man,   _   it over his knees.\n  \"Oh, yes!\" Peter said and tried to   _   back the tears in his eyes.\n  Just then   in   came two people, Father and the girl he was to   _  . The girl went up to Grandpa and said Prettily, \"I'll not be   _   you in the morning, so I came over to say good-bye.\"\n  \"It's nice of you,\" said Grandpa. \"Will you look at this? Isn't it a fine blanket my son has given me to go away with?\"\n  \"Yes, really,\" she said, She felt it and said   _  , \"A double one! It must have cost much.. He doesn't need a double one.\"\n  \"She is   _  , Father,\" the boy said, \"Here, Father.\" He held out a   _   of scissors . \"Cut the blanket into   _  . A single one is enough for an old man. We'll   _   the other half.\"\n  \"What do you   _   by that?\" asked Father.\n  \"I'll give it to you when you are old and I'm sending you away.\" said the boy slowly.",
