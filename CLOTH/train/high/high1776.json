Then he became my friend.  In time  , I felt he was also my father. Leo married my mother when I was eleven. Two years later we moved into a house in a new suburban development, where we put down roots. At first our lawn was just a mud with wild grass, but Leo saw bright  _  . \"We'll plant trees there to give us  _  as well as some flowers,\" he said. And just these little touches made our house  _  from all the others. More importantly, a real family was  _  . Leo was becoming a full-time parent, and I was learning what it  _  to have a father.
