He has called from his   _  to say that he is on the way home.\nHis wife is preparing  _  . He can see light shining inside\nhis own front door. He looks forward to  fire  and hot milk. But\na few seconds later, he  is lying  on the icy ground in a  _  of his own blood .\n         It doesn't happen very often, but it   _  happen in the capital city of\nthe United States. It is likely to happen in the near-deserted city center  at night  . What happened to him could happen to  _  of us.\n         Dr. Smith,    _  is 71, got out of his white car at 7:40 p.m.\noutside his home  _  No 345, Cumberland Street. Two youths\nsaid, \"Get out!  _  , please!\"  He  _  the\norder. He handed over his wallet  _  several cards, a gold\nwatch and the only money he had in his pockets----twenty-five cents. The youths\nalso said, \"Now we're going to  _  you anyway.\"\nAnyway they  _  . One bullet hit him in the leg and struck the\nbone. The other entered his chest  just below the upper pocket of his suit. It   _  missed\nhis heart.\n         Strangely he   made it  across a ten-meter distance, up eight steps and along\ntwenty more feet of stone path. His  _  met him at the door,\nand saw two men running. Dr. Smith told her to call the police and the doctor.\n  Dr. Smith is a powerful political figure, but it is not   _  that the two young men knew who he was. More likely the reason for\nthe killing was that he had  no more than  a quarter of dollar--not enough for two\ncups of coffee.",
