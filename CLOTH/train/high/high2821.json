We were extremely   _  , perhaps because we were sleep-walking. And we were all ready when the taxi came to   _   us 45 minutes later.\nIt was a quiet   _   to the airport. We didn't even chat, because he was enjoying his new iPod. At the airport, the taxi   pulled in   to let us get off, at which point the iPod guy   turned to   me and said, \"We don't have our   suitcase  .\"\n\"You are   _  , right?\" I replied, for he   _   lied like that.\n\"No. I mean it. Did you bring it down? I didn't .\"\n\"What do you mean; you didn't?\" I shouted. \"All our things are there.\"\n\" How   _  !\" I was thinking, \"You're always   _   to do things like bringing down luggage. This is your fault,   _   now, we may   _   our flight.\" I didn't  say that out loud,   though  . He already knew how I felt.\nThe experience showed I had a hard time accepting   _  . But what do you think of me? Psychologists think that the best way to assess ourselves is   _   the eyes of others. We often don't recognize that we've done wrong.\nOh, and that missing suitcase? We went home   _   in the taxi, picked it up, returned to the airport and made it through with minutes to   _  .\nLater, while walking along Broadway, I noted how   _   I was. I hadn't said a thing about his forgetting our suitcase at home.",
