The spider wasn't trying to be something else, like a butterfly or a bee, Marissa thought. It was happy to be exactly what it was and to do what it was good at.\nWhat came naturally to Marissa was  _  . She could paint or draw all day long and never get bored. However, a few weeks ago Marissa signed  _  for high jump. Because her mother had been a high jump star in school, she thought it would make her mother happy. But now she  _  that however hard she worked, she would never be a high jump star like her mother.\nOne night, halfway through her homework, Marissa fell  _  .When she woke up, the clock   _  1:00 A.M. Marissa got into a panic. There was still so much  _  to do, but she really needed her rest for track  practice. Marissa had always been a good student, but now track was risking her  _  .\nThen a dark thought   _   Marissa's mind. If she  _  some of her classes, she would be off the track team. That was one way to solve her problem.\nAfter a week of  _  her homework, letters had been mailed out to parents listing grades, and Marissa knew the letters would show that her grades had  _  a lot. She walked home with slow heavy steps, knowing her  _  plan had   _  .\nJust as Marissa had expected, her mother was waiting with the letter in her hand. \"What's happening to your grades?

I hated it,  _  I didn't want to disappoint you. I thought if I were failing in my classes, Coach would kick me off the team. What a  _  I've made of everything.\"\nMarissa watched her mother's face turn from anger to  _  . \"Marissa, I was always proud of you. You didn't need to do the high jump to make me happy. Now you have a lot of hard work in front of you because you made a bad  _  .\"\nMarissa thought again about the spider. She realized she had lost sight of her  _  and twisted her web. Now she had to go back and  _  that web.",
