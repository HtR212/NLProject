    "article": "When I was about 6 years old I lived in Kenya. There was a lot of   _   and there were always street children on the roads asking for money. There was such a big   _   between those children and me, for I grew up very aware of being so fortunate.\n   We had a   _   and very kind driver, John, who had been working with my family for decades. He would   _   us to and from school. One day we had to take a detour  on the way to school and while we were25 _  in traffic by a young street child, probably no more than 10 years old, he   called out  with a friendly greeting, \"Hi, John!\"\n   He approached the   _   and shook John's hand. John then gave him a little bit of money and waved him off with a(n)   _   before we carried on our way to school.\n   I had watched the whole incident from the back seat,    _   surprised. I knew that John worked very hard to make ends meet. He had a   _   family himself. We were always sending rice and fruit and other snacks and clothes for his 31 _  and I knew that he didn't have any spare money. So, of course, at the age I couldn't 32 _  why he would be giving money to the child.\n   \"Who was he?\" I asked, \"My friend,\" he replied, \"I 33 _  him every morning on my way to work and I give him a little bit of money.\" Still   _   to comprehend, I asked, \"Why do you have to give him money every morning?\" John replied, \"So he can use it to35 _  some food.\" It was probably in that moment that I understood what   _   really was.\nSomeone who was in a difficult   _   themselves still found some money to spare for a child who need it. And that had such a great   _   on me. I couldn't get it out of my head.\nEvery Friday we would have  _   at my grandparents' house and, after dinner, my grandfather would give us some pocket money. I would 40 _  mine up so I could give it to John to give to his friend.",
