    "article": "Perhaps the only test score that I remember is the 41. I was in high school. The test was the final for the class. It was a rather  _  test. I didn't know how  _  I had done but I knew there were things on  _  that I didn't know. I remember  _  waiting for the result. When Mr. Bales  _  my paper on my desk, I was  _  . There in big  _  numbers, circled to draw attention, was my grade -- 41! I  _  my paper so that others couldn't see it. A 41 was not  _  that you wanted your classmates to see. Finally, Mr. Bales stood behind the desk and  _  the class. \"The grades were not very good;  _  of you passed,\" he announced. \" The highest grade in the class was a 41, so all of you failed.\" A 41. That was me. Suddenly my dismal face didn't look quite so bad. I had the highest grade. I felt a lot  _  . As soon as I got home, my mother asked me, \"How did you do on your test?\" \"I made a 41,\" I said. My mother's  _  changed suddenly. \"You failed.\" \"But I had the highest grade in the class!\" I replied. \" I don't  _  what everyone else had. You failed. It doesn't matter if everyone else failed too; what matters is what you do,\" my mother  _  answered. For years, I thought that was a harsh judgment. My mother was always that  _  . It didn't matter what the other kids did; it only mattered what I did and  _  I did it excellently. We often don't understand the wisdom of good parents until we ourselves stand  _  the parenting shoes. My mother's philosophy has  _  me throughout life. The path of the crowd is wide but the path to pass the tests of life is  _  and there are very few people on it.",
