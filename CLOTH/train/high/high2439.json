Too many people think that pollution  _  be stopped if we want the economy to continue developing. But that is ridiculous . We can33 _ waste from factories if we are smart about what we buy. I want to teach people to buy recycled products. The production of recycled things is much  _  for the environment, because it means we do not need to cut down more trees and cause the destruction of more forests. The population will still grow,  _  Earth will not have to suffer. We should also pay attention36 _ what we eat. People should take responsibility for not buying certain kinds of fish, because there are not many left in the  _  .\nWe also have  _  problem with industry. The number of people in the world   keeps  growing, and we are producing more rubbish. What if we run out of space? If we all work together, we can solve these problems and keep our  _  clean and healthy.",
