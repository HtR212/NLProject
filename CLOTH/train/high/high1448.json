    "article": "My dad, \"Mutt\" Mantle is  more than  a father to me, sometimes more like a good judge of talent--\"A\"\nHe was  _  about baseball. He made his living working in mines. But he played baseball in several town teams.\nFrom the day I was born, Dad said he wanted me to make my living as baseball player. He named me Mickey  _  a catcher he liked. He hoped I would play for the New York Yankees.\nDad often  _  a toy baseball to my crib . One day,  by chance  . I caught one. Then he was sure that I'd be a ball player!\nI learned about the  _  on a ball field before I learned my ABC's. When I was three, Dad had Mama make me little uniform. He liked to  show me off  around town in it.\nWhen I five, I started school. That same day, I had my first  _  in switch-hitting \nDad and Grandpa were in the yard when I came home from school. They had a small bat and two  tennis balls  \"Mickey,\" said Dad, \" Grandpa and I have thought up at a new  _  . Take this bat and try to hit our\npitches .I'm left-handed. When I throw, you swing right-handed  _  you always have. Grandpa's right-handed. When he throws, turn around and swing left-handed.\"\nDad was going to make me a  switch-hitter  ! He knew that a player who can bat both right and left has a good  _  of making hit.\nThat day I tried and tried. But I couldn't swing left-handed. After about 15 minutes, I yelled to Mama for help. She said, \" I know it's easy. But please try.  _  to make Dad happy.\"\nSo, every day after school we had switch-hitting  _  . After two weeks, I didn't  _  it any more. My  _  were getting trained. I began to hit a few.\nAfter a year or two, Dad and Grandpa began throwing as  _  as they could. And they put real curves on those tennis balls. Then as I grew older, they began to use baseball  _  \nSo you know  _  I, today's baseball star Mickey Mantle, got my star as a Switch-Hitter.",
