On a family car trip, her Aunt Dede pulled out a copy of Harry Potter, as a surprise for her   _  . But Lainey took one look at it,   _  her eyes, and said, \"Borring!\"\nAunt Dede, a teacher, had read the book to her students, and they loved it.   _  the youngest children in the class were   _  by the story. They  _   with great interest and then   _   joined in grand conversations about Harry`s adventures.\n\"How can you say it`s   _  ? Have you read it? \" asked Aunt Dede.\n\"No, it`s too long and it doesn`t have any  _  .\" complained Lainey.\n\"Oh, that`s where you are   _  ;there are lots of pictures. Every page is full of pictures; you just have to read the words to   _  them. It`s like magic.\"\n\"Nice try , Aunt Dede,\"Lainey replied   _  from the back seat.\nAnother  _   was in order. \"Well, if you don't want to read it, give it   _  .Maybe your mom would   _   hearing the story.\" The book sailed through the air to Aunt Dede and she began to read it aloud. By the end of the first chapter,   _  were coming from the back seat:\"Please read a little  louder  .\"\nLainey is an example of an  _  reader. As shown here, Lainey can become   _   about reading when   _   with literature on topics that interest her, and when the people around her model involvement in the reading process.",
