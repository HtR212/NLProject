From there, the couple,  in panic  , were forced to  _  for 24 hours on the floor of a shopping centre with 2500 others. \"Trees were being  knocked over  and big branches were scattered across the streets,\" Stefan told Sweden's Expressen newspaper. \"We  _  escaped\" The couple then flew to Christchurch, New Zealand.  _  their arriving, a massive earthquake  measuring  magnitude 6.3 hit the city on February 22. Erika said \"We could not visit the city since it was completely in  _  , so instead we travelled around before going to Japan.\" But days after the Svanstroms arrived, Tokyo was  _  by Japan's largest earthquake  _  records began. \"The trembling was horrible and we saw roof debris fly off the buildings,\" Mr. Svantrom said. \"  _  seemed the buildings were swaying  back and forth  .\" The family returned to Sweden on March 29 after a(n)  _  calmer visit to their last destination China.
