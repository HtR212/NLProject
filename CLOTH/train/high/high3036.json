    "article": "If you are a modern art lover, you should be sure to drop by the Saatchi Gallery during your visit to London. The original gallery was  _  by Charles Saatchi, a British art collector  _  for founding the Saatchi and Saatchi advertising agency with his brother. It moved from its old  _  in St. John's Wood to its new home in County Hall near the Thames in the spring of 2003. Anyone who has heard  _  in the past of the often shocking but always inspiring works on  _  at the Saatchi Gallery will not be  _  when visiting the gallery's new location. Along with the  _  of new British artists, the gallery still  _  the works of Damien Hirst, the Chapman brothers, and Tracy Emin in its permanent  _  . Of the artworks, one can see in the Saatchi Gallery, Hirst's works are probably the most  _  . Hirst's work first made headlines in the early 1990s when he  _  art from dead animals. Along with Hirst, the Chapman brothers, Dinos and Jake, also  _  a certain amount of their fame to the Saatchi Gallery. It was through Saatchi  _  these two brothers came to public attention. At the gallery, visitors can see the brothers' vision of Hell, made from 30, 000 plastic toy soldiers. Another artist featured at the gallery who has grabbed  _  with her art is Tracy Emin. In 1998, Emin gave  _  to argument when she sold her messy, unmade bed to Saatchi as a work of art  _  My Bed at PS150, 000. Are any of these works really art? That is a question you will have to answer for  _  when you visit the Saatchi Gallery. Charles Saatchi himself says, \"I don't have any ground rules for  _  art. Sometimes you look and don't feel very  _  with it--but that doesn't tell you very much. It doesn't  _  reveal much about the quality of the work.\"",
