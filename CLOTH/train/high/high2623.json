Somehow a  _  had overheard my saying that I had to go to another  _  . As I passed her table, she  _  me a card with her phone number on it. She explained that she lived in Sydney and that I should call  _  I needed any help. Some weeks later, it was time for  _  appointment in Sydney and I flew there. I was  _  as I had never been there before and didn't  _  anyone else there. So I  _  to ring the lady who had given me her  _  number, even though I had only met her that once.  _  I had arrived, she was very excited and came  _  to meet me. She gave me a bed and a meal and took me to my appointment the next day and afterwards, she took me back to the  _  . She treated me so  _  that I offered her a gift to express my  _  but she refused. She said \"Your  _  to me is to offer your help to another when it is  _  .\" Over the months we kept in touch but then for some reason our communication got less and less  _  . I always felt I wasn't giving enough to others as a  _  , but she had told me that I gave her very much and the way I  treated  people was a gift. I now give a hand to others every day even if it is only a smile to those who have none to give.",
