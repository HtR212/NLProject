It is a 41 _  of what has happened in the past, and the really interesting thing is that much of history has been 42 _  time and again. It allows us to learn from the past, both the 43 _  made and the successes achieved.\nOne of the 44 _  of history is that it allows us to know how famous people 45 _  when they were faced with challenges in their life. 46 _  these challenges happened at a certain time in the past or in a 47 _  country or culture, all of them can always teach us something 48 _ .\nTake for example the 49 _  of Thomas Edison and how many times he 50 _  while on the road to finally inventing the light bulb  . He could be held out as an example of a person who 51 _  stopped trying. I am sure he was 52 _  by those difficulties but he did not let them stop him. He had a 53 _  and he just kept trying until he reached success.\nOr, think about the story of Abraham Lincoln who 54 _  to become President of the United States even though he suffered 55 _  losses. Most of us only know about his success. 56 In fact , his life was not an easy one. His story makes us keep moving forward no matter what 57 _  we have in life.\nThese true history stories will make you stop to reconsider 58 giving up  or food for thought about going after your dreams even though you may not think you have the courage or the 59 _  for now to get what you have always wanted. They could help you make decisions and 60 _  when you have no idea what to do. They could inspire you to be all that you can be.",
