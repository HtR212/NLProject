    "article": "The purpose of a letter of application is to help you to \"sell\" yourself. It should state  _  the job you want, and should tell what your abilities are and what you have  _  . It should be simple, human, personal and brief without  _  out any necessary facts. In writing a letter of application, keep in  _  that things a possible employer is most  _  to want to know about are your qualification, your achievements and your aims. The opening paragraph is perhaps the most important part.  _  the first few sentences fail to  _  the readers' attention, the rest of the letter may not be  _  at all. Try to key your opening remarks to the needs or interests of the employer, not  _  your own needs or desires. For example, instead of beginning with \"I saw your  _  in today's newspaper\". You might say , \"I have made a careful  _  of your advertising during the past six months\" or \" I have made a survey in my neighborhood to find out how many housewives  _  your product and why they like it\". Try to  _  generalities . Be clear about the kind of job for which you are now  _  . College graduates looking for their first positions often ask \"What can I  _  ?\" in a letter. Employers want experience---which, naturally, no  _  has. The answer is that everything you have ever done is  _  . It is important to write a good strong closing remark for your letter.  _  a specific request for an interview or give the possible employer something definite to do or expect. An excellent  _  is to enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope with your letter. That makes it  _  for a possible employer to get in touch with you.",
