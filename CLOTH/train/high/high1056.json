One day, I was walking to a  _  to get some food when I noticed a little man  _  on a bench beside the store. I walked past him but could not  _  thinking about him. So I  _  around and went up to him and asked him if he was  _  . He said no. He said he hadn't  _  for two days. I told him, \"Don't  _  . I'll be right back.\" Before leaving, I  _  him what he would like to eat. He said it didn't  _  . Then I asked him to tell me what he hadn't had for a long  _  . He said \"a Pepsi\". I went into the store and got him some bread, lunch meat, chips, cookies --  _  food for a few days. The store didn't have Pepsi,  _  I had to go to another one. I used the  _  of what I had to get him a Pepsi from a store far  _  . After a long time, when I brought him the  _  and the Pepsi, he cried. With  _  in his eyes, he said, \"You are my angel.\" When he  stood up  to hug me, I had a strange  _  -- he was my angel, too. I couldn't even  _  the feeling clearly. Maybe because he gave me a / an  _  to help him, which helped me to understand that I also had abilities to help others.",
