Pete was being  _  in spring training the year he was about to break Ty Cobb's all-time hits record. Suddenly one reporter asked him, \"Pete, you only need 78 hits to reach your nearest  _  . How many at-bats do you think it'll take you to get the 78 hits?\" Without hesitation, Pete just  _  at the reporter and said,\"78.\" The reporter yelled back, \"Ah, come on, Pete, you don't think you'll get 78 hits in 78 at-bats, do you?\" Mr. Rose calmly  _  his philosophy(,) with the reporters who were  _  waiting for his reply to the claim. \"Every time I  _  up to the plate ,I  _  to get a hit!  _  I have it in mind,I have no right to step into the batter's box! It is  _  expectation that has enabled me to get all of the hits in the first place.\" When I thought about Pete Rose's  _  and how it applied to everyday  _  ,I felt a little embarrassed. As a business person,I was hoping to increase my  _  . As a father,l was hoping to be a good dad. As a married man,I was hoping to be a good husband. The truth was that I was a fairly good salesperson,I was not so  _  a father,and I was an okay husband. I immediately decided that being okay was not  _  ! I wanted to be a great salesperson,a great father and a great husband. I  _  my attitude to a positive one,and the results were  _  .I was fortunate enough to win a few sales trips,I won Coach of the Year in my  _  baseball league,and I share a loving relationship with my wife,Karen,with whom I am  _  to enjoy the rest of my life!  Thanks  ,Mr. Rose!",
