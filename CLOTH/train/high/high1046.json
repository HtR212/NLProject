    "article": "One day a teacher asked her students to list the names of  the other  students in the classroom on two sheets of paper, leaving a space between each name. Then she told them to think of the  _  thing they could say about each of their classmates and write it down. It  _  the class some time to finish their assignment, and as the students left the room, each one  handed in  the papers. That Saturday, the teacher wrote down the  _  of each student on a separate sheet of paper and  _  what everyone else had said about that individual. On Monday she gave each student his or her list. Before long, the whole class was  _  . \"Really?\" she heard whispered. \"I never knew that I  _  anything to anyone!\" and, \"I didn't know others liked me so much\" were most of the comments. No one ever  _  those papers in class again. She never knew if they discussed them after class or with their parents, but it didn't  _  . The exercise had completed its  _  . The students were  _  with themselves and one another. That group of students moved on. Several years later, one of the students was  _  in Vietnam War and his teacher  _  the funeral of that special student. After the funeral, most of Mark's former classmates left. Mark's mother and father were there, obviously waiting to speak to his teacher. \"We want to  _  you something,\" his father said, taking a  _  out of his pocket. \"They found this on Mark when he was killed. We thought you might  _  it.\" Opening the wallet, he  _  removed two worn pieces of notebook paper that had obviously been taped, folded, and refolded many times. The teacher knew without  _  that the papers were the ones on which she had listed all the good things each of Mark's classmates had said about him. \"Thank you so much for doing that,\" Mark's mother said. \"As you can see, Mark  _  it.\"",
