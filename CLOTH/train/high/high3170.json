    "article": "Historians already know that Winston Churchill often took high-risk gambles in his political life . But that Churchill was a gambler in   other   aspects of his life has tended not to catch his biographers'   _   .\nTwo new books attempt to fill this   _   .\nThe first is No More Champagne written by David Lough , a private-banker-turned-historian who looks at Churchill's personal   _   during the ups and downs of his career . It is the first   _   to focus on this aspect of his life .\nMr. Lough has   _   through Churchill's personal accounts and found that he was as much a   _   when it came to his money as he was when he was   making decisions   at the Admiralty or in Downing Street .\n  _   Churchill was a descendant of the Dukes of Marlborough , his   _   had \" very little money on either side \" - but that never   _   them living the   _   life . Indeed , between 1908 and 1914 the Churchill household spent an average of PS1,160 on wine   _   each year--$145,000 in today's money . It is no   _   that Churchill spent most of his life leaping from one cash flow crisis to another , being constantly behind his suppliers'   _   .\nAnother new book , Winston Churchill Reporting , by Simon Read , an American journalist , looks at one of the   _   Churchill eventually paid some of them :   _   .\nMr. Read investigates how Churchill went from a young army officer to being Britain's highest-earning war journalist by the age of 25 .\nThe Churchill name   _   helped open newspaper editors' doors across London . But it was that the young   _   was willing to take risks on   _   across the world that marked out his columns from those of his contemporaries .",
