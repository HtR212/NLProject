    "article": "Growing up in my Grandma's house as a boy was an experience that would shape me for the rest of my life. We were poor in everything but  _  . yet I learned so much about life there. My Mom, Dad, Grandma, two  _  , and I were all  _  into a home made from two old shabby cars. I always knew what my next  _  would look like because I had seen my older brother  _  them the year before, I always knew what we were going to be  _  in winter, because I had  _  it in the garden during the summer.  _  , I never felt poor. No king ever ate as good as we did on Sundays after church when Grandma  _  her homemade meatballs, spaghetti and freshly baked bread.  _  we had so little I can still remember Dad, Mom, and Grandma giving so much. We were always  _  with others. Everyone who  _  our family could expect a  _  of spaghetti, or a jar of vegetables, or a flower pot full of fresh flowers. I can still remember my parents' eyes  _  whenever they passed something on to others. We never felt  _  than when we shared what we were given. I learned early that the greatest joy comes from giving  rather than  getting. Giving makes your spirit greater. Don't be afraid to  pass on  what you have to others. Share everything you have. If you have a beautiful  _  , then smile at whoever you come across. If you have a few extra dollars, then give them to the people in need. If you have a  _  talent, then share it with others. If you have a heart full of love, then give it to everyone. No life ever truly lives  _  it becomes a gift, so make your whole life a gift to the world.",
