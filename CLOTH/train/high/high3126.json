We moved into our house this June. Shortly thereafter,37 _ we were away at Peace Corps training, the owner ripped out  all the surrounding banana groves to raise the ground level -- she had planned on38 tearing down our house and building a new one after we left.\nShe brought in tons of dirt. This39 _ our house in a kind of moat , and when the heavy rain came, our house40 _ . This, needless to say, was upsetting, but it turned into a41 _ , because when the principal at my school became42 _ of it, he got my eighth-grade class to come to help clean up. The boys43 _ into the moat to drain  the water, while the girls mopped up the water44 _ , spread newspapers to45 _ it and cleaned up. Before the46 _ was truly solved, however, we had another flood. This turned into a party, with teachers and students47 _ helping clean up, and our host mother bringing lunch for everyone.\nAnother time, my husband suddenly got very48 _ -- a rather small infection in his leg49 _ , and he was in a state of shock. It was going to take the ambulance two hours to reach our house, but my co-teacher50 _ arranged for a truck to take us to meet it -- this truly saved his life by cutting two hours off the51 _ .\nThere were countless other less dramatic52 _ of care and generosity.
