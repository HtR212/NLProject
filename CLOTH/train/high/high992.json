As children grow, they get more  _  to make their own choices. Teenagers choose their own forms of entertainment, as well as the friends to  share  them with. When they reach young adulthood, they  _  their own jobs and marriage partners. Of course, many young adults  _  seek their parents' advice and approval for the choice they make.
