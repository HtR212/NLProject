One day the child asked God, \"They tell me you are going to send me to the   _  tomorrow but how am I going to   _  there being so small and helpless?\" God replied. \"Among the many   _     , I have chosen one for you. She will be waiting for you and will take care of you.\" \n\"But tell me, here in Heaven, I don't do   _   else but sing and smile. That's   _   I need to be happy!\" \n\"Your angel will sing for you and will also   _   for you every day. And you will feel your angel's love and be  _  .\"  \n\"And how am I going to be able to   _   when people talk to me, if I don't know the language they speak?\" \n\"That's easy,\" said God. \"Your angel will tell you the most beautiful words you will   _  hear, and with much patience and   _  , your angel will teach you how to   _  .\" \n\"I've heard on the earth there are    _   men. Who will protect me?\" \nGod put his arm   around  the child, saying, \"Your angel will   _   you, even if it means   _     her life!\" \n\"But I will always be sad   _  I will not see you any more.\" \nGod hugged the child, \"Your angel will   _  talk to you about me.\" \nAt that moment there was much peace in Heaven, but voices from the earth could already be     _  . The child knew he had to start on his   _  very soon, and he asked God one more question, \"Oh God, since I am about to leave now, please tell me my Angel's name!\" \nGod replied, \"Your angel's name is not   _  to remember. You will simply call her Mommy!\"",
