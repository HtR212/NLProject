    "article": "As a teenager, I always found my mother's Chinese English a shame. Her broken English often  led to  unfair treatment from others. It wasn't  _  for people to mistreat or sometimes ignore her.\nBeing fully  aware of  this limitation, she used to have me  _  to be her on the phone. I              had to ask for information or to yell at people, who had been rude to her.  _  ,I had to call her stockbroker  .In a teenager's voice,   _   was not very convincing, I said, \"This is Mrs. Lee\"\nStanding  _  me, my mother whispered loudly, \"Why he don't send me check already two week long?\"\nAnd then, in my  _  English I said, \"I'm getting  _  concerned. You agreed to send the check two weeks ago, but it50 hasn't arrived \"\nThen she talked  _  more loudly. \"What he want? I come to New York tell him front of his boss\"   _  I continued, \"I can't tolerate any more  _  .If I don't receive the check immediately. I'll have to speak to your manager when I'm in New York next week.\"\nThe next week we54 ended up in New York. My mother, the real Mrs. Lee, was shouting in her   _  English to his boss!              \nWell,how, I  _  my mother's English,  as  I hear it, is clear, vivid, direct, perfectly natural and full of observation and  _  . It is the language that has helped to shape the  _  I see things, express ideas, and  _  the world.",
