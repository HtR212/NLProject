Then we went  _  our way after saying goodbye.\nBut at     _  , a different\nstory is told. How we treat our loved ones, young and old. Later in the\nkitchen, as I  _  the meal, my\ndaughter walked up to me, very still. When I turned, I  _  knocked her down. \"Get out of the way!\" I shouted with a frown  . She stepped away silently, with her little heart   _  . I\ndidn't realize how rudely I had spoken.\nThat night, when I lay   _  in bed, God's\nquiet voice spoke to me and said, \"While  _  with a stranger, you are calm and polite, but with those you love,\nyou are quick to excite.  Go to look around on the kitchen floor, you'll\nfind some flowers there by the  _  .\nThose are the flowers she brought for you. She  _  them herself -- pink, yellow, and your favorite blue. She stood\nthere quietly and you never saw the  _  in\nher eyes.\"\nBy this time, I felt sad and small and now my own tears began to fall. I quietly went and knelt   by her   _  . \"Wake up, my dear,\" I said.\n\"Are these the flowers you picked up for me?\" She smiled, \"I found them out by\nthe tree, I  _  them\nin a napkin , just for you. I knew you'd like them, especially the     _  .\" I said, \"I am so sorry that I missed them today. And I  _  have fussed   at you that way. \"\nAnd she whispered, \"Mommy, that's OK... I still love you     _  .\" I hugged her and said, \"I love you, too and I love the flowers.\"\nDo you know that: if you die tomorrow, the   _  you\nare working for could easily replace you in a matter of days. But the family\nyou leave  _  will feel the loss for the\nrest of their lives. And come to think of it, we pour ourselves more into our  _  than into our families--- an unwise investment   indeed.\nRemember that   _  = (F)ATHER + (A)ND + (M)OTHER + (I ) + (L)OVE\n+ (Y)OU.",
