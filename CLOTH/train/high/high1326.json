    "article": "One day Anderson, who then looked poor and hungry, saw an old lady who obviously needed help. So he  _  up in front of her Benz car and got out.\nHe went down under her car and fixed everything soon. But he had to get  _  and his hands hurt. The old lady told him she couldn't  _  him enough for coming to her aid. She asked how much she owed him. Any  _  would have been all right with her. However, Anderson told her that  _  she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the  _  they needed.\nAnderson waited until the old lady drove off. A few miles down the road the lady saw a small  _  . She went in to get something to eat. The waitress gave her a warm welcome and brought a clean  _  to wipe her wet hair. The lady noticed the waitress was obviously pregnant , but she  _  let the aches change her  _   . The old lady wondered how someone like this could be so giving to a stranger. Then she remembered Anderson.\nAfter the  _  , she paid with a hundred dollar bill. The waitress quickly went to get the  _  but the old lady was gone by the time the waitress  came back  . The waitress then noticed something written on the napkin : \"You don't  _  me anything. I have been  _  too. Somebody once helped me out, the way I'm helping you. If you really want to pay me back, here is what you do: Do not let this chain of love  _  with you.\" Under the  _  were four more $100 bills.\nLater that night when the waitress was  in bed  , she was thinking about the money and what the lady had written. How could the lady have known how much she and her husband needed it? With the baby due next month and a small income, it was going to be  _  ...\nShe knew how  _  her husband was, and as he lay sleeping next to her, she gave her husband a soft kiss, \"Everything's going to be all right. I love you, Anderson.\"",
