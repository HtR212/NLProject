    "article": "I know little about my grandmother. We are   _   by 5,000 miles, and there is a   _  barrier; I wish I could speak the dialect .\nAt the age of 75, she   _   picked nuts in Hawaii. It is   _   work. The nuts are gathered from the   _   after they fall. To collect them, workers have to squat  to walk; it would be hard enough even without the Hawaiian sun. I asked my mom   _   my grandmother works even though she does not need the   _  . She explained that my grandmother enjoys the work and the feeling of   _   something.\nWith the money she saves from working, my grandmother will store supplies to bring to her     _   in the Philippines that has no electricity or running water. The people there are   _   to receive even the most   _   American goods. The children love the toys, and the favorite gifts for adults are towels. My grandmother usually   gives away   her own clothes, leaving Hawaii with many bags and boxes and   _   with only the clothes on her back.\nMost of what I know about my grandmother is from   _   my mom has told me. Even so, I think we're very alike. I have spent   _  days on a ladder building a roof for a family. When I finished this task, I felt the same   _   of achievement my grandmother has after she gathers her nuts.\nThis work helped me   _   the importance of her generosity . I learned from her that one person could have a great   _   on the world. Even though she's small in   _  , she's big in heart, bringing happiness and   _   to an entire village.",
