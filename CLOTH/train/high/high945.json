    "article": "A friend of mine had an accident   _  driving in darkness. His legs were   _  hurt that he couldn't move. What was the  _  was he found himself unable to ask for help------his mobile phone went out of  _  as a result of exhausted (,) battery. Nothing could be done but to   _   in cold wilderness. It was eight hours later that day broke, and then   _  of the rescue. \nIt is almost  _  that he could stand the horror in the darkness for so long. Even more surprising was his explanation:\"First of all I checked up my physical conditions and found myself not in mortal (  ) danger. As there was no   _  to call for help, I leaned back   in my seat trying my best to keep the wound from bleeding  .In this way I dozed off.\" ( , )\nHis story put an end to my regret for the   _  of an exploration adventure that happened last year. A group of young men managed to explore a mountain cave and got lost.   _  to find a way out in the dark cave they were frightened and ran anxiously without a sense of direction. Finally they feel dead in fear and exhaustion. According to the rescue people that found them, the place where they got lost was only about 10 meters away from the opening of the cave. If they stayed on the spot when they lost their way and tried to   _  themselves, they would probably sense   a faint  light glimmering not far away.\nDon't you think you can compare it with   _  itself? When you meet with difficulty   _   life and work, you are lost in darkness. Mind you it's unclear yet and you needn't put up struggle  _  . It seems to be a negative attitude,   _  a person who can afford to do so must have foresight as well as great courage in the first place.",
