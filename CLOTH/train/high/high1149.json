    "article": "My name is Nick Vujicic, an Australian who was born without any limbs . In recent years one of my most  _  videos on YouTube shows my skateboarding, surfing, playing music, and best of all,  _  hugs from all fields of great people. All in all, those are pretty ordinary  _  that just about anyone can do, right? So  _  do you think that video has been viewed millions of times? My theory is that people are  _  to watch it because in spite of my physical limitations, I'm living  as though  I had no limits. People often think someone  _  a severe disability to be inactive, upset, maybe even crazy. But I'd like to  _  them by showing that I lead a very adventurous and fruitful life Among the hundreds of  _  on that video, here's one typical remark:\"Seeing a guy like this being happy makes me wonder why I feel  _  for myself sometimes -or feel not funny enough, or whatever. How can I  _  think thoughts like that when this guy is living without limbs and still being happy!?\" I found happiness when I realized that imperfect  _  I may be, I am the perfect Nick Vujicic. I'm designed  according to  God's plan. That's not to say that there isn't  _  for improvement. I'm always trying to be better so I can better  _  the world! I do believe my life has no  _  . I want you all to feel the same way about your life, no matter what your challenges may be. As we  _  our journey together, please take a moment to  _  about any limitations you've placed on your life. Now think about what  _  would be like to be  _  of those limitations. What would your life be if anything were possible?",
