One can never fully  _  today while thinking too much about past successes, either. People never  _  while resting comfortably on their laurels . The  _  is that sometimes our successes hold us back more than our failures! I once  _  a story about the Oscar owner, actor Clark Gable. A friend  _  Gable one afternoon at the actor's home. She brought along her  _  son, who was playing happily with toy cars on the floor. He  _  he was racing those cars around a great track, which in  _  was an imaginary circle around a golden statue . The small statue the boy played with was actually the Oscar Clark Gable  _  for his performance in the 1934 movie It Happened One Night. When his mother told him the time had come to  _  ,the little boy asked the actor, \"Can I have this?\"  _  to the Oscar. \"Sure,\" he smiled. \"It's yours.\" The horrified mother  _  . \"Put that back immediately!\" Giving the child the golden statue, Clark Gable said, \"Having the Oscar around doesn't mean anything to me;  _  it does.\" The actor seemed to know that past success could be a  _  hammock upon which he may be tempted to  _  , rather than a springboard setting him to begin a new start. You may have learned to let go of past  _  and mistakes in order to free the present. But will you forget past successes and achievements in order to free the  _  ?Will your past be a springboard or a restful hammock? \"I like the  _  of the future better than the history of the past,\" said Thomas Jefferson. I  _  . After all, the future, not the past, is where the rest of your life will be lived.",
