    "article": "\"You can learn English more efficiently if you spend 20 minutes a day for a week than if you spend two hours a day.\" This is what a teacher usually says when he tells his students   how to  allot   their time. But is it true?\nSuppose you have a bucket   _  a small hole in its bottom. Now you are asked  to fill up  the bucket with the\nwater in a basin. If you are too little a boy to lift the basin  full of  water, you are sure  to make  use of a bowl or something alike. You will dip\nout  the water from the basin with the bowl and   _  it into the bucket. You may dip from the basin again and\nagain. However, you will soon  _  that as soon as you pour (;) a bowl of water into the bucket, most of the water leaks   out through the   _  , so you are  _  able to fill up the bucket this\nway.\nOn the contrary, if you are an adult, you will undoubtedly   _  the basin and pour the whole basin of\nwater into the bucket at once. Now, the bucket is full. Though the water in it\nis also leaking out, you at least have filled up the bucket with water. If you\nwant  to keep  the bucket full, you only  _  add a bowl of water now and\nthen.\nThe same is true of English learning. Let us   take  a simple example. If you learn 10 new words today,\nyou are most likely to remember nine  _  . But if you try to learn 30\nwords today, though you may forget  _  more than one word, you may still\nbe able to remember 11 or 12 words tomorrow.\nDay in and day   _  , you\nwill be able to remember a large number of words,  _  you may forget some\nof them.\nIn short, the more time you spend at a time, the more you will learn on the whole. Of course,   the amount of  time you spend each time must be  _  the limit that you do not exhaust     yourself  .",
