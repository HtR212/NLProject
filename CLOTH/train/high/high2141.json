    "article": "Our Future Homes What kinds of homes will we live  in in  the future? Nobody can be sure,  _  architects, and scientists are  working out  new ideas now. Some architects are thinking about  _  whole cities under huge glass domes. Of course, complicated heating and  _  systems will be necessary to control the climate in the domes.  Therefore  , there will never be any rain  _  snow, and the temperature will be always  _  . Perhaps everyone will live in vertical  _  . High rises are so large that they can contain all the necessities of life. Since vertical cities will use  _  land than horizontal cities, and provide homes for more people, they will be  _  for small countries that have  _  populations. Another idea that will be helpful to  _  countries (and island countries) is the  floating  city. Monaco has already built homes, stores, and offices  _  the water of the Mediterranean Sea. And a Japanese  _  has made a plan for constructing buildings on bridges over Tokyo Bay. There are some people who think we will go back to living in  _  . But the caves of the future will be quite  different from  the caves of the Stone Age. Computers will control light and climate. Farms and parks will be on the land  over  the cave city. When people want to go to the country or to a park, a short ride in  an elevator  will take them there.",
