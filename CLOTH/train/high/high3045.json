Her husband, Bill, stood nervous nearby as she was   _   to the hospital bed. While Connie was in the final   _   of her fight against cancer, she was   _  .\nConnie was a   _  . As we became acquainted , she confided   how   _   it was to be married 32 years to a man who often called her \"a silly woman\".\n\"I know Bill loves me. \"she said.\" But he has never been one to say he loves me, or send cards to me. I'd give anything if he'd say 'I love you', but it's just not in his   _  .\"\nSoon, when Connie had fewer   _   moments, I began spending more of my volunteer time with Bill.\nOne day, I got him on the   _  of women, how we need romance in our lives and how we love to got sentimental cards.\n\"I don't have to,\" he said. \"She knows I do!\"\n\"I'm sure she knows,\" I said, \"but she needs to hear what she has   _   to you all these years. Please think about it.\"\nTwo days later I walked down the hospice ward at noon. There stood Bill, leaning   _  the wall in the hallway and staring at the floor. I already knew Connie had   passed away   at 11 a.m.\nWhen I saw Bill. his face was wet with   _   and he was   _  .\nHe said, \"I have to say how good I feel about telling her. He stopped to   _   his nose. \"This morning I told her how much I loved her...and loved being married to her. You   _  have seen her smile!\"\nI went into the room to say goodbye to Connie. There, on the bedside table, was a large Valentine   _   from Bill,   _   : \"To my wonderful wife...I love you.\"",
