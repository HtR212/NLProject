An acquaintanceis someone whose name you know ,who you probably have something in   _   with and whoyou feel comfortable around.\nAcquaintances are people that you can invite into your home and share things with, but theyare people that you don't share your   _   with, and whose actions you sometimes don'tunderstand   _   you don't know enough about them.\nOn the other   hand   , friends are people you love. Not that you are \"in love\" with them, butyou care about them and you think about them when they are not there. They are the people youare   _   of  when you see something they might like, and you know this because you   _  them so well. They are the people whose pictures you have and whose faces are always in yourhead regardless  of what happens.\nFriends are those people you feel   _   around because you know they care about you.They call just to see   _   you are doing, because a friend doesn't need an excuse. They tell youthe   _   and you do the   _  . You know that if you have a(n)   _   , they are there tolisten.\nFriends are the people who won't   _   at you or hurt you, and if they do hurt you they willtry hard to   _   it up to you. They are the people you love, regardless of whether you realize itor not.\nThey are the people who   _   you making mistakes and help you when you do. They stickwith you and stand by you. They are the people whose hands you can   _   . They watch youlive and you watch them live and you learn from them. Your life would not be the same withoutthem.",
