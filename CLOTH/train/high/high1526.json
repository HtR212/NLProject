    "article": "It was one of the happiest Saturday mornings I had spent with my daughter, Gigi. That was, until two strangers threw her into their car and sped away. It seemed like a bad dream.I could  _  speak when the police questioned me. After that, the policeman asked me to go home to wait. My friend Gloria came to  _  me. She took my hand and gave me  a picture  . It was a picture of a little girl  _  asleep in her bed, standing by the bed was a tall, blond  _  . We prayed and waited by the phone until sunset. The  phone  never rang. Suddenly,the front door swung open. I looked up and  _  . There stood Gigi. I cried, throwing my  _  around her. Gigi said:\"I was scared. We were going really fast on an old  _  road I'd never seen before. But then a tall man walked out  in front of  the car,and they ran off the road and hit a tree. Then the tall man  _  the car door and pulled me out. He was really nice,and said I would be okay. I must have gone to  _  , because when I woke up it is in front of our house. He must have brought me home.\" \"But who...how did he know..., where to bring you?\"My voice broke. Gigi  _  her head. Just then Gigi noticed Gloria's picture. \"That's him!\" she  _  at the picture. \"Mommy,that's the man who pulled me out of the car!\" Gloria and I turned  _  . \"Are you sure that's the man?\" Gloria asked. \"Yeah, that's him  except  that he didn't have wings,and he was wearing blue jeans.\" Later that night, the police found the  _  kidnappers. When questioned, the driver remembered turning away to  _  hitting a tall blond man. Twenty years have gone by. We have never heard from any one claiming to have  _  Gigi. There have been no logical explanations for her  _  . But from that day on, I believe that all experiences, positive and negative, are given to us for our strengthening and learning.",
