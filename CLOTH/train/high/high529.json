    "article": "It happens every day, everywhere I go. At the supermarket and the post office, people keep telling me to enjoy my kids while they are   _    . I spend my days taking care of them and answering  _  questions about everything from why we have two eyes but one nose to  _   there are toilets in the heaven. They   _  me from eating a full meal or getting a full   _  sleep. \nYet, the other day, when I took my kids to a children's museum, I began to  _   what people were trying to tell me. It was the  _  time we had gone there without diaper   bag, baby bottle or stroller  . As I watched my sons paint there, I was suddenly   _   by a wave of   _    . My babies weren't babies any more. \nNow I'm paying more attention to the   _  that won't happen when my kids are  _    . I'm enjoying the minute when Christ looked up the sky and cried  _  \"Wow! The moon!\" In a few  _  , it will take a rare Shrek card or something else to get him that excited. I'm  _  the moment when Nicholas put down his fork at dinner and asked, \"Mommy, how are you doing?\" About ten years from now, he  _  not care about me. When they're in primary school, they won't want to hold my  _  any more. In junior high school, they won't hug me and say, \"I love you, too.\" In high school, they won't even want to be   _   together with me. \nPretty  _  they'll both be gone. And I'll  _  through the supermarket and the post office alone, warning young   _  to enjoy their kids while they are little. Hope they'll listen.",
