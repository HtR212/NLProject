It is strange how chary we are about praising.Perhaps it's  _  few of us know how to accept it.It's  _  rewarding to give praise in areas in which  _  generally goes unnoticed or unmentioned.An artist gets admired for a glorious picture,a cook for a  _  meal.But do you ever tell your laundry manager how pleased you are when the shirts are  _  just right?In fact,to give praise  _  the giver nothing but a moment's thought and a moment's effort.",
