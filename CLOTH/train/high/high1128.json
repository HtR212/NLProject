For an hour or so she would walk up and down between the stalls  looking at everything, buying here and there, and  _  a sharp lookout for the bargains that were something to be had.And then, with all the  _  she needs bought ,she would leave the market for the  streets  of the town to spend another hour  in the way  she liked best, looking in furniture-shop windows.\nOne Wednesday she found a  _  shop full of the most delightful things, with a  _  inviting anyone to walk in and look round without  _  they had to buy something. Annie hesitated a moment  _  stepping through the doorway where, almost at once, she stopped  _  before a green armchair. There was a card on the chair which  _  ,\"This fine chair is yours for less than a pound a week,\" and very small at the bottom, \"Cash price eighty-nine pounds fifty.\" A pound a week ...Why, she could almost pay that out of her housekeeping money and never  _  t!\nA voice at her shoulder made her  _  .\"Can I help you, Madam?\" She looked  _  at the assistant who had come softly to her  _  \"Oh, well, no,\" she said, \"I was just  _  .\"\n\"We have chairs of all kinds in the  _  . If you'll just come up, you will find something to  _  you.\"\nAnnie, worried at the thought of being  _  to buy something she didn't  _  , left the shop  _  .",
