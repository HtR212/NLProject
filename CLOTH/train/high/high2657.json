    "article": "Once upon a time, there was a forest where all the animals lived happily together. One day a   _   went to spend the day in the countryside, and one little boy   _   his socks there. Soon after the family left, a bear came by,   _   the socks, and decided to try them on. They fit so well, and he   _   them so much that he wouldn't take them off.\nAll the animals   talked about   the bear's new look, and some of them   _   him for getting so much attention. Before long, in that forest, there began   _   squirrels   in shirts, rabbits in boots  , and   _   rats wearing hats!\nThe forest doctor would   _   his head, telling animals, \"This can't be good. Animals don't wear clothes; we don't   _   them.\"\nBut no one listened to him. They said he was just out of   _  , and didn't know what was popular.\nHowever, it wasn't long before the first   _   of fashionfever came. Several times the squirrel caught his shirt on trees,   _   him in midjump and sending him falling to the ground from a great height. The rat couldn't fit into his   _   without first taking his hat off. Even the bear,   thanks to   his socks, slipped   from one of the river rocks and almost   _   himself.\nWhen the animals came to see the doctor, he gave them all the   _   advice, \"Take off those clothes   _   one day they're going to kill you.\"\nThose who listened to the doctor's advice stopped having   _  . And the animals realized that they didn't need clothes at all. Starting to wear them had been very   _  , and they had only done it to make others admire them, and to get attention.",
