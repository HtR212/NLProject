    "article": "Last weekend I was out walking with my dog. She loves wandering around and seeing  _  we meet, so it becomes a social walk rather than an exercise. Then we  came across  0ur neighbour who was preparing to sell her house. She was busy getting ready for her open house that afternoon . After talking a little we went our separate ways .I could tell it was a(n)  _  day for her. After I got home, I quickly  _  some of the wonderful lavender in my garden Wonderful! They smelled good and the purple  _  were so pretty. I wrapped some packing paper around the bunch and  _  it to my neighbor for her open house. I loved her expression  _  she saw me there with a bunch of lavender! It  _  made me happy. It made her stop and take a deep  breath .  and maybe reduced her stress for a second The next day I had a note in my mailbox from my neighbor thanking me for my  _  . She said everybody commented on how wonderful her house smelled She said the  _  0f kindness I showed helped  _  some of the stress she was feeling. Her note was like a big hug to me. Never  _  that it's the gift from the heart that is the most  _  .I think sometimes we hesitate to do the  _  acts of kindness because we may think they aren't anything but actually they are probably the best gift",
