    "article": "When you are learning English, you find  _  wrong to translate a sentence word for word into your  _  language. Take the sentence \"How do you do?\" as an  _  . If you look  up  each word in the  _  , one at a time, what is your  _  ? It must be a  _  sentence in your native language. Languages do not only have different sounds, they are also  _  in many other ways. It is very  _  to master the rules of word  _  in the study of English, too. If the  _  puts words in a very unusual order, the listener doesn't  _  the speaker's sentence easily. Another thing we must always  emember  is that there are a lot of  _  in the English language. For example when we say \"look out!\" to a man who is in danger, we  _  mean \"Be careful!\" When people are parting, they often say \"Good--bye  or  \" \"Bye--bye!\" But sometimes they  _  say \"Good morning!\" or \"Good afternoon!\" or \"Good evening!\"  _  \"Good night!\" to one another  instead of  \"Good--bye!\" You will find few people  today  who know that \"Good--bye!\" is a short way of saying \"God be with you!\"",
