After learning more about her life, I couldn't help but feel it was not by  _  ,nor happenstance, that she had been named \"Hope\". The strong feeling of sympathy and generosity  _  in her young heart made a lasting impression on me and countless others.  _  I never had the opportunity to meet her, I wish I had. It seems as though she was beyond her tender years and very, very special. Hope was a twelve-year-old girl who was  _  a \"wish\" in early December 2010 by the \"Make-A-Wish\" Foundation after being  _  that she had a rare type of bone cancer. However, when she found out that more than 150  _  in her area like her were waiting for their wishes to be granted, she unselfishly used her wish to  _  that those children have their wishes granted. She also hoped that it could be done  _  January 16, 2011.Unfortunately, however, the organization told her that her  _  request couldn't be granted as the funds were simply  _  . They calculated that they would need to raise more that one  _  dollars in thirty days in order to grant her wish.  _  , but not discouraged, she turned her disappointment into an enthusiasm that inspired warm-hearted  _  to take up helping grant the wishes of the other children, and eventually  _  as well. Newspaper columnists and reporters for radio and TV stations  _  the story of this  _  young girl who had touched the hearts of so many and as word spread, the community was challenged. Committees were fanned and schools, corporations and various organizations assisted in  _  money to help make Hope's dream come true. Her efforts were not in vain as they continued to help others, not only  _  , but spiritually and emotionally as well. At the gathering to celebrate her life, \"A Celebration of Hope\" on January 16,2011, the  _  was made that they had indeed received donations totaling more than one million dollars. Her wish had been granted!",
