    "article": "The other day I was having a meal in an Italian restaurant when I got a phone call from a long lost friend. In my excitement I talked slightly  _  than usual and in Spanish, my mother tongue. A few minutes into the  _  the lady sitting at the table beside mine got up, seemingly  _  , and asked the restaurant staff to find for her another  _  as far away as possible from me. I40 _ in my seat out of embarrassment, feeling the  _  to \ngo over and apologize. \nI looked around and  _  the lady was alone and staring out the window at the table furthest away from me. I was about to stand up when it hit me that she might prefer not to be  _  .  Right then I  _  my plans for a conventional apology and decided to conduct an experiment. Seeing those  _  Smile cards in my wallet I took one out. On signing my restaurant check I asked my waiter to  _  charge the lady's meal to my credit card and  _  her a Smile card instead of her bill.  \nWhen I was  _  I told the staff I would be back in a few hours to pick up my credit card and close the bill. I returned later as I promised, excited to learn the  _  of the experiment. To my pleasant surprise, things  turned out  the best possible way. The restaurant staff happily approached me, telling me that in the many times she had had dinner there before  _  had they seen the old lady smile and laugh like she did  _  \nreceiving the Smile card and the $0  _  . She thanked the staff  even though  they explained that someone else did the job. \n   To top it off, the staff asked me about the Smile cards so as to conduct their own  _  .\nIt was an interesting, fun experiment which may hopefully result in many more.",
