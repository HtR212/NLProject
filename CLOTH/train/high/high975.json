No holding back.\nA story about the violinist Fritz Kreisler tells how he once   came across   a beautiful instrument he wanted to get. When he   _   raised the money for the violin, he returned to   _   it and learned that it had already been sold to a(n)   _   .\nHe went to the new owner's home in order to try to   _   him to sell the violin.   _   , the collector said it was one of his valuable possessions and he could not let it go. The   _   Freisler turned to leave, but then asked a favor. \"May I play the instrument once more   before   it is put away?\"\n  _   was given and the great musician began to play. The   _   sang out a quality of music so beautiful that the collector himself could only listen in   _   . \"I have no   _   to keep that to myself,\" he said after the musician finished. \"The violin is yours, Mr. Kreisler. Take it into the world, and let people   _   it.\"\nFor you and I are excellent violins - our   _   is meant to be heard.\nI want to have my   _   that way - to take it into the world and live it fully. I'd rather be   used up   that die not having done whatever I could ... whatever I would.\nI'm not talking about   _   ourselves by doing too much. Happiness is never found in overmuch busyness. But it is found in applying our lives to helping others. Say yes when asked for a hand.   _   to work for a charity organization. Spend an hour with a   _    .\nIn the end, I know that my happiness is not about what I can or cannot do. It is about how much I   _   to others. My life is meant to be lived.",
