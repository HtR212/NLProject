A father  _  his wife safely at home and rushed to the  _  where his son was supposed to be, only to  _  that the building was as flat as a pancake. Seeing this, he remembered the  _  he had made to this son, \"No matter what happens, I'll always be there for you!\"Tears began to  _  his eyes. As he looked at the pile of  _  that once was the school, it looked  _  , but he kept remembering his words to his son. He began to direct his attention  _  where his son's  _  was.  _  his son's classroom had been in the back right corner of the teaching building, he rushed there and started digging  _  the ruins. He kept digging and digging. Hours later, other  _  parents tried to pull him off  _  had been his son's classroom, saying,\" It's too late! They're all dead!\" But the father kept digging for his son. The fire chief  showed up  and said, \"Fires are breaking out. You're in  _  .
