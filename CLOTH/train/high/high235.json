    "article": "As Apple fans paid attention to every detail, Twitter user, Pratiik Rege, joked that the Apple watch was set at 10:09 in all images because 10:10 was \"just too mainstream.\" He actually may have been  _  .\nYou may not have  _  but the default setting   in advertisements for many new watches is 10:10. Many well-known brands,  _  Rolex and Tag Heuer, set their watches to this time for their advertisements. Could Apple have set their watch at 10:09 to  _  they are ahead of the others? Perhaps,  _  a quick look at other watch advertisements suggests Apple is not the first to  turn away from  the 10 past 10 time. That's because many companies show their watches at this time  _  for artistic reasons. It makes  _  therefore to adjust it by just a few minutes  _  this standard time according to what particular brands think  _  their watch best.\nHowever, it is thought that around 10 past 10 shows the watch at the best  _  .\nIf the logo is  _  underneath the 12, this time also has the advantage of \"framing\" the brand name between the two hands. It's also a symmetrical   time, making it  _  to the eye. Often manufacturers photograph the watch with the second hand in a position  _  emphasises this proportionality  . Another favorite time with clock vendors has been 20 past 8, because of its symmetry. However, 10 past 10 is  _  to be a more \"positive\" time by brand experts, as it looks as if the  _  of the watch is smiling.\nIt's likely that Apple decided to set its time at 10:09 to  _  itself within watch-making tradition. It may just be a minute in time, but 10:09 is further  _  that Apple is taking its new watch very seriously, This is not being  _  to as a \"smart watch\"; this is a watch that both wearable tech and the watch industry should take  _  .",
