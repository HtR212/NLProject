    "article": "Britain and Ireland The British Isles is made up of two large islands: One is called Ireland and the other  _  Britain, or Great Britain, is the larger of these two islands, and it is  _  into three parts: Scotland, Wales and England. The United Kingdom is that  _  of the British Isles ruled over by the Queen. It is made up of Scotland, Wales and England, that is, the  _  of Britain, and also about one sixth of Ireland, the Northern part. The  _  of Ireland is self-governing. The  _  name of the United Kingdom is  _  \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\".  England  is larger and richer than Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and has the largest  _  of the United Kingdom, so people often use the  _  \"England\" and \"English\" when they  _  \"Britain\" and \"British\". This sometimes makes the Scots and the Welsh a little  _  . The Scots in particular are very  _  of their separate nationality. The Welsh too do not regard  _  as English, and have a culture and even a  _  of their own. Ireland became part of the United Kingdom in 1801, but for forty years the \"Irish  _  \" was the greatest headache of the United Kingdom.  At last  , Ireland is divided into two: Northern Ireland still  _  to the United Kingdom, and in 1922 the rest of Ireland  broke away  to found an Irish Free State, later called Eire and now the Republic of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland does not regard itself as part of Britain, and is not now even a supporter of the Commonwealth of Nations . Unlike the major Commonwealth countries it did not lift a finger to  _  British in the Second World War and now wants the whole of Ireland to be a republic.",
