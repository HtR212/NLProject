    "article": "One day I took my son to the doctor's for physical examination and being flu   season there were several children there with physical and mental disabilities. Right   _   from us was a man with his son in a wheel chair. The chair secured   the boy who probably   couldn't sit up on his own. The boy   _   very slowly and was seriously mentally and physically challenged. But his eyes   _   up when I asked his Daddy if I could   _   my son to him. Jeremy had been   staring at   him and told me he couldn't talk normally, so I asked the dad if I could   _   him. The dad seemed   _   too, so I crossed the room to sit down right by him and asked the boy his   _  . He said, \"Tim\". I said, \"Hi, Tim, this is Jeremy.\" Then I asked, \"How old are you, Tim?\" He said, 'Ten.\" While I talked with him, I rubbed   his leg   _   and I could see he was trying to put his   _   out for me to catch it. The conversation was short but   _  . The nurse then called them in and the dad   _   me and we said goodbye.\nOn the way home, I was able to explain to Jeremy that Tim has   _   just like any boy who wants to   fit in  . He wants to have friends and experience life and love his family. He doesn't want to be laughed at or pointed at just   _   he is different.\nI don't know if it made a(an)   _   on Jeremy that day, but I feel that it did. We will   _   to speak with whoever comes along our path no matter how   _   they are from us. Teaching our children not to stare is probably   _  . But teaching them to share a   _   with people who are different is truly remarkable  !",
