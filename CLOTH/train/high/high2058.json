He only ate one meal a day for a month but continued to work as he normally did.\nDuring the first five days he was   _   at his regular mealtime, but after he had drunk a glass of water, his hunger   went away     . In the morning, when he ate his one meal, he ate quickly and had a  _   amount. During the next few days, he was not hungry during the day, but when he   _   a food stall (a place on which food is put to be sold), the smell of food caught his   _   . During the third and the fourth weeks, he had hunger pains and lacked physical strength. He looked forward to one meal and ate it slowly, enjoying every bite. Without it, he knew he would have hardly enough    _  to work.\nThis experiment changed his attitude about some things. Having a cup of tea was not   _   a pastime . It also gave him strength. He more frequently noticed overweight people and people who threw away leftover food. He   _   the importance of food to hungry person. He could no longer easily pass by a hungry beggar on the street. But most   _    , he could now sympathize  in a similar way with the hungry people of the world.",
