When I found it, the ice cream seller was  _  waiting but the little boy had  _  . I went in the  _  I thought he might have gone and I saw a  _  getting out of her vehicle. I asked her if she had a little boy and she said yes. She then told me that she and her son had gone to the grocery store the day before and had  _  ice cream but she did not have enough money to buy  _  . She quickly went into the  _  to get her son, and when she  _  several minutes later, I realized that he was not the  _  little boy I had seen. This boy was a bit older and his sister came out with him. I took them both to the truck and let them  _  out what they wanted. I  _  told the mom it was not the same boy I was talking about.
