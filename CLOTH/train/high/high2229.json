But all too often as parents and teachers we disallow\nthis  _  right to our children. When I see a child  _  to this kind of pressure, I think of Donnie.\nDonnie was my youngest third grader. His    _  of failure kept him from classroom games that\nother children enjoyed. He  _  answered questions -- he might be\nwrong.\nI tried my best to build his    _  . But nothing changed until midterm, when Mary Anne, a\nstudent teacher, was assigned to our classroom.   \nShe was young and pretty, and she loved children. My pupils, Donnie included,   _  her.\nOne morning, we were working math problems at the chalkboard. Donnie had   copied  the problems with\npainstaking neatness. Pleased with his progress, I  _  the children\nwith Mary Anne and went for art materials. When I returned, Donnie was in  _  . He'd missed the third problem.\nMy student teacher looked at me in despair. Suddenly her face    _  . From the desk we shared, she got\na container filled with pencils.\n\"Look, Donnie,\" she said, kneeling beside him and gently   _  the tear-stained face from his\narms. \"I've got something to  _  you.\" She removed the pencils,\none at a time, and placed them on his desk.\n\"See these  _  ,\nDonnie,\" she continued. \"They belong to Mrs. Lindstrom and me. See\nhow the erasers are  _  ? That's because we make mistakes too. But we\nerase the mistakes and try again. That's what you  _  learn to do,\ntoo.\"\nShe kissed him and stood up. \"Here,\" she said, \"I'll leave one of these pencils on   your  desk\nso you'll remember that everybody makes mistakes,  _  teachers.\" Donnie looked up with love in his eyes and a\nsmile.\nThe pencil became Donnie's    _  possession. That, together with Mary Anne's\nfrequent encouragement, gradually  _  him that it's all right to\nmake mistakes -- as long as you erase them and try again.",
