I  _  read of a music teacher who commented to a discouraged student, \"  _  else can make the sound that you make. The sound that you make may not be the same as someone else's but who is to say which is  _  . \" It is said that, \"  _  is in the eye of the beholder , \" perhaps it could be said that \"a delightful sound is in the ear of the  _  . \" Every person has a different tone of voice that  _  only to them,  _  we all know people with an unforgettable laugh or a way of  _  that is unique to them.
