    "article": "Growing up like all children, when I was growing up all I wanted was to be growth up. I always kept a close eye on my role  _  --my parents, and always tried to do anything they did. The skills I learnt and the attitude I  acquired  from a young age would be of great help to me in my   _  years.\nFrom the age of four or five, the memories I have are those of   _  my parents in their shop and helping them sell goods. The job I did was just  _  on the chair so that I could reach the counter and   _   at everyone who came in.   _  these are so insignificant, I always got a sense of  _  and satisfaction in my work. When I was seven years old, I went to primary school and my family moved  to  the town   _   I lived today.  At the beginning,  everything around me was  _  . I felt it hard to breathe  _   friends. But my families told me: \"Never be a   _  ! Keep smiling and try to play with others!\" So I tried to smile at others and play with others. Soon, it   _  . I got my happiness again. And those words are always in my   _  till today. Now, as a high school student, I have a nice class and many charming and   _  friends and teachers around me. I feel  _  and beautiful! Meanwhile, the support that I have received and   _  to receive from my family is always a major  _  for me to succeed as well.\nIn my opinion, everyone's growth is full of good and bad experiences all the time. The key is to  appreciate  the good ones and find a way of turning a negative situation into a   _   one.",
