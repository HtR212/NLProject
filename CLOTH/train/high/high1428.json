    "article": "Nowadays, most people like to enter the university or college in order to increase their knowledge and find their career. Some people believe that college or university education should be  _  to all students. Others,  _  , think that higher education should be ready only for good students . If I have to agree with one of these two conditions. I would rather  stand behind  the former.\nFirstly, university and college  _  students to change their habits and behavior. There are two kinds of students at schools: clever and  _  students. Classroom environment of the university and powerful students are the most important  _  which can influence the weak students to  _  their lifestyle.\nSecondly, educatees with low IQs are able to help their  _  . Students with low intelligence can work hard to  _  their knowledge by paying attention to their own professors and performing their assignments  _  delay. Therefore, they can increase the  _  level of their country by using their knowledge and experience.  For instance  , I have a friend who was poor and had to work all the day to  _  his tuition fees at high school. Thus, he did not have enough time to read his books and do homework, and he got  _  scores in all of his subjects. However, after he was  _  to a college, he paid more attention to his courses. He  _  an instrument which  _  the disabled people to move from one  _  to another. If he hadn't gone to college, he would not have created that machine.\nIn short, all types of students have equal rights. They have to be allowed to enter the college and university to receive a higher education and improve their  _  . Attending university can  _  lead to reduce the crime rate in advanced countries.",
