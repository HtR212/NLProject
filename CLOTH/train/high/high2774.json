    "article": "Surrounded by rolling green hills dotted with horses and cows, the town of Waimea on Hawaii's Big Island is a peaceful and friendly place. One afternoon, while staying with friends at their house there, my husband and I decided to go for a  _  along the many, mostly traffic-free, country lanes in the area. We met a beautiful Golden Retriever. He seemed  _  friendly so we stopped to play with him,  _  a stick which he retrieved several times happily. When we  _  our walk, he followed us, and although I worried that he  _  be going too far from his home, I couldn't deny that we were enjoying his  _  . After about twenty minutes, we found ourselves walking along a dirt road in an unfamiliar area. One house, almost hidden by shrubbery and shaded by tall trees,seemed  _  strange. I felt an urge to be as far away from that place as possible. Just then, the door to the house creaked open and five dogs  rushed out  , barking and growling as they ran toward us. I felt  _  and couldn't move. There was nowhere to  _  and no time to run.. All of a sudden, our new friend appeared between the dogs and us. He faced them - all five of them - growling and baring his teeth. I was  _  to see the attacking dogs stop in their tracks ten feet away from him. Our protector  _  them there while we escaped.  _  a safe distance, we looked back and saw the five dogs  _  back toward their house. But the Golden Retriever was  _  in sight. I felt an ache in my  _  ; I missed our friend already. Instinctively, I knew he was not hurt. With a feeling of  _  , we made our way back to the house,  _  the whole way that we would see him again. But it was not to be. When I told our friend about the encounter, her eyes flew wide open  _  she exclaimed, \"It was an angel!\" To this day I have no  _  that a four-legged angel protected us.",
