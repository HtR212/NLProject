I could tell from her expression that she wasn't   _   to see a student worker. \n\"What do you want me to do?   _    the coffee?\" Rose   _   and went away. I filled the pot with cold water and began making coffee when Rose suddenly   _   and took over, \"That's not the   _   to make coffee.\" I was   _   as I just followed the steps our supervisor   showed us. \n  _  I did pleased her. All morning her eyes missed nothing and her words   _   me. Totally tired, I came home late that afternoon. Fighting back   _   , I thought of my situation alone in my room. Should I see if my supervisor would change my   _  ? But I didn't want to   give in   . Then I had the answer -- I needed to   _   her.\nWorking with Rose the next morning, I   _    her sharp   words and did things in her way as much as possible. Things began to    change   over the next few days. She became   _   to me. As I worked with this   _  woman, I listened to her -- something no one else had done. \nI never   _   Rose again after that summer,   _   I still remember her. That summer I learned a lesson that love is the best way to turn an enemy   into a friend.",
