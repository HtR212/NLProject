    "article": "When I was in college twenty-five years ago, I spent four summers working in  _  at a luxury hotel in downtown Chicago.  In other words  , I was a maid. I did not enter the world of housekeeping enthusiastically. My friends had  _  jobs such as making ice cream, selling goods at the mall, or life guarding at the outdoor pool. I had been hoping to get a job as an office lady for a famous company:  _  pay, air-conditioned office, the gold standard for summer jobs, as most of us dreamed of. When that  fell through  , the only option left was to take a train ride downtown each morning to work as a maid. It was tiring work, cleaning up to eighteen rooms a day. My  _  attitude reflected my disdain for cleaning toilets,  _  bed sheets, dusting, eight hours a day for the comfort of total strangers who  _  left a tip. I thought it was beneathme. My maid work was average  _  the day I was assigned to the eighteenth floor. That was Lorena's regular floor. The only time another maid set foot on it was on Lorena's day off. If you left any water  _  on the mirror, or a hair on the bed, Lorena would hunt you down when she  _  , as I found out firsthand. She'd ended her lecture to me with \"  _  some pride in your work.\" She did. And so did Rosalie, Helen, Annette, and all the other experienced maids. Their devotion to doing a good job and their belief that their work was a  _  of their character stuck with me throughout my  _  career after graduation. I learned a lot from them during those four summers. Not a week would go without one of them  _  some firm but friendly advice: \"Where's your commode brush? You don't have one? How do you expect to get that bowl clean?\" Their pride in a job well done was reflected in how they treated  _  . They left the building at the end of the day in nice dresses and  _  makeup. They looked like they could have been attending an afternoon tea. And,  _  often, they were smiling and laughing, cheerfully greeting their co-workers a good evening. When you work with happiness and  _  , a job will be well done. I believe there is  _  in any job if you work hard and try your best.",
