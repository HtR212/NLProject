It was already dark outside. The first thing I needed to do was to find a place to   _  . I decided to telephone the youth hotel. But to use the   _   I needed some coins . I asked a lady for   help   . To my surprise, she  _     me three coins to use. But all the phones in the   _   needed phone cards. And phone cards could only be  _   at post-office during the daytime. I was afraid I   _   call the hotel. An old gentleman helped me. He couldn't speak English but   _   that I needed to make a phone call. He showed me where the   _   was and inserted  his phone card. I called the youth hotel and found a place to stay that night. The kindness of  the German people   made me feel that I was not far from    home   . And my first day in Germany wasn't as   _   as I expected.\n   Whenever I went, I asked people for  _   . It surprised me that almost every young German could speak English  fluently  . Older Germans   couldn't   speak English very well, but they would try to help me whenever they could. One middle-aged man I   asked for  directions even drove me to the place I was looking for. My experience in Germany completely changed my  _  of Germans. Before, I thought they were unfriendly to foreigners. In many World War II films Germans are   unfriendly   . But things changed   since then  . And the people couldn't be  _   friendly.",
