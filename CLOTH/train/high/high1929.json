    "article": "Our planet isn't in very good shape right now. The air is  _  . The ocean is polluted. The problem we're facing is really  _  . It may seem like there's so much we need to do, to make things right. And that's the  _  . We don'tneed to do more.  _  we need to do less.\nLet's take a look at some of the  _  we can use the power of LESS to save the planet.\nDriving less, walking more. Not only will you be saving the environment, you'll be saving your  _  as well.\nWanting less, appreciating more. Instead of wanting a big home you can't afford, maybe you should live in a smaller home in a  _  expensive area.\nTalking less, listening more. We usually spend most of our time  _  . And actually you would be  _  how much people never really hear each other at all. Think about how your life can be improved by  _  people better.\nSpend more  _  being mindful. We often  _  alot of time trying to do too many things  at once  .We try to print a report and  _  on the phone at the same time. Doing this we run the  _  of printing the wrong pages and saying the wrong thing.\nBuy less things. The more things we  _  , the more resources we take from the planet. The more we buy, the larger that  _  becomes. Buying new things isn't really a bad thing.  _  is our desire to buy the newest and greatest each year or every few months that is dangerous. After all, that  _  thing has to go somewhere. And it's probably in the landfill somewhere.\nHow can you use the  _  of LESS to help save the planet? I would love to hear your ideas.",
