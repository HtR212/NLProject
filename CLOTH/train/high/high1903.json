They decided to do  _  for the nature conservation.\nThe sisters studied the  _  habits of their friends and neighbors. \"We're a(n)  _  town of 260 homes, and we found out only 20 percent of them  _  !\" Allison says.\nMoved to act, they first organized a town fair with demonstrations about how  _  people could make lasting changes to the environment. They  _  local companies to join them and the fair  _  a crowd of about 200 people. On the scene were trucks and booths  where volunteers and company workers accepted  _  electronic equipment, eyeglasses, clothes and books--all for recycling.\nThe girls are planning another  _  this year. \"It's an education campaign,\" says Allison. \"People don't know, but there are so many simple things they can do every day that can  _  the nature.\"\nAllison now reports on the environment for her school's television station. Both girls devote their spare  _  to various recycling projects around the town,such as giving old toys to children's charities and collecting  _  clothes for the people in need.\nAnd should anyone think that they're awfully single-minded, they are  _  . The sisters have many  _  other interests: ballet, volleyball,singing and deep-sea diving with their dad. \"They're basically optimistic,\" said their dad.",
