    "article": "I've come to the conclusion that I'm rubbish at saying \"NO\".For example, last Sunday I was sitting at my desk alone,totally   _   in my own business, when a colleague   of mine phoned and asked me to get involved in   _   with her. I found myself getting all caught up in her enthusiasm and didn't want to   _   her.So I said \"Sure,why not?\" and before the call had   _  , I found myself agreeing without giving any   _   whether it was worth doing.\nWe are both window-shoppers and   _   a whole day in the street. Actually, I hardly have any time to spare because I am very busy   apart from   my normal job--I've also got a book to write,a business to   _   and a family to look after. And then there are my other projects to   _  -- my voluntary work and a couple of other interesting investments  that I want to   work on  . I'm going to have to be more ruthless and not just agree to   _   people ask me to get involved in. In other words,I'm going to have to get   _   at saying \"NO\".Usually I hate saying \"NO\",because having to disappoint someone usually   _   me. Now I realize   _   I haven't learned to say \"NO\". I've been feeling very   _  .\nWe had better do what we think is right and what we are   _   to do.Sometimes it does not seem that bad to   _   others.If I focus on the things I   _   want to be involved in,I'11 reach a much higher standard and do it quite   _  . I'1l be enthusiastic and motivated and do something that is good for everyone and everyone will be happy.It'11 be a win-win   _  . What's not good about that? So sometimes, we have to say \"NO\".",
