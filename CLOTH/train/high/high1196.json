After graduating from college in 1932, I   _  to try for\na job in radio, then work my way up to a sports announcer. I  _   on the door of every station in Chicago and was refused every\ntime. In one studio, a kind lady told me that  _  stations\nwould't hire an inexperienced person and advised me to try in small\nstations that  _  give me a chance.\nI went to Dixon, Illinois, where a local athlete was   _  to manage its\nsports department. Since Dixon was   where   I\nhad played football, the job  _  just right for\nme. So I applied,  _   I wasn't hired.\nMy disappointment must\nhave shown. \"  _  happens for the best,\" Mom\nreminded me. Dad  _  me the car to hunt for job.\nI tried a radio station in Davenport, Iowa. The program director told me they\nhad  _  hired a sports announcer. I was very\ndisappointed and asked aloud, \"How can a fellow get to be a sports\nannouncer if he can't get a job in a radio station?\"\nI was about to go when I heard the   _  calling, \"Do you know anything about\nfootball?\" Then he stood me  _  a microphone\nand asked me to broadcast an imaginary game.\nOn my   _  home,\nI thought of my mother's words: \"If you carry on, one day something good\nwill happen. Something wouldn't have happened without some\ndisappointments.\"",
