I  _  her room in a hurry and stood at the doorway. She was an older woman, sitting at the edge of the bed,  _  to put socks on her swollen feet. I crossed the threshold , spoke  _  to the nurse, and scanned her chart noting she was in stable condition. I was almost in the clear.\nI leaned on the bedrail looking  _  at her. She asked if I could help put on her socks.\n  _  , I began a monologue that went something like this: \"How are you feeling? Your sugars and blood pressure were high but they're  _  today. The nurse mentioned you're anxious to see your  _  who's visiting you today. It's nice to have a family visit from far away. I bet you really look forward to seeing him.\"\nEach story is  _  . Some are detailed; others are vague. Some have a beginning, middle and end. Others wander without a clear  _  . Some are true; others not. Yet all those things do not really  _  . What matters to the storyteller is that the story is  _  --without interruption, assumption or judgment.\nListening to someone's story costs  _  than expensive diagnostic testing but is key to healing and diagnosis.\nI often thought of  _  the woman taught me, and I reminded myself of the  _  of stopping, sitting down and truly listening. And, not long after, in an unexpected  _  , I became the patient, with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis at age 31. Now, 20 years later, I sit all the time --in a wheelchair.\nFor  as long as  I could, I continued to see patients from my chair, but I had to resign when my hands were  _  . I still teach medical students and other health care professionals, but now from the perspective of  _  and patient.\nI tell them I believe in the power of  _  . I tell them I know firsthand that immeasurable healing takes place within me  _  someone stops, sits down and listens to my story.",
