In those days men were expected to be  _  and rugged and never shed a tear no matter what. Our  _  were all stone faced cowboys who were too  _  to cry. Believing this then I tried my best  _  to cry at all during my teenage and early adult years. All that changed,  _  , as I was driving home alone one night shortly after my Mom  _  . It was dark and raining outside. I was struggling to  _  the car on the road while at the same time  _  to hold the tears back in my eyes. I remember almost going off the road twice as I blinked back the salty water that was burning my  _  and blurring my vision. My hands shook, my heart  _  , and my soul felt dead.  _  I could do it no longer. I stopped, pulled over, lay my head on the steering wheel, and  _  . I cried until the tears couldn't fall anymore. I cried until the pain that I was holding onto so  _  finally fled my heart. After that night I  _  something. Big boys do cry.  In fact  , it is the biggest hearts that cry the most. I realized too that it is our  _  that can release us from our anger and our grief while  _  us to our love and our God. Tears help us to embrace this often bittersweet life. They help us to keep growing  _  to each other in love and joy instead of  _  ourselves up in dull, aching, and lonely hearts.",
