So we went   _   into his backyard.\nWhen we started   _   his strawberries, all of a sudden Mr Jordan came outside.\n\"What are you boys doing out here?\" he   _   and tried to grab one or two as my friends rushed past him, but they were too   _   for the older gentleman to seize, and all the boys except me disappeared within seconds.\nSpeed was never my   _  .So I could just stand there and   _   whatever punishment would surely come my way from Mr Jordan.\nHe marched me to my house and my mother criticized me. My friends gathered to celebrate their   _   and observe my capture. They   _   me about it for days afterwards, while all I could do was complain to my father about how   _   it was.\n\"I don't think so,\" Dad said. \"You got the punishment you   _  .\"\n\"But what about other guys?\" I asked.\nDad said, \"You can't   _   what happens to other people. You can only   _   what happens to you. You picked Mr Jordan's strawberries that night, and you were punished for it. To me, that is completely fair.\"\nThen I couldn't   _   my father's words.   _   through the years I knew what he talked about. We didn't come to earth with a   _   that life would treat us fairly.\nLike Dad said, the   _   thing we can actually   deal with   is what happens to us. How we choose to respond to what happens to us is truly the   _   by which the quality of our lives will be measured whether or not we think it happens fairly.",
