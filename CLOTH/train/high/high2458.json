Yet no one   _  understands why flowers open and close like this at particular times. The process is not as  _   as we might think, as recent experiments have shown. In one study, flowers were kept in constant  _  . We might expect that the flowers, without any information about the time of day, did not open as they   _  do. As a matter of fact, they   _  to open at their usual time. This suggests that they have some mysterious  way of knowing the   _  . Their sense of time does not  depend on  information from the outside world; it is, so to speak, inside them, a kind of \"inner clock\". \nThis  _  may not seem to be very important. However, it was later found that not just plants but also  _  , including man, have this \"inner clock\" which  _  the working of their bodies and influences their activities. Men, then, are also influenced by this mysterious  _  . Whether we wish it or not, it affects such things in our life as our need for sleep, our need for food. \nIn the past, this did not really  _  because people lived in natural condition. In the  _   world, things are different; now there are spacemen, airplane pilots and, in ordinary life, a lot of people who have to work at night. It would be very  _  , then, to know more about the \"inner clock\". Such things as flowers might help us understand more about ourselves.",
