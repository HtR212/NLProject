My brother had autism and Attention Deficit Disorder -- serious  _  conditions. At 15, he  _  like a 7-year-old child. When he was little, I didn't  _  it as much. But as he got older, it became more obvious. When something didn't go his  _  , he got angry and it took hours to  _  him down. He would talk to himself and play with string. We could never  _  to give him his medicine, otherwise he'd go wild. I was always  _  when we took him anywhere, and I never wanted to bring any of my friends  _  with me. When I was 10, I felt like I couldn't  _  it any more. I'd shout at him for being different and would ask  _  he couldn't be normal. Of course, he had no  _  what I was talking about. It became very hard,  _  when a friend of mine didn't want to come over  _  her mom had said my brother was dangerous. Our fights  _  up until one day he came up to me. He gave me a big  _  , like he was saying, \"I don't know what I did  _  , but I hope you still love me.\" At that moment I realized that I'd better learn to  _  him. As I've gotten older, I've learned how  _  I really am. Having him as a brother has made me kinder and more patient. No matter how busy my  _  is, he'll always listen to my problems. I worry about his future, but I know he'll always be loved.",
