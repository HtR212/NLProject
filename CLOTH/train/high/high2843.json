    "article": "My wife and I had just finished the 150mile trip home from our daughter's college. It was the first time in our lives that we would   _    for any length of time. We wondered how other people had     _    it.\nLater in bed,I    _     the time I started college. My father had driven me too. My mother had to stay home to keep the    _   from getting into the crops. I,the fourth in a line of brothers,was the first to    go away to   college.\nThe truck was slow,and I was glad. I didn't want to get to the city   too soon  .I shook hands with my father in the truck and he didn't say a word. But I knew he was going to make a little    _   .He finally said,\"I never went to college and   _    of your brothers did. I can't say don't do this or that,because everything is    _    and I don't know what is going to come up,but I think things will    work out   .When you get a job,be sure to be honest and work hard.\" I knew that soon I would be   _     in the big town and I would be    _    the life home.\nThen my father   brought out     the Bible   that he had read so often. I knew that he would miss it but I must    _    it. He just said,\"This can help you    _    you will let it.\"\nWhen I finished school I took the Bible     _    to my father. But he said he wanted me to     _    it.\nNow,too late,I remember. It would have been so     _   to give it to my daughter when she got out of the car. But I didn't. My father could give me only a Bible,but I don't really believe now that I gave her half as     _   as my father gave me. So the next morning I      _    up the book and sent it to her. I wrote a note. \"This can help you,\"I said,\"if you will let it.\"",
