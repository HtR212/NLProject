    "article": "Last night my mother told me a story of an old man and I was touched by it. A girl became a volunteer in the activities of Deathbed Care, which meant visiting and taking care of a patient suffering from a/an   _   disease with days numbered.\nThe girl was  _   to look after an old man suffering from cancer whose children lived abroad. Their living conditions were not satisfactory  _   the old man had a lot of savings, so she was expected to comfort him and   keep up   his spirits.\nEvery Saturday the girl came on time to keep him   _   , telling him stories. When he was having an intravenous drip , she would help gently press his   _   . The doctor found the patient much improved   _   . The old man began to involve himself actively  _   the medical treatment and he seldom    _   at others.\nBut something that happened made the doctor uneasy and puzzled. Each time the girl left, the old man would  _   her some money. The doctor did nothing to interfere ,  _  to offend the old man. Later the old man showed evident signs of  _   after suffering coma a few times.\nWhen   _  . from the latest coma, the old man told the doctor his last wish, \"I have deep   _   for the girl. Will you be kind enough to help her   _   her studies?\" But the doctor knew that her family was   _   and she had no difficulty pursuing her studies. Sometimes she even came to the hospital in her father's car. \nWhen the girl came at the weekend after the death of the old man, the doctor told her the bad news. She was very sad and burst into   _  . Then she handed $500 to the doctor, saying, \"The old man had all along thought I came to do the job because of   _   . He gave me money so that I could continue my   _  .\" Now he got the answer to the puzzle. In the last period of his life, the old man found it a real pleasure to be able to help a girl   _   in need. The story taught me that we are responsible for reaching out to others with kindness.",
