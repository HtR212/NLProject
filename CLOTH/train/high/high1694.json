    "article": "Samuel was back at the bookshop. He had only one goal in mind---to find a book that he had not   _   the previous day. The book was one of the seven that he had   _   to buy. But at the last moment, he changed his   _  . He put all seven back on the shelf.\nSamuel had a personal   _   at home with over 1,000 books--- almost all unread. He had more reading material in his small   _   than he could finish in two lifetimes, yet his   _   for more remained burning. He finally   _  put his foot down. \"Not one more book\", he told himself, \"  _  it was really special.\" In fact, yesterday's book fit the bill. It was a biography of one of his favorite authors----Stephen King, one of America's most   _   fiction authors. But it wasn't   _   for King himself---early in his   _  , he got hundreds of rejection  notices. Samuel wanted to be a great   _   and King was his role model.\nSamuel immediately  _   one of the books he had piled up yesterday, and in minutes, he found all except one--- the Stephen King book. \"What a   _  !\" he thought, \"The one that I want to find is the one that I can't find\"\nSamuel took a walk   _  the shop, knowing that people often pick up something in one place and then leave it in another. The book was a thick paperback with a red cover. But it was   _   to be found.\nSo for Samuel, the big   _   was on. Every bookshop he went to would involve a search for the King book. This new search added the   _   to his bookshop life.\nSamuel had held something special in his hands. But only when he   let it go   did he realize its value. When he found it again, it would   _   be his favorite book that he never got around to reading.",
