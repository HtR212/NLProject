    "article": "I was fat kid who grew into an overweight adult. I was  _  laughed at for being heavier than the other kids,  leaving  me feeling shy. I tried several diets, but  none  worked, and I  ended up  gaining weight. Another factor  contributing to  my weight gain was my love for cooking, especially rich, high-fat desserts, which I enjoyed preparing and, of course, eating. When I finished high school at the age of 18, I weighed 215 pounds.  lacking  the self-confidence to go to a new, faraway school, I decided to stay close to home  instead of  going away to college. I continued with my unhealthful eating habits and felt more miserable as the weight came on, but I did nothing about it except buy larger plus-size clothes. My turning point came 10 years later at a friend's New Year's Eve party when I was at my all-time highest weight of 330 pounds. I caught my  _  in a mirror and the truth  _  me: I was overweight and unhealthy, and unless I did something about it now, I would only get bigger and  _  . After leaving the party, I thought about my past weight-loss  _  and realized they didn't work because they required me to abandon foods I loved. Then I would constantly think about food and binge,  giving up  the diet  _  my hunger and not feel deprived. My biggest  _  was finding a way to fit my passion for cooking into my healthier lifestyle. At first, I tried to stay away from the kitchen to  _  myself thinking about food. The result: Food was all I thought about.  _  had to be some way to combine cooking with healthful eating. I found the  _  after reading several low-fat cookbooks. With some trial and error, I could modify my favorite foods and make them low in fat, yet delicious. The pounds started coming off, and when I started exercising (usually cardio and weight training five times a week), they seemed to melt away. I didn't feel deprived, and I felt free to give my body the care and attention it  _  I lost 165 pounds over the next two years. I had many ups and downs. I was determined to go on. Another challenge to me was not to beat myself up if I ate something that was unhealthy and to take it as a sign to abandon my healthful habits.  _  I vowed to start again and always keep my goal in mind. Thanks to losing weight and becoming fit I am  in line with  my body and myself. I have finally found myself.",
