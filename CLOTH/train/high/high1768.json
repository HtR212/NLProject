I began when I was only five.I used to   _  for the postman's arrival,always   _  to seize unwanted envelops and tear  _  the corner with the stamp  stuck  on it.\n    Once I remember it all too clearly---my mother and father were sunning themselves in the garden when the post   _  on the\ndoormat.I heard the clatter of the letter flap and hurriedly went to   _  . There were four or five envelopes,all with very attractive stamps.\nEven at the   _  age of five I knew one doesn't open mail addressed to other people.\nHowever, tearing just the comers off the envelops   _  me as\nperfectly fair and allowable,and that's what I did,I carefully tore as   _  to the stamps as  _  feeling that even the envelopes,  _  were addressed to my parents and not to me,should be treated with   _  .\n    There was nothing furtive in what I did, I knew my parents would see   _  I'd done, and I didn't think there\nwas any  _  in it.They always let me   _  the corners\nafter they'd opened them.Why should I think there was any harm in doing it first,  _   in mind that they weren't on hand to be   _  .Wouldn't they rather be left to doze in their summer deckchairs?   _  ,though,my father severely showed me his letters.They looked distinctly very old with bites   taken  out of the corners and sides.I began to   _  what I'd done!",
