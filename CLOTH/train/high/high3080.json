Please make your safe belts fastened.\" Many passengers became   _   , talking about it with each other. At once it became   _   in the plane.\nSoon, lighting   lit up   the darkening skies, and within moments the   _   was like a boat on waves in the storm. One moment it was   _   up by the storm; the next, it was thrown as if it were to   _   onto the ground. All the passengers were   _   . Some cried. Some prayed  . The   _   seemed hopeless. I wondered if we could   _   it through the storm.\nThen I noticed the little girl next to me. Surprisingly, the storm seemed to mean   _   to her. She was   _   , looking through a picture book. Sometimes she closed her eyes, then she would   _    again, but she never showed a (n)   _   of worry or fear. The little girl wasn't afraid at all   _  all the adults were scared to death. Finding me watching her, the girl smiled at me and said, \" Don't worry. My father is the pilot. He is taking me home. Take it easy. He will take us home safely.\"\nWhen the plane was out of   _   , I smiled at the girl and she gave me a big smile in   _  . \"I said my father would take us home safely.\"\n Many kinds of storms may   _   us: diseases, difficulties... They can easily darken our skies and   _   our planes into \nhard times. Let us   _   : Love is the pilot. It will help us out of trouble. So take it easy.",
