On seeing him, the dad  _  , \"Why did you take all this  _  to come? Don't you know that my son s life is in danger? Don't you have any sense of  _  ?\" The doctor smiled and said, \"I am sorry, I wasn't in the hospital and I  _  as fast as I could after receiving the call...And now, I wish you'd calm down work.\"  so that  I can do my work.\" \"Calm down? What if your son is in this room right now, would you calm down? If your own son is  _  now what will you do?\" said the father  _  . The doctor smiled again and replied,\" I will say what Job said in the Bible 'From dust we came and to dust we return, blessed by the name of God'.  _  cannot extend lives. Go and  _  for your son.we will do our best by God's grace.\" \"Giving advice when we re not  _  is so easy.\" murmured the father.The operation took some hours  _  which the doctor went out happily. \"Thank goodness! Your son is saved ! \" And without waiting for the father's reply he carried on his  _  running. \"If you have any question, ask the nurse!\" \"Why is he so  _  ? He couldn't wait some minutes so that I could ask about my son's  _  ?\" commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left. The nurse answered,  _  coming down her face, \"His son died yesterday in a road accident.He was in the funeral when we called him for your son's operation.  _  now that he saved your son's life, he left running to finish his son's funeral.\" Never  _  anyone...because you never know how their life is and what they're  _  .",
