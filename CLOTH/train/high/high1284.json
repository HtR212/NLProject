    "article": "A couple of months ago I was renting a house to work from. I was fairly well set up,   _   didn't own a lawn mower  and after a week I realized I had to find some way to deal with the growing   _  ! But I was on a fairly   _   budget  which couldn't pay a lawn-mowing company.\nI was thinking about this one Sunday as the \"Mr. Whippy\" ice cream van     pulled up   outside on the street. I hadn't had a Mr. Whippy ice cream for years, and I   _   my coin purse and headed   _  . On the pavement were three young   _   playing. They may have been from next door, but I was new there and hadn't really met anyone yet.\nIt was a   _   day and I asked them if they'd like an ice cream. \"Yes, please,\" they replied   _  . At that moment a fourth boy   joined  them from the neighboring house. And there was just enough change to cover   _   ice creams. As I left the van, I heard the lady serving the boys say, \"that was a really   _   thing that lady did for you boys. Don't forget to   _   her.\" I smiled as I went inside to carry on   _  .\nI left for work that evening, and didn't   _   until Tuesday morning. As I drove into the drive, I realized something was   _  . Yes, my lawns had been mowed. I felt this huge   _   rush into my heart. I knew my   _  had done this for me.\nThis act of   _   not only made a big difference to me, but it also   _   me to act further in our community. Thank you so much neighbors.",
