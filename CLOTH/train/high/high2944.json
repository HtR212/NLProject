    "article": "While Christmas shopping in a jewelry store, I discovered a table of golden ornaments on sale. So beautiful in  _  ,each had a personality of its own. I looked through hundreds of pieces,  _  I was afraid that they would disappear among other  _  gifts of a Christmas tree,  _  I used them to decorate wreaths . When I stood back to  _  my work, a thought crossed my mind: Wouldn't some of our family and friends like these, too? I raced back to the jewelry store to discover that the piles of ornaments had been  _  even further. This time I bought dozens, as I  thought of  the many people who might enjoy one for the holidays. I  _  began my creative project. While I tied lovely bows and glued golden ornaments, my mind  _  to Christmases past, how special each had been. I thought about others perhaps not so  _  . Some people in our community  _  had a family to share the joy of Christmas. Some didn't  _  with holiday decorations. I nodded my head in determined  _  . They would be at the top of my list to receive a little wreath.  _  the plan my husband showed great enthusiasm and we set out together to put it into  _  . We visited the aged, the widowed and the lonely. Each one was  _  at our cheerful stop and  without delay  hung our small gifts -- often the  _  signs of celebration in their homes. After several days, I realized we had made and given almost two hundred wreaths. Decorated with  _  and delivered with delight, they filled many homes and hearts with the joy of Christmas. We were glad that our  _  did make sense and we found our Christmas spirit in doing and giving.",
