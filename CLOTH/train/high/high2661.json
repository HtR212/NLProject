Once outside, students broke into an easy jog toward the field until, all of a sudden, Marcus cried out, \"Look! What happened to the   _  ? It looks...angry.\"The students turned to see what he was pointing at all at once: Someone painted angry faces on the walls of the stadium!\nDuring lunch, all of the students were whispering with   _   about the graffiti  . Possible explanations spread like wildfire   _   the school.\nLater in the afternoon, when Brian cleaned the blackboard, Marcus suddenly   _   the paint on his hands. He   _   that it was Brian who painted the graffiti, so after school, Marcusfollowed Brian to his locker and   _   on what he was doing. When Brian opened his locker, Marcus saw small cans of paint in there! He decided to   _   it to Mr. Johnson.\nThe next morning, Brian was called to the principal's office. The moment Mr. Johnson asked   _   about the graffiti, tears started flowing down Brian's cheeks. Filled with shame, he explained that he liked to paint, but he couldn't join the   _   club because he had to go right home after school to baby-sit his little brother. \"I don't know why I painted those faces, and now I've   _   the stadium!\" he sobbed.\nMr. Johnson was quite angry at first, but he began to   _   as he realized how miserable Brian was. \"Brian, painting graffiti on school walls is a very   _  matter. We have to call your mother, and, of course, you will have to clean and   _   the walls.\" Mr. Johnson paused. \"  _  , I must say, those paintings are quite good. Did you have any   _   with them?\"\nBrian looked up and said,\"No, I did them myself. Drawing and painting are the only things that I can do well.\"\nMr. Johnson looked at Brian and thought for a moment before making a   _  . \"Well,\" he said, \"some teachers suggested that we hire a local   _   to paint our school mascot  on the stadium wall. How would you feel about participating in that?\"\n\"Really?\" Brian hesitated,   _   to believe what he just heard.\n\"Yes, but this project will be hard work, and you'll be expected to complete the job on time. We can consider it part of your   _  ,\" Mr. Johnson said, trying to hide his   _   as he picked up the phone.",
