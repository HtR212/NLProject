    "article": "I have been writing for more than 50 years.I still consider myself  _  to it, because I have written only one book.  _  , I have written thousands of letters, more than a hundred e-books and  _  millions of words on the Internet for hundreds of websites.\nThough I don't like foreign languages, I have also been  _  and have learned seven of them. I was  _  to study French, German and Latin for six years at school and Russian for four years at university, yet none of these was as  _  as writing a book of excellent  _  . And I am only talking about  _  here, not plot, although that is obviously  _  too.\nRules change in languages. The strict rules of the 19th century were largely  broken down  over the following 100 years. However, some rules  _  and that is how it should be too. Rules in writing are very important. And writing is a  _  thing and it involves languages, plots, reader's preferences, etc. So, who should  _  writing and book competitions? And what rules should they  _  ? Readers buy more books than writers and language experts put together. And writers write for readers, some of  _  might be other writers or teachers. Similarly there has to be a storyline or plot that is of  _  , but who should be the judge of that?\nThere is an author, John Locke, who sold a million books in five months, yet he was  _  for his style and content by experts,  _  surely he must have been doing something  _  . Currently, most writing competitions are judged by writers and this seems  _  to me. I suggest that if there are five judges, three should be readers, one should be a writer and one should be an English teacher.",
