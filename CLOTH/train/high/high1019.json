Eventually, I was shown letters from Mum,   _   that she was a drug addict. \nAll this was running through my head as I arrived in Glasgow on 27 December last year. My sister Leanne, from my mother's side, had    _   me down on Facebook, and we had been   _     for some time, but had met only once or twice. Leanne had been brought up by our mother's parents, and had some   _   with Mum throughout her life. She was now living in Canada, but returning for Christmas and    _   to see all the family together. A big party had been arranged to welcome her back, and everyone would be there, including our   _  .\nIn a very short time my sister and I hatched a   _  . I'd meet my sister as she arrived at Manchester airport, then we'd drive up to Glasgow   in secret  . Keeping it a surprise gave us a rush. After about a four-hour drive, we were there. I'd    _   called someone \"Mum\" before. But there she was.\nWe embraced   and although we could hardly get the words out fast enough, we were soon    chatting away  . Seeing someone so alike looking back at me was the strangest but most  _     experience. Though a lifetime may have  _  us, this woman at a party in Glasgow was my mum. She   _   at me for a second, before giving me a tight hug. All she could say was that she never thought we'd    _   again. \nShe'd been   _   of drugs for five years. She told me how she now works for a charity that helps young people   _    the same problems she had. We now talk regularly, and I feel  _     she's my mother. That's something I couldn't have even   _  when the door opened to her at that Christmas party. Life may be short, but it's always   _   enough to reconcile  .",
