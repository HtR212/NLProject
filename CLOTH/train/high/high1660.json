    "article": "One day in Israel government officials were rebuilding a barn . While working, they found a (n)  _  hole in a corner, so they used smoke to force the mice inside the hole to  come out  . A while later they indeed saw mice running out, one after another. Then, everyone thought that all the mice had  _  . But just as they were just about to start to clean up, they saw two mice squeezing out at the  _  of the hole. After some endeavor, the mice finally got out. But  _  , they did not run away immediately. Instead, one chased after the other near the exit of the hole. It seemed that one was trying to bite the  _  of the other. Everyone was puzzled, so they stepped  _  to take a look. They realized that one of the mice was  _  and could not see anything, and the other one was trying to allow the blind mouse to  _  on his tail so he could pull the blind one with him to escape. After witnessing what happened, everyone was  _  and lost in thought. During meal time, the group of people sat down and started to chat about what had happened to the two mice. One serious Rome official said, \"I think the relationship between those two mice was that of emperor and  _  .\" The others thought for a while and said, \"That was why !\"A smart Israeli said, \"I think their relationship was husband and wife.\" The others felt it made sense, so they  _  . A Korean, who was accustomed to the firm tradition of loyalty to  _  , said, \"I think the relationship between them was that of mother and son.\" Once again the others felt this was more reasonable, At that moment, one Samaritan who sat behind them resting his chin in his palms,  _  looked at other people, and asked, \"Why did those two mice have to have a certain relationship?\" Suddenly, the atmosphere froze. The group  looked back  at the Samaritan and remained silent. In fact, the true love is not established on benefit, friendship and loyalty or blood relationship. Instead, it is based on no relationship.",
