Do it all by yourselves. Think you boys can   _   it?\"\nDan and John were very proud. \"We can handle it,\" Dan   _  . \"We won't let you down.\"\nA few days before Christmas, Dan and John 25 _  in after school. They gathered the   _   they'd need and brought them out to the yard,   _   the tree waited. I was cooking when I heard the   _   sounds as the boys carried the tree into the living room. Then I heard the sound that every mother knows is   _  : dead silence. I hurried out to them only to find the tree was cut too   _  . John crossed his arms   _   across his chest and his eyes filled with tears. \nI felt worried. The tree was   _   to our holiday. I didn't want the boys to feel   _  every time they looked at it. I couldn't lower the ceiling, and I couldn't   _   the floor either. Suddenly, a thought came to my mind, which turned the   _   into the solution. \n\"We can't make the tree taller,\" I said. \"But we can put it on a   _   position.\"\nDan   _   his head. \"We could put it on the coffee table. It just might   _  ! Let's try it!\"\nWhen Bob got home and looked at the big tree on top of the coffee table, Dan and John held their   _  . \n\"What a good idea!\" he declared. \"Why didn't I ever   think of   such a thing?\"\nJohn broke into a grin  . Dan's chest swelled with pride.",
