The bicycle he wanted was at least $90!  _  on earth was he going to get the  _  of the money? He knew that his friends all had bicycles. It was  _  to hang around with people when you were the only one without wheels. He thought about what he could do. There was no  _  asking his parents, for he knew they had no money to  _  . There was only one way to get money, and that was to  _  it. He would have to find a job.  _  who would hire him and what could he do? He decided to ask Mr. Clay for advice, who usually had  _  on most things. \"Well, you can start right here,\" said Mr. Clay. \"My windows need cleaning and my car needs washing.\" That was the  _  of James's odd-job business. For three months he worked every day after finishing his homework. He was amazed by the  _  of jobs that people found for him to do. He took dogs and babies for walks, cleared out cupboards, and mended books. He lost count of the  _  of cars he washed and windows he cleaned, but the  _  increased and he knew that he would soon have  _  for the bicycle he longed for. The day  _  came when James counted his money and found $94.32. He  _  no time and went down to the shop to pick up the bicycle he wanted. He rode  _  home, looking forward to showing his new bicycle to his friends. It had been hard  _  for the money, but James knew that he valued his bicycle far more  _  he had bought it with his own money. He had  _  what he thought was impossible, and that was worth even more than the bicycle.",
