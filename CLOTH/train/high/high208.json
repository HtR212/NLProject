In fact  ,we had to borrow money to reach our destination town.Anyway,   it was my husband,two boys   _   four and two,and myself seven months pregnant,in an old Volvo station wagon.\n    We had been   _   for two days in the middle of winter,and we had taken a route that was very   _  .There was nothing around for miles-no cars,buildings or   _   of  civilization.Suddenly,our car started   _   power.\n    We saw a light in the distance and managed to roll to a   _   in front of this property that   looked   _  a small simple house.Our cell phones had not gotten reception for many miles, and it was   _   outside,so I didn't know if we were going to make   _   out of this situation alive.\n    My husband got out of the car to see   _  there was something he could do to get us   _    again,but it was not looking good.A short while later,a man came out of the house and     spoke with my husband a bit before   _  us all into his home.He and his wife took us in,fed     us,and made us   _  at home as we struggledtofind some   _  to get to our destination,which was still a few hours'drive   _  .We were able to call a friend and get a ride,  _   our broken car behind,but not before the couple gave us food and water for our   _  .\n    One week later,this dear sweet couple   _   our car all the way to our place and refused   to take   _   in return,except for us to pay it forward...and we will continue to do it forever.",
