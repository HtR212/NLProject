Ever since the day I got braces , I have thought about how  _  it would be for me to become an orthodontist and make other  _  like me have more beautiful smiles. The thought of helping other people overcome the fear of their  _  or self-esteem became so real to me the day that I got my  _  off two years later. After a long thought, I finally came to a(n)  _  that I wanted to do my senior exit project on orthodontics. I am in the  _  of doing my project now and I cannot wait to see the wonderful  _  that I'm going to achieve. In the long run, I know it will be a great  _  to me down the road, opening doors to my  _  path. Another goal in my life is to fly to new  _  and go where no one else has  _  to go before. I am a big leader at my school and I try to do new things that are  unheard of  in order to make things successful. I try to reach to the highest in order to make every event and idea  turn out  \"with a bang!\" I also want to do things to  _  the world somewhere down the road. After seeing friends go into  _  , I have thought about being a  _  missionary in a third world country for a couple of summers after I  _  from the high school. I think it would be  _  to impact the lives of powerless and torn people who need  _  that seems unimaginable to them. I think  _  more people reached out and conquered their dreams to help other people achieve theirs, this world would be a whole lot better of a place.",
