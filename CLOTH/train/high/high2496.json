    "article": "Annie, my neighbor's daughter, was away for her first term at college this year. She is a very sweet girl but just a bit shy. When her birthday month  came around  , I found out she was feeling a bit blue and  _  .\nHer family is quite  _  and finances are tight  , so there wouldn't be any birthday visitors.\nI wanted to send her a card and maybe a small gift to  _   her up. I got her school address from her mom and planned to  _   send her something. Then I got a(n)  _  !  I thought perhaps I could give her a big   _  . I bought some balloons, birthday hats and other small novelties   at a one-dollar  _  .  I took a small  _  and asked three other people in my area to sing Happy Birthday and send some birthday  _  to her. Other people found out  _   we were doing and added their voices,  _  it really sounded like we had a party  going on   .\nThen I bought her a small present and a card as  _   originally. The real fun was  _  it to be sent. I arranged everything specially so it was like opening a birthday present!\nAt the last minute, I added a pack of small cakes and a box of birthday  _  before sending it off.\nI got a call a few days later. Annie said her roommate and one of her neighbors in her school got together with her and held the party for her once it arrived. She sounded so  _  and I was so glad that she had some friends to  _   her special day with her.\nIt was such an easy and fun thing to do. The people who helped me make the tape still laughed and talked about the   _  experience. And Annie told me it was the most fun birthday she can   _  !",
