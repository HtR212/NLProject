    "article": "Lately I've been concerned about the environment. Last weekend I participated in the great Canadian shoreline   _  . On that day, my mother and I arrived at 9:30 a.m. More than fifty people   showed up   and all the volunteers were divided into groups.\nThe shoreline has four sections with the last two being the most   _   terrain --steep hills, lots of trees and rocks. We chose section four and after a brief speech from the organizer, we set off. We saw a lot of waste along the way, like newspapers, ropes, bottles, caps, bricks and cigarette ends.\n  In all  , we filled almost 30 bags with 160.5 kilos of garbage, including   _   1,000--1,200 cigarette ends. It was amazing how much we were able to   _  . I couldn't believe the   _   we made -- the shoreline looked clean!   _  , we had to leave the bricks as they would have broken our garbage and recycling bags! I did find one tire but it   _   so deep in the mud and dirt that I couldn't dig it out,   _   with the help of one of those metal rods.\n  Picking up   the waste was easy; it was trying to keep a record of everything we found that was the   _   part. We had a sheet with many categories   of items to   _  . It's great to get all   _   but it wasn't much fun for the volunteer stuck   _   recording all the information. Our purpose was to make the shoreline   _  , not to write lines and lines of what we have discovered.\nWe often hear some people   _   about their surroundings. If you are one of them, I'd like to say the only way to change things is by   _   rather than complaining. We need to teach by   _  . We can't blame others   _   we start with ourselves. I was very happy to make a small change by cleaning up a little bit of our shoreline.",
