    "article": "More than thirty years ago, I drove a cab for a living. I met people whose lives amazed me, made me   _   and weep. But none touched me more than a woman I   _   up late one August night. was responding to a call in a quiet part of town. When I arrived at 2:30 am, the building was   _   except for a single light in a ground floor window. I walked to the door and   _  .\nThe door opened. A small woman in her 80s   _   before me. By her side was a small suitcase. I took the suitcase to the   _  , and then returned to help the woman. She took my arm and we walked   _   toward the cab. She kept   _   me for my kindness. When we got in the cab, she gave me a(n)   _   and asked, \"Can you drive through downtown?\" \nFor the next two hours, we drove   _   the city. She showed me the building where she had    _   worked as an elevator operator. We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived   _   they were newlyweds. She   _   me pull up in front of a house that had once been a ballroom where she had gone   _   as a girl. Sometimes she'd ask me to slow in front of a particular building and would sit   _   into the darkness, saying nothing.\n                As the day   _  , we got to the address she had given me. It was a hospice  . Two orderlies came out to the cab as   _   as we pulled up. They must have been   _   her. I took the small suitcase to the door.\n\"You gave an old woman a little moment of   _  ,\"she said. \"Thank you.\" I squeezed her hand, then walked into the dim morning light. Behind me, a door shut. It was the sound of the   _   of a life. I didn't pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly, lost in thought.",
