Not only are students in China  _  from this problem, but kids in the United States are  _   fed up with heavy school bags.\nExperts are starting to   _  that more and more young students are having back and neck problems as a result of school bags  _   too heavy for them. \"It's hard for me to get up the  _  with my bag because it's so heavy,\" said Rich Hammond,   _  11-year-old student in the US. Rich is among the students who have 22 _ backpacks with two straps  to carry them,   _   a number of other students choose rolling backpacks. But even with rolling backpacks,  _  up stairs and buses with them is  _  a problem for kids. Many of them have hurt their knees, backs or necks because of heavy school bags.\nBut how much is too   _  ? Experts say students should carry  _  more than 10 to 15 percent of their own body weight. Scott Bautch, a Wisconsin   _  doctor, said kids under 4th grade should   _  with 10 percent. But it's also important that older kids don't go   _   15 percent, because their bones are still growing. Bautch explained that there are other injuries caused by backpacks. \"Kids are  _  their balance and falling down with these backpacks,\" he said.\nParents and teachers are starting to tell the kids to only take  _  library books they will be reading that night. Some teachers are using worksheets or  _  workbooks for students to take home.  One of the best answers is, as some  _  themselves suggested, to have no homework   at all  !",
