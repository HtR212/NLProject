    "article": "We experienced and unusual weekend last month! Early in the morning, we went to the country and spent a whole day  _  wild flowers.  _  the car full of  _  we were going home. On our way back, my wife  _  a bookshelf outside a furniture shop. \"Buy it,\" my wife said at once. \"We'll  _  it home on the roof-rack . I've always wanted one like that.\" Ten minutes  _  , we were back with the bookshelf in the flowers on the roof. In the gathering darkness I drove  _  . Other drivers seemed unusually  _  that evening. The  _  even stopped traffic to let us through. I had thought carrying furniture was a good idea. After a time my wife said, \" There's a long line of cars  _  . Why don't they overtake , I wonder?\" Just at that time a police car did  _  . The two officers inside looked at us seriously  _  they passed. But then, with a kind smile they asked us to  _  their car through the busy traffic. The police car stopped at our village church. One of the  _  came to me. \"Right, sir,\" he said, \"Do you need any more help?\" I was a bit  _  . \"Thanks, officer,\" I said. \"You have been very kind.\" He was staring at our car, first at the flowers, then at the bookshelf. \"Well, well,\" he said,  _  . \"It's a bookshelf you've got there! We thought it was something else.\" My wife began to laugh. Suddenly I understood  _  the police drove here. The truth  _  me. I smiled at the officer, \"Yes, it's a bookshelf,  _  thanks again.\" Then I  _  home as fast as I could.",
