    "article": "\"Kevin, we are getting a divorce,\" said my mother. My heart plunged. I was 9 years old and I thought that my life was going to  fall apart  . My brother and I were going to move with my mother to southern California. My dad was to  _  in New Jersey because of work. My family was splitting apart. Now that my mom is a single parent, I do my own  _  , make dinner and do extra chores around the house.  _  it was hard at first, I now recognize the positive  _  that this responsibility had on me. My mother gave me these chores and duties so that I would learn to become  _  and trustworthy. I strive to display these  _  in all aspects of my life, and have seen the benefits. When I was only 11 years old, my  _  told me that he was selecting me as soccer team captain because of my determination and ability to get my teammates to  _  themselves. We lost the championship, but I won the  _  play award for keeping my team together. I am always  _  to be an individual and not participate in anything that I feel is wrong. I am, for example, extremely proud of my decision not to drink alcohol.  _  , I don't feel the need to drink to have fun, and I stand by my decision even when others try to  _  me. My mom and dad both found new  _  and happily remarried. I am  _  close to my father, even though he lives 4,800 km away. I thought my parents' divorce was going to be the worst thing that  _  happened to me. Ironically , it turned out to be the  _  . I wasn't willing to let it ruin my life without putting up a fight, and  _  was my family. At age 9, I struggled with the confusion and  _  of divorce. Today, at age 16, I understand that  _  can bring opportunity and success, and that hard work, determination and self-control can turn your worst time into your best time.",
