    "article": "\"Ms Ashley, I want to be in your group!\" the statement that excited eight-year-old Skye had changed my life, as we boarded the bus last Friday. It was the big summer   _   to the Georgia Aquarium, and I had fallen victim to fifty hyperactive   kids. Although I was not   _   to chaperoning   field trips, riding on a school bus for three hours was a first.   _   by Game Boys, MP3 players, and fifty totally different   _  , I sat down with the noisy kids on the bus, the seven-and eight-year-olds. Having already built a   _   with most of the kids eased the   _  , but today a new kid, Skye, joined the group.\nSince I went to public school in the fifth grade, I've stood in an empty room of quiet walls.   _   in this room, I could withdraw from everything and no one   _  . Skye was the only one of the kids that was often labeled as the   _   child. If all the kids   _   me, Skye would be the one to oppose. I   _   it, but he pulled me out of my comfort zone without even   _   it.\nI realized my defining moment was created.   _   he kept the group away from me with his childish nature, his leadership   _   me. Everything he did pulled and   _   dragged me out of my lifelong corner. Skye   _   the seven-and eight-year-olds to drive me   _   that Friday, but one simple statement, \"Ms Ashley, I want to be in your group,\" turned the trip from a(n)   _   to a dream come true. That trip became the   _   one of my life.\nI have become someone who is not   _   to be a leader or voice the opinions that have laid within me for years, and Skye is the reason.",
