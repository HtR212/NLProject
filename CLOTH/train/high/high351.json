She told me that we had a very long history of friendship. The problem was that I'd44 _ met the lady before. Or at least I hadn't met her until one month ago.\nThose who45 _ to live here are the aged people of 55 and over since it is a \"retirement \"neighborhood. The day I moved here, the46 _ woman waved at me. I thought she was just being 47 _ .I kept an eye on the movers I'd employed while they were48 _ the furniture. The woman waved at us each time we made another49 _  to the truck. The movers and I heard her saying to no one but herself, \"I've 50 _ my friend.\" One day the gray--haired lady stood by the fence and 51 _ , \"Cordie! Where are you? Come out and talk to me, Cordie. \" I came to 52 _ that she was talking to me. So I went to the 53 _ and we talked. \"I'm so glad you've come to live here, Cordie. I've 54 _ you so much.\" \"And remind me of your name,\" I said. \"Don't you55 _ me, Coedie?\" she said as if I had56 _ her feelings. \"I'm Elizabeth. Don't you remember? You were my best friend when we lived in Terrell.\" \"Of course, I know you,\" I said.\nNow I am 65, but I'm still 57 _ . I exercise, work, cook, go out with my friends, and write books. As we are getting older, I believe sometimes we lose our 58 _  to remember things. However, it is unnecessary for me to make it 59 _ that I didn't know her. 60 _ , making friends is a good thing. And I've become her best friends since then.",
