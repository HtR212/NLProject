    "article": "This was my grandmother's first Christmas without grandfather, and before he passed away we had promised grandfather that we would make this her best Christmas ever. When my parents and I  _  at her house, we found she had waited up all night for us. The house did seem a little  _  without grandfather. Grandfather had always said that the Christmas  _  was the most important decoration of all. So we immediately set to work on the beautiful artificial tree that was stored in grandfather's closet . Through our efforts, we finally stepped back to  _  our handiwork. It looked beautiful.  _  something was missing. \"Where's your star?\" I asked. The star was my grandmother's favorite part of the tree. \"Why, it  _  be here somewhere,\" she said, starting to sort through the boxes again. \"Your grandfather always  _  everything so carefully when he took the tree down.\" As we emptied the boxes and  _  no star, my grandmother's eyes filled with tears. Grandfather had given it to grandmother some fifty years ago on their first Christmas together. It brought them great happiness. Now, on her first Christmas without him, the star was  _  , too. \"Don't worry, Grandmother,\" I  _  her. \"We'll find it for you.\" My mother and I formed a search  _  . \"Let's start in on the closet where the ornaments were,\" Mother said. \"Maybe the star just fell out of the box.\" That sounded  _  , so I began to search the closet. I thought I tried every  _  , but no star. I could see grandmother was  _  , although she tried not to show it. \"What's in this wrapped box?\" Mother suddenly called out. \"It was at the bottom of father's closet.\" Grandmother took the box in  _  and opened it. Her face  _  when she unfolded the paper and pulled out a golden star. There was a(n)  _  attached. Don't be angry with me, dear. I broke your star while packing the decorations, and I couldn't  _  to tell you. Thought it was time for a new one. I hope it brings you as much  _  as the first one. Merry Christmas! Love, Bryant So grandmother's tree had a star after all, a star that expressed their everlasting love for one another. And we were glad we were able to make this Christmas  _  for her.",
