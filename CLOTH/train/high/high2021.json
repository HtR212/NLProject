    "article": "It's a small gas station that has snacks, drinks, cigarettes, and candies. The young man behind the counter knows his  _  by name and what they normally want to buy. He treats children and adults with equal  _  . He reads science fiction behind the counter when business is  _  . One day, three people rushed in and grabbed food off the shelves as fast as they could,  _  not intending to pay for it. He hit the \"panic button\" , then went over the counter and  _  the front door. It was obvious that they were homeless, and equally obvious that they weren't going  _  with their illgotten gains. They  _  the food and simply crowded together in panic--knowing the police were  _  the way. Imagine what they must have felt like when they were told they didn't have to steal even if they were that  _  . \"We have food in the back, expired but still  _  to eat. If you need food, you  _  have some.\" They were told to  pick up  what they had dropped and put it back, and then asked to straighten out the mess. They were doing just that  _  the police arrived. The officers were told the situation was under control and the police were no longer  _  . This wasn't what they had  _  . They were being treated as human beings who could right the wrong they'd done. Shocked, they quickly followed orders to take turns and use the restroom to clean up. Soon three  _  people walked out with all the  _  their arms could hold. They were  _  that,if they needed to come back again, they were to ask and not just grab. And then the young man went back to read until the next customer came in. He would be the  _  person in the world to claim he was a hero. But he gave three people something they were in desperate need of--a  _  amount of selfrespect and a little bit of hope.",
