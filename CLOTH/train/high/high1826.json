    "article": "In my profession as an educator and health care provider, I have worked with numerous children infected with the virus that  _  AIDS. The relationships that I have had with these special kids have been  _  in my life. They have taught me so many things, but I have  _  learned that great courage can be found in the smallest of packages. Let me tell you about Tyler. Tyler was born  _  with HIV. From the  _  beginning of his life, he was  _  on medications to enable him to survive. When he was five, he had a  _  surgically inserted in a vein in his chest. This tube was connected to a pump, which he  _  in a small backpack on his back. Medications were hooked up to this pump and were  _  supplied through this tube to his bloodstream. At times, he also needed supplemented oxygen to support his  _  . Tyler wasn't willing to give up one single moment of his childhood to this  _  disease. It was not  _  to find him playing and racing around his backyard. Tyler's mom often teased him by telling him that he moved so fast she needed to dress him in  _  . That way, when she looked out of the window to check on him playing in the yard, she could quickly  _  him. This dreaded disease  _  wore down Tyler. He grew quite ill and, unfortunately,  _  did his HIV-infected mother. When it became apparent that he wasn't going to survive, Tyler's mom talked to him about death. She  _  him by telling Tyler that she was dying too, and that she would be with him soon  in heaven  . A few days before his death, Tyler asked me to his hospital bed and  _  , \"I might die soon. I'm not scared. When I die, please  _  me in red. Mom promised she's coming to heaven, too. I'll be playing when she gets there, and I want to make sure she can find me.\"",
