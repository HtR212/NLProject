I was shocked to see this and I was sad by the fact that he had to do this to   _  . I thought about putting bottles in a bag for him with a note attached   _   that the bag was for him to take,   _   then I thought it may not be the best idea from a safety standpoint. So I let it go.\nOne rainy day in the spring I saw him again riding his bike with bags of   _   attached to his backpack and handle-bars. My heart   _  . I felt powerless thinking I could never   _   with him. So you can imagine my   _   when I see him again. I walked over to him and managed to   _   a very quiet \"Hi\".\n  _  , I had never approached anyone like this before. His back was turned to me and he didn't   _  . I decided it was because he didn't want to be   _  . So I kept walking. And then I   _   the big bag of cans and bottles we had all collected from our west coast trip. \"He can have those!\" I thought and walked back over to him. I told him if he   _   there I could get him some more bottles. He said, \"That would be very much   _  .\" I came back in 5 minutes and there he was in the shade waiting. I handed the bag to him and   _   that it wasn't much. And then with another large bright   _   he said, \"Every little bit   _  . Thank you so much. And, have a great day.\" I wished him a great day as well and resumed my walk feeling a little   lighter   in my steps.\n[]\n,,,,,,,.",
