Your insights are very deep.As you say, \"death is only a(n)  _  but failure can change someone's whole life.\" Yes, death is final.Failure is  _  .Death leaves us with  _  .But failure can leave us with lessons which will  _  our lives. I hope that your failure to pass that  _  English test will help you  more than  it will hurt you.Please remember that it is not being  _  down that is important.It is the inability to get up that is  _  .You will have to learn to get up, and to get going.Failure is the \"staying down.\" It is not the \"falling down.\" From reading your letter, I  _  your English to be very good.You write better than  _  of my American friends.I do not know the reason for  _  your English test.Maybe you were distracted that day.It is  a shame  that persons are judged on the basis of a single test. You write well, you  _  your feelings with excellence, and you think  _  .These characteristics should  _  you move toward a bright career.Just don't let yourself \"stay down.\" Get up and  _  them all know that you are talented and you are  _  to succeed.I think you will. With best wishes for a fine career. Yours, Frank",
