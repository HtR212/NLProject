As they got  _  , Janet saw him sitting in his front yard and  _  they should cross over to the other side of the street. Janet was  _  of the strange old man because of the stories she'd heard about him. Amy said not to  _  . Still, Janet was growing more nervous with each step closer to the old man's house. When they got close enough, Dawson looked up with his usual frown .  _  when he saw it was Amy, a broad  _  changed his entire face as he said, \"Hello Miss Amy. I see you've got a little  _  with you today.\" Amy smiled back and told him Janet was staying  _  and they were going to listen to music and play games. Dawson said that sounded  _  , and gave them each a freshly picked  _  off his tree. When they  _  Dawson's house, Janet asked Amy, \"How come he was so  _  to us?\" Amy  _  that when she first started walking past his house he wasn't very  _  and she was afraid of him, but she  _  he was wearing an invisible smile and so she  _  smiled back at him. After some time, he started smiling real smiles and then started  _  to her. Now he always  _  her an apple, and was always very kind. Smiles are contagious . If you pretend he is smiling an invisible smile at you and you smile back at him,  sooner or later  he will really smile.",
