    "article": "Taylor Alison Swift, born December 13, 1989, is an American country music singer-songwriter. She is a beloved country star and superstar! Taylor Swift is typically the one to21 _ fans attending her concerts, bringing on stage various singers, actors and athletes as special guests.\n\"Taylor Swift would be a great motivational speaker,\"our 12-year-old daughter22 _ , having just attended a concert last weekend. I didn't go to the concert23 _ I asked her and her sister about what Taylor Swift24 _ during her three-hour performance.\nThe singer-songwriter talked about a number of25 _ : Being yourself and taking26 _ in that; being open to opportunities; being able to find comfort in those who27 _ you rather than getting into28 _ in the noise of those who turn against you; being able to get up and move forward after rejection;29 _ the opinions of others, especially30 _ we don't agree with them.\nI find these to be31 _ important thoughts to share with young people (and perhaps not so young). Taylor Swift is a superstar yet32 in spite of her fame and fortune, she seems to be a rather down-to-earth human being. In this day of millions of messages33 _ our ears, and being absorbed into our minds,34 _ the young developing minds of children and adolescents, it is a blessing to know that there are positively influential and35 _ voices out there like Taylor Swift's.\nSince the concert on Saturday, I have been thinking about Grandpa Peale and the influence his messages of36 _ attitude, respect for others, and care of oneself have had37 _ the world, messages that remain relevant today. I know he would have enjoyed speaking with Taylor Swift and learning from her. He would have38 _ her talents, her energy and her wisdom in using her39 _ as one of the best-known people in the entertainment world to positively40 _ lives through her spoken and sung messages.",
