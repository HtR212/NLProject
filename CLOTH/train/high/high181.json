    "article": "I first met Annie Mae, a maid  , at my parents-in-laws' in 1959. She prepared and       _  meals in her\nquiet, gentle way and then returned to the kitchen to read her Bible (<<>> ) while we   _  .\nShe was a devoted Christian. I found this increasingly true  even though  I came to know her more by observation than by conversation.\nMy husband and I   _  visited his parents. Each time I saw her eating  _  , reading her Bible, I wanted to sit down with her and\njust talk.  _  , whites didn't do\nthat with blacks then, and I had to  _  the practice.\nIn 1965, I decided to   _  the furniture and return to my home state with my two  _  when my husband wanted a divorce  .\nAnnie Mae asked if she could buy the boys'   _  . When I answered  _  ,\nshe asked the price. Then, she asked if she could  _  a little money each month. She was  _  , and I knew her well.\nThen each month, an envelope   _  us from Annie Mae with 2 or 3 dollars. A year passed. Annie\nMae's  _  payment arrived\nalong with the following note:\nDear Mrs. Holladay,\nI am sending you my last payment of three dollars for the beds   in full  . I\ntold my two sons they could now put the beds  _  and sleep in them, for they are now paid for and\nrightfully  belong to  us.Thank\nyou for your  _  .\nAnnie Mae\nI read the note two or three times, my eyes filled with tears. Had I only known earlier, I would have said, \"Use them now. Don't   _  until you pay\nfor them.\"",
