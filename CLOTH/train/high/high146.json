    "article": "After I left the United States Air Force,I began college classes in the summer of 1983.I pursued my nursing degree with effort and   _   it in grand style in May 1986 along with a lot of friends and fellow students.\nOf all my   _   professors,Dr Joan Cook had the most profound effect on me.She provided me with the stimulus to pursue my   _   beyond what the College of St.Mary could give me.In spite of   _   the same classes year in and year out,she put   _   into each class she was responsible for,and never   _   grew tired of her subject matter.\nOne day after class she pulled me   _   and said that she considered me one of her most\"unusual\"students who were able to walk a   _   road towards success.In my younger years I didn't   _   that being\"unusual\"would be such a tribute .As I   _   and gained a wider variety of life's   _  ,I found that being\"unusual\"takes on an array of meanings.After getting my nursing degree I   _   to Texas where I decided to   _   an additional degree in anthropology(the study of the human race)to my resume as that particular and interesting field   _   me far more than nursing ever did.\nI am exceedingly   _   to Dr Joan Cook for instilling in me the ability to see myself far beyond what other people   thought of   me.What she said motivated me to follow my dreams   _   gave me endless strength.Thank Dr Joan Cook,for I   _   her a great deal in establishing the solid   _   of whom I am and for the person whom I am trying to become.Without her it would have been   _   for me to become a professor in Harvard University.",
