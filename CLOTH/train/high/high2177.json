Not discouraged easily, I remembered  _  a lamp by the bed when I deposited my luggage  _  in the day.I found the bed in the  _  and then the lamp, but when I switched it on ,nothing  _  ! I thought that perhaps if I opened the curtains I might be able to use whatever light comes in from the  _  to find another lamp.So I  _  my way slowly across the room to the curtains and ...no drawstring! I finally stumbled around  _  I found a desk lamp which actually  _  ! That evening I discovered in a whole new way just how dark the world  _  be and how-necessary light is! But even more necessary than  _  light is the light that shines from people--the light of  _  and faith.Because, for many people, the world is a dark and  _  place.For someone today just may be stumbling in discouragement or sadness or fear and in  _  of some light.So let your light shine.Whatever light you  _  may be a beacon of hope and encouragement.And if you feel that your light is  no more than  a candle in a forest remember there isn't enough darkness in all the world to  put out  the light of one small candle.",
