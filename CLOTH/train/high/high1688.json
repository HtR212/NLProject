And we were enjoying every bite of ill-gotten berry  _  all of a sudden the Jordans' backyard lights were turned on. \"What you boys doing out here?\" Mr Jordan shouted. In all  _  ran off my friends, une aten raspberries  _  everywhere. He made an attempt to grab one or two, but they were too quick. Speed was never my  _  .

You can  _  deal with what happens to you.\" Back then I thought Dad just didn't  _  it. But through the years I come to realize that,  as usual  , he knew what he was talking about. We didn't come to earth with a(an)  _  that life would treat us fairly. The only thing we can actually deal with is what happens to us.",
