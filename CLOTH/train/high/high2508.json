    "article": "The Secret of Happiness An old man walked slowly into a restaurant with his cane . His  _  overcoat and worn-out shoes made him stand out from the usual Saturday morning breakfast crowd. A young waitress named Mary watched him move toward a  _  by the window. Mary ran over to him, and said, \"Here, Sir. Let me give you a hand with that  _  .\" Without  _  a word, he smiled and nodded a thank-you. She pulled the chair away from the table and helped him get seated  _  . In a soft, clear  _  he said, \"Thank you, Miss. And bless you for your  _  .\" \"You're welcome, Sir,\" she responded. \"I'll be  _  in a moment, and if you need anything in the meantime, just wave at me!\" After he had finished a  _  meal, Mary helped him up from his chair,  _  him his cane, and walked with him to the front door. Holding the door open for him, she said, \"Come back and see us, Sir!\" The old man  _  around and smiled. When Mary went to clean his table, she was  _  to find a business card, a one-hundred-dollar bill and a  _  which read, \"Dear Mary, I respect you very much, and you respect yourself too. It shows the way you treat others. You have found the secret of  _  ! Your kind gestures will shine through those who meet you.\" Actually the man she had served was the  _  of the restaurant. That was the first time that she or any of his employees had seen him.",
