I'm always  _  how sorrow and pain can bring such wonderful gifts as wisdom, patience and love.  _  , we often get so caught up in the daily necessities and routines that we  _  the very things that can bring us  _  and teach us many valuable lessons. I was hired to  care for  a very special lady. I was to prepare meals for her, make sure she took her medicine  _  , do light housekeeping, and provide transportation to and from the market and her doctor's appointments. All of these  _  were important and necessary so that she could remain  _  . Our focus was just that -  _  her to remain living independently. It was on a cold rainy night. She turned her little head and smelt her pillow after she had  _  got into bed. I observed tears running from her eyes. She said, \"It's been such a long time since I've had  _  sheets; I love the  _  of fresh clean sheets. I couldn't  _  the sheets myself anymore. Thank you so much for changing my sheets. \" Such a simple  _  as smelling clean sheets brought such great joy to her life. That was the day I  _  unconditional care. The next day we sat down and  talked about  what was important to her, what she liked, and how she had done things all these years. I never knew how much I would enjoy and learn from her  _  her life experiences with me. She was the sunshine in my life. I'm so  _  for the lessons I have learned - the lessons I almost  _  because I forgot to slow down to look and see the beauty that was right in front of me.",
