    "article": "I have been driving for over 30,years, but I can  _  remember what happened that day when I drove a car for the-first time.My mom had driven our big Plymouth to a  _  and deserted back road and parked it.\nThe road was only one lane and had a wall built with river rocks along the side of it  _  Mom knew there was little chance of meeting any  _  on it that day.With a smile, she gave me the key and   _  . seats with me.And then she told me to start the car, to petit into drive and to  _  push on the gas pedal.In my  _  , though, l miscalculated what \" gentle \"meant.After I pushed on the gas pedal, the car sped forward.  _  I could turn the wheel, I heard the ;scraping c) of metal  _  the stone wall.I stopped the car and looked over at my Mom.Her face was pale and her hand's were  _  .Slowly, she opened her  door   and started checking the car. Then she walked   _  around the car to the driver's side door.I kept waiting for her to  shout at  me but she just  _  and said, \"Well, that's enough for today. We'll try again tomorrow.\"\nAs I looked and  _  on that day. I am amazed at the amount of kindness, love and  _  my Mom showed me. In the years that followed, I  messed up  many times in many ways.Often I didn't feel worthy to be  _  , but each time I could feel Mom's gentle voice, \"We'll try  again tomorrow,\" When we fall today, don't  _  down.Rise up and be  _  to try again tomorrow.",
