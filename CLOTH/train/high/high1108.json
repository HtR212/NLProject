Mom said to Betty, \"You know things get broken or lost easily  _   they're not in good order.\" \"OK\" Betty said.\n   When Mum came back a few minutes   _   , all the toys and clothes had disappeared.\n   Mum was  _   , and asked Betty to get some pocket money out of her   _    in the tidy drawer. Betty went over,    _   it out and carried it over to the table. Betty found a bottle of red ink just like blood;  _  , there were some vampire   teeth, too. Betty felt very   _  , and asked her mom to dress her up as a vampire.\n   They  _  for a whole morning and then Mom said, \"But we still haven't found my purse.\"\n\"Well, you should put things in good  _  next time,\"  Betty said seriously. \"You are a clever monkey!\" Mom  _   and then asked \"But what should I do, dear?\"\n\"Do it like this. It's easy,\" Betty said, got  _  off the table into her arms, and then  _  them all back into the drawer. Mom looked at Betty  _  and said, \"Are you sure you have put your things in order? Let's have a   _   again.\"\nBetty followed   _   into the room. Then they heard the cat's sound. Mom bent down and   _  the bedcover to see if it was there.   _   the bed were Betty's toys, clothes and many other things.\n               \"Betty! How would you   _  this?\nBetty's face became red and could say nothing.",
