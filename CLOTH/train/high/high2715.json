    "article": "One day I met a man in the hospital, who needed blood to save his daughter. He was struggling to get blood for her and curiously  _  my blood type. My blood type was the same needed for his daughter. Before that I  _  donated my blood, so I was afraid of doing this and didn't know what to do. Then suddenly I saw a little girl in the hospital, who was  _  from a critical disease and needed blood from her six-year-old brother. Yes, from her younger brother, why? His brother had  _  suffered with the same disease and by God's kindness  _  by developing the anti-bodies needed to fight for the disease. The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the boy if he would be  _  to give his blood to his sister. I saw him  _  for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, \"Yes, I'll do it if it will save my sister.\" As the transfusion progressed, he smiled, seeing the  _  returning to her sister's cheeks. But suddenly, his face grew pale and his  _  faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a  _  voice, \"Am I going to die?\" Being young, the boy had  _  the doctor; he thought he was going to give her all his blood and  _  his life. I felt  _  , when that young boy,  _  the fact of blood donation, got ready to give his blood, thinking that he will lose his life but save his sister's life. And I, being a mature person, knowing that this will not  _  my life, I will not lose my life,  _  save others' lives and I was hesitant of doing this. That moment  _  my thoughts and I became enthusiastic about doing this important duty and felt that true  _  by helping save that little girl's life. If any patient dies due to a blood shortage, I will not call this the  _  of doctors, as science is still not able to make blood artificially. Only we can save others' lives  _  donating blood.",
