    "article": "Talking with Notebooks\nI had been going through a tough time dealing with the problems of growing up and communicating with my mother. Whenever I got angry, we would end up in  _  with each other,\nunwilling to share our real feelings.\nSeveral days ago I ran away from home to  _  the anger and pain bottled up  _  me.\nI stayed away for many hours, well into the night, before I finally decided to  _  home. Walking through the front  _  , I immediately saw all the  _  and anger on my mother's face. For days after that, we said the  _  . Everything we did was filled with tension,  _  we\ndesperately needed a talk and agreed to have breakfast together in a local cafe\nthe next morning. It turned out to be a  _  point of\nour relationship.\nOn our way to the table I   _  my mother having two notebooks and some pens, \"  _  are\nthey for?\" I asked, \"Sometimes it is easier to write down our feelings than to  _  about them.\" She explained. She then  _  me a notebook\nand kept one for herself. The \"  _  \" were that she would pick\na topic, and we would write down our  _  about it,\nhowever long or short. Our first  _  was: \"Why I am so\nangry.\" I wrote a half page, and mum  _  up nearly three\npages. Tears streamed down her face as she wrote.\nAfter finishing writing we  _  our notebooks and read what the other had written. On starting\nreading mum's words, I began to cry and so did she. Amazingly enough, when we\nfinished discussing them, all the anger inside me was  _    .\nI gained a special gift that day at the restaurant. Mum and I continue to use our notebooks as a   _  of communicating our problems. No matter how we feel, our notebooks are a\nsafe place to express it.",
