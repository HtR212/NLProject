The country  _  seemed to be going on forever, and the farther we traveled, the worse it seemed to get. Finally we  _  a truck stop. So we pulled in and I got out of the car for  _  \"Does anybody here know how to find Merridale Road?\" I asked. A very tired waitress looked up and said, \"Lady, I haven't got a clue.\" Since she was not  _  , I looked around at the customers.There,sitting nearby, were four of the toughest men I had ever seen in my life.
