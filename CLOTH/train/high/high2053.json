About 10 days ago I went to bed very  _  . I had been up  _  for important letters from the White House for a long time. I could\nnot have been  _  in bed when I fell into sleep.\nI soon began to  _  . There seemed to be a dead silence\nabout me. Then I heard sobs ,  as if   a number of people were weeping. I thought I left my bed and   _  downstairs.\nThere the silence was broken by some pitiful  sobbing, but the mourners were   out of sight  .I went from room to room,\nno living person was in sight; but the same mournful sounds of distress  met me as I   _  along.\nIt was light in all the rooms;  everything  was well known to me,but   _  were all\nthe people who were sobbing as if their hearts would  break  ?\nI was puzzled and frightened. What could be the  _  of\nall this? I kept on walking until I arrived at the East Room, which I  _  . Before me was a dead body. Around it were soldiers who were acting as  _  ; there were some people  _  pitifully. ''Who\nis dead in the White House?\" I asked.\n\"The president,\" was the answer.\n\"It's   _  !\"I said to myself and was surprised. How did he die?\"\n\"He was killed by an assassinator  !\" was the answer.\n\"  _  came a loud burst of crying from the crowd,which woke me from my dream. I slept   no more  that night, and although it was  _  a dream I have\nbeen rather angry about it  ever since  .\"",
