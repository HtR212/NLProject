Sinister but good people, they are after nothing but    _  , will not help me.\"\nHearing that, the God said: \"Would you like to   _  the treatment? \n\"I should, of course! But   _  for me to climb over the pond, the water  dried up  .\"\nGod listened to the leprosy patient, then after a little   _  , ask him once: \"Don't you want to be cured in the end?\nHe said: \"Yes!\"\nGod   _  : \"Well, you now stand up to  _   to the pool, do not always find some reasons that can not be   _   for their own defense.\"\nUpon hearing this, the leprosy patient was deeply  _   and immediately stood up and went to the water edge, containing the heart of God with his hands a few water to  _   . Twinkling of an eye, his   _  for nearly 40 years of leprosy paid off!\nEveryone has an ideal, the success of everyone. However, if you have not yet reached the  _  , the success of far-fetched, do you   _  yourself: I pay for their own ideals and how much effort? I was not always finding a(n)  _  for a lot of failure for my own sophistry? In fact, We should not make excuses for failure. We should find a  _  to success, As long as you have made the efforts to development, the fate will always   _  you.",
