All I could  _  were two pleasantly fat cheeks and a little nose. \"\n\"And I looked like a tiny fairy baby?\" she asks.\n\"You did,\" I always answer. \"The nurse  _  a tiny girl to me, and I was so surprised because you felt so  _  . I thought that if I opened the  _  , I'd find no baby there at all,  _  air.\"\nIn that instant, I became a  _  . I was all  _  in a cold room with a stone floor, four thousand miles from home. There was no sterile  hospital room, no crying husband----just the two of us. But that moment was just as special, just as magical as if she'd come from my body  _  into my arms. She was my daughter in every way that  _  from that moment.\nI  _  my life to a woman I've never met, who lives half a world away. Her  _  gave me all I could ever ask for, and I never forget for a moment that it was her  _  decision ---- her tears and her pain ---- that is the foundation on which I've built this life love.\nAs my daughter grows, she'll understand that sometimes life is a  _  , and you never know who in this world will hand you your baton . It could be someone you've never  _  , someone who lives a world away, someone you'll never be able to repay for giving you the life you always wanted  _  never dared to imagine you'd have.\nI believe the true gifts of our lives come from the most  _  of sources. If we go forward bravely with our  _  open, we will always be in the right place to receive them.",
