    "article": "As a teacher, I think all students were dear to me, especially Mark.\nMark was very talkative, I had to  _  him repeatedly that talking without  _  was not acceptable. Every time I had to correct him for misbehaving. \" Thank you for correcting me, Sister!\"  Before long  I became accustomed to hearing it many times a day.\nOnce my  _  was running out when Mark talked again, I  tore off  two pieces of tape  and made a big X with them over his mouth. When I  _  the tape, he still thanked me for correcting him.\nOne Friday, I asked the students to  _  the names of the other students on two pieces, leaving a  _  between each name, and then write down the  _  thing they should say about others.\nThen I  _  all the lists and gave each student his or her list. Soon the entire class was smiling. \" I never knew that  _  anything to anyone!\" \" I didn't know  _  liked me so much!\" Mark said, \"Thank you for keeping me  _  , Sister.\"\nLater Mark joined the army and was  _  in   Vietnam. After the funeral , his father showed me something  _  on Mark. It was pieces of notebook paper that had  _  been taped and folded many times, on which were the good things that Mark's classmates had said about him. His mother said that he behaved better and better  because of  my list.\nMark's classmates told me that they kept their own lists in  _  ways. Hearing this , I finally cried.\nSometimes the  _  things could mean the most to others. We forget when life will end. So  _  the people you love and care about, before it is too late.",
