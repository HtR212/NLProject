I was scared of  _  and couldn't even climb a tall ladder  . How would jump out of an aeroplane from a thousand meters   _  ?\nBefore I  _  my first jump, I did a few hours of training,  _  how to leave the aeroplane, how to  _  the parachute, and how to land safely. Then it was time to put the parachute on and  get into  the plane. I was terrified! But I wanted to see  _   I could do it.\nThe plane went up and up. I  _   sicker and sicker. When it was my turn, I was numb with fear, but I did  _   I had to. I put my leg out of the aeroplane  _  . I looked back at my  _  and when he said \"go\", I   _  . I should have   _  the seconds, but I forgot to. I held my hands and legs out wide, just as I had been taught to do. I was falling and falling and falling. It was  _  . My eyes were open but I couldn't   _  . My ears were  _  but I couldn't hear. All I could feel was that I was falling and falling.\nMy parachute had opened.
