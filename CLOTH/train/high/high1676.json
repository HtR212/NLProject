    "article": "It was a typical Wednesday. My wife and I were speaking in a nursing home about our successful recoveries from our heart attacks. Afterwards, one of the other residents , Miriam, asked if we had a few minutes to talk. \"I've always thought that to be  _  I need three things: someone to  _  , something to do and something to look forward to,\" she said. \"I've got people here to love, and the activities to  _  me as busy as I want, but I don't have anything I'm looking forward to. Do you have any  _  ?\" \"What did you look forward to before you came here?\" we asked. \"Oh, I used to love to laugh with others,\" Miriam said. \"What did you  _  about?\" we asked. \"Everything I could see, hear, feel, taste or smell,\" she said with a smile. At that very moment, we got the idea to start our  _  . We began looking for humor, and we used all of our  _  .We started with a teabag with the  _  : You are like this teabag... only in hot water do you realize how strong you are. We continued  _  and found cartoons and videos filled with humor. People brought us stickers, books, games and magazines. We  _  together humor baskets with books, tapes, greeting cards and toys for children of all ages. Of course, we  _  a humor basket for Miriam, the woman who had  _  us on this project - \"Search for a Smile and Share it\". She told us that the  _  of her day was sharing the  _  of her basket with everyone she saw. The project was so  _  that other facilities heard of it and made special  _  . One nursing home asked us to make a humor cart, like a shopping cart. Volunteers  _  this down the hallways, sharing smiles and laughs with  _  . Still another nursing home requested that we  _  a humor room, complete with a projector showing fun videos. What started as a simple gesture to  _  one elderly woman turned into a lifetime project.",
