    "article": "It was a lazy morning during the Christmas week. We were enjoying breakfast when the doorbell rang. It was a little girl, standing at the doorway with a piece of paper and a face that carried an expression of want, rather a common  _  during Christmas. She murmured that the paper was her booklist and that she was going around  _  money to buy her schoolbooks. My children went inside and brought some  _  for her. This kind of incident happens very often in my hometown,  _  during Christmas. From where I was seated, I could see her clearly. She looked about ten years old and she wore a dress too big for her. She spoke in a  _  voice and looked at me straight in the eye. Something made me get up and  speak to  her. In answer to my questions, she said that her mother made hoppers and she  _  them before going to school. But the hopper money was not adequate to  _  the list; therefore, she was going from house to house asking for help. Her voice told me the story; her eyes told me that it was  _  . I said I'd buy her what was on the list. We drove to a nearby bookstore. She sat  _  , with a strange look on her face. When the clerk was taking all the things on the list, the little girl kept staring as if confused. Perhaps she had never  _  so many new things before. They were merely exercise books, pencils, pens and such things. She whispered her  thanks  to us. Strange, I hadn't been aware that giving such  _  things to one in need, could bring me such a lot of happiness. As we drove back, I could see the little girl in the mirror. All the gifts I had given in my life never  _  up a face so much. She was grasping the parcel, smiling to herself. The total event made us all very  _  . Our Christmas became more meaningful.",
