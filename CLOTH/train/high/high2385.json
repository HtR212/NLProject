    "article": "My name is Amy. I'm a 25-year-old graduate student who likes yoga, home-decorating shows and eating spoonfuls of peanut butter  _  from the jar. Oh yeah, and I'm an iPhone addict. I wasn't always an addict. In fact, for many years I told myself I didn't want a  _  cellphone. They seemed like too much work, always beeping, ringing and  _  attention. I was  _  content with my simple antique (,), and I didn't expect to change my mind any time soon. However, about a year ago, I found myself envious of all those proud iPhone owners, cradling their shiny new phones and  showing them off to  all their friends. I started listening secretly to conversations about \"iPhone apps\", feeling like a  _  listening to a language I couldn't speak. Eventually I couldn't  _  my iPhone instinct any longer, and I welcomed my new iPhone into my life. To my surprise, I suddenly found myself with a whole new circle of friends. They  responded to  my iPhone-related inquiries when my other friends couldn't, and didn't  roll their eyes  when I bragged about all the things little Eloise (yes, I named her) could do. However, I realized I had a problem when one day I found myself Google-mapping my way to my mailbox, which happens to be right outside my front door. When I  reflect upon  the past few months, I couldn't believe I didn't see this coming. All the  _  signs were there. Eloise slept right beside me and was the first thing I  reached for  in the morning. I  _  my e-mail about 20 times a day. I also experienced  _  when I left poor Eloise in the change room at the gym.  What if  she beeped and needed my response? Okay, so I was addicted to my iPhone. I decided  _  had to be done. But, as I quickly realized, iPhones are like  _  and not easy to quit. Then, while taking the bus to work one day, I was  _  forced to quit--at least  _  . When I reached into my purse to grab Eloise, (to refer to my e-mail for only the seventh time that morning), I found her  _  by fever. She was so hot that I dropped her immediately back into my bag. When I picked her up again, she was gone.",
