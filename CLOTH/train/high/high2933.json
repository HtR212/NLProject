    "article": "Dad is a reserved man of few words but is always strict. What's more, he is quite different from others in ideas and  _  : beating or bringing to account his son in the presence of neighbors as he strongly believes in such a  _  : a dutiful son is the  _  of the rod, which is deeply impressed in his mind from his father. So I was emotionally upset and  _  in spite of just a 10-year-old kid, who thought, \"I was randomly beaten, so I would bring blows on other smaller kids\". And Dad would deal me a heavier  _  the next time.\nIt  turned out  that I completely lost control of this blow and found it impossible for me to  _  on my lessons as I came to blows with other kids all day long. Everything went from bad to worse for me so much  so that  I couldn't write out the English alphabet,  _  could I do arithmetic  .  To make matters worse  , I was sent into a reformatory school  where I stayed guilty for two and a half years. This time Dad shed bitter tears, saying, \"Son, it is not that I don't love you but that I should not have been so angry at your failure to  live up to  my expectations!\"\nRetiring from the army, he gave me 10,000 US dollars for a trip around the world.  _  getting back from this trip, he said to me, \"Book knowledge is  _  valuable but he who travels far and wide should know better at the time of your life. I guess you are now fully prepared to get started for work.\" At 26, I started up Runhua Machinery Co., Ltd., which was later poorly  _  and went bankrupt ; it was not long  _  I started to engage in a dye-stuff plant which happened to be blown up. At all these, my father only gave me such words, \"I will congratulate you on your god-given setbacks and failures, which will help you make  _  mistakes in life.\"\nThe Ph.D. graduation ceremony was grandly started and my parents were  _  invited to  show up  . Dad didn't say a single word  in praise of  me but cried bitterly again this time, and at this very moment, my mind was in a state of  _  emotions and I stood on the stage with warm tears in my eyes.",
