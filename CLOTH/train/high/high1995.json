    "article": "The day was Thankful Thursday, our \" regular day\" of service. It's a  _  tradition that my two little girls and I began years ago. On this  _  Thursday, we had no idea exactly what we were going to do.  _  along a busy road, we prayed for guidance in search of  _  our weekly Act of Kindness. My girls were  _  , and started shouting \" McDonald's\" . Suddenly I realized that almost every crossing I  passed through  was occupied by a beggar, and then it hit me! All these beggars must be hungry. Perfect! We were going to buy  _  for them. It was a great way to  _  . The Act of Kindness was anonymous ,and we loved what we saw in the back view mirror: a  _  and delighted person holding up his lunch bag and just looking at us  _  we drove off. We had come to the end of our \" route\" where there was a small woman standing there, asking for  _  . We handed her our final lunch bag, and then made a U-turn to head back in the opposite direction for home. Unfortunately, the light stopped us. I was  _  and didn't know quite how to behave. \"No one has ever done anything like this for me before,\" the woman said with  _  . I replied, \"Well, I'm glad that we were the first one.\"  _  uneasy , and wanting to move the conversation along, I asked, \"So, when do you think you'll eat your lunch?\" \"Oh honey, I'm not going to  _  this lunch.\" I was confused , and she continued , \"I have a little girl of my own at home and she just  _  McDonald's , but I can never buy it for her because I just don't have the  _  . You know what... tonight she is going to have McDonald's !\" So many times I had  _  whether our Acts of Kindness were too small or insignificant to really  _  any difference . Yet in that moment, I recognized the  _  of Mother Teresa's words, \"We cannot do great things---only small things with great love.\"",
