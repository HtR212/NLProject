    "article": "A friend of mine was sitting in the living room one day when his cat dragged in a little \"gift\" in its mouth--a dead animal of some sort. Taking a closer look, he was surprised to  _  it as the bunny that  belonged to  Mary, the young daughter of the family next door. My friend felt  _  , believing his cat had killed Mary's bunny. My quick-thinking friend came up with a plan.  _  from the cat's mouth the dead animal, which by now was a  _  mess, he put it in the kitchen sink. With a little warm water and some shampoo, he tried to  clean up  the dead bunny as best he could. Then he took a hair dryer and blowdried the bunny  _  it looked pretty good. Finally, under the cover of darkness, he crept into the next-door garden and placed it  _  in the cage. He managed to make the bunny look very  _  there in his little box. The next morning, my friend looked out of the window and noticed a crowd of people  _  around the rabbit hutch . Everyone seemed to be talking and pointing. My friend  _  to go over and act like any normal  _  neighbor and find out what was going on. When he got there, Mary's mother said to my friend, \"You won't believe this! It's a(n)  _  thing! Mary's bunny  passed away  a few days ago, and we buried that little bunny right over there...\" Have you ever tried to cover up one wrongdoing with another? Covering up only makes matters  _  . When we get caught doing something  _  , for example, we may  _  to cover it up with a lie. But just like Mary's bunny, the result is  _  what we expected. We  end up  looking foolish. We would have been better off admitting we were wrong and accepting the  _  . What do you think of it?",
