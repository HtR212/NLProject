    "article": "Rolling, dark clouds covered much of the sky. The warm wind suddenly became cold and picked up wildly, sending some dead leaves flying   _  across the sky. A few drops of rain mixed with ice began to fall, then into heavy   _  .\nDoug, my older brother, and I first rode the bus to a bus stop. Then we   _  off and began our long walk home. The wind was   _  the snow around us like a huge blanket, making it   _   to see clearly. The only sounds we heard were the   _  of the wind as well as the crunch of our footsteps on the snow. Slowly but   _  , my brother and I were  _  to death. Looking to my left, I saw a pine tree and squatted down.\n\"What are you doing here, Bud? Come on!\" said Doug, \" There's no  _  behind this little tree. If we rest here, we will die from the freeze.\"\n\"You go on, and I'll  catch up  soon.\" I replied.\nDoug was   _   for a moment. Then he spoke, \"Bud, do you remember the four pine trees at the side of the road?   _  we get there, we can rest a while and get warm. You just stick your hand down the back of my   _  , keep your head down and hold on.\"\nAs we struggled through the snow, my hand  _  from my brother's belt and I fell to my knees.\n\"Where are the trees?\" I said, as the snow  _  up around me like a feather bed. Once again, Doug pulled me to my feet.\n\"Just a few more  _  and we'll be home and warm,\" he said.\nAs the darkness closed around us, we approached home,   _  . I only heard a worried shouting not in the distance. Then someone took my hand and  _  me into a warm, bright light. And then I survived.\nNow, I still think about the lesson learned from our winter  _  story: Never  give up  , no matter what will happen.",
