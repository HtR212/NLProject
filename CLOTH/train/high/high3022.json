    "article": "My mother is a geneticist, and from her I learned that despite our differences in size, shape and color, we humans are 99.9 percent the same. It is in our  _  to see differences: skin, hair and eye color, height, language. But also in our nature, way down in the DNA that  _  us human, we are almost the  _  . I believe there is more that unites us than  _  us. My mother came to the US from India. She is  _  enough that she got her service  turned down  in a diner in 1960s Dallas. My father is a white boy from Indiana whose  _  came from Germany in the mid-1800s. It seems  _  to admit now, but I never  _  that my parents were different colors. One day, I watched my parents walk  _  the street of our church together. They were  _  in the service that day, and as they walked, I saw their hands  _  together in unison . I noticed for the first time how dark my mother was, and how white my father was. I knew them as my parents  _  I realized their skin color. I'm sorry to say that now when I see a mixed-race  _  walking down the street, I see the \"mixed race\" first and the \"couple\" second. When my parents married in 1966, there were  _  places in this country that had laws  _  mixed marriage.  _  , my white grandfather,  _  father had been a typical racist, was not against their marriage. Some of us are men, some are women. Some are young, some old. Some of us are short and others  _  . Some right-handed, some left-handed. We have lots of differences; we are all  _  . But deep down inside us, down in our DNA, we are 99.9 percent the same. And I believe we need to remember that.",
