He kept them in a large, fenced pen(  ) in his   _   .\nOne morning he   _  a little bulldog ( ) running down the path behind his home. It saw the two dogs and squeezed under the fence. The man thought he should perhaps   lock up  the setters so they wouldn't hurt the little dog, but   changed  his mind. Maybe they would teach that bulldog   a lesson   he thought.\nAs he   _  , fur began to fly, and all of it was bulldog fur. The bulldog soon had enough and   got away  .\nTo the man' s   _  , the incident was repeated the following day with the   _  results.\nThe man left early the next morning   _  a business trip and returned after several weeks. He asked his wife what finally   happened  to the bulldog.\n\"You won't   _  it, \"she replied. \"At the same time every day that little dog came to the backyard and   fought with  our setters. He never   _   a day! Now when our setters hear him barking down the   _  , they ran down into the basement. Then the little bulldog walks around our backyard   as if  he owned it. \"\nHow do you manage those problems you   come across  daily?
