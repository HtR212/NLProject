    "article": "I had a job interview this morning at 10:30 in a place which was quite far from my house. I had asked my brother to  _  me at the bus stop. But he was running late and it was already 9:45 before I reached the bus stop.  _  , I caught my first bus and had to wait at another stop for the second one. Then, in front of my  _  , a little girl (who may have been a beggar) was hit by a car!The car drove off without  _  . The girl was badly hurt in her hands and legs. She was  _  heavily and was screaming in pain. After a few seconds she fainted . People standing nearby didn't seem to know  _  to do. I ran over and called for an auto. A  _  , who seemed to be the girl's grandpa, ran towards us with  _  steaming down his cheeks. I took them both to  _  in the auto. They admitted the girl and  _  to start her treatment. Happily, she was well  looked after  and soon came back to consciousness. She smiled at me and hugged her grandpa. I  _  the bill, gave them a little money, then I  set off  for my interview. It was 1:30p.m. Before I got home. I was  _  hours late! The one interview who was still there asked what had  _  me. I told him, and then gave him one of our Smile cards and  _  about the project. He was very impressed! It would be  _  to say I got the job.  _  , because I was so late he could not pass me on to the next level. Getting the job might have made me happy, but helping that young girl and her grandpa made me even  _  ! I really thank God for giving me that  _  to help.",
