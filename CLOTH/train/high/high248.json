Written on the   _  were\nthe words, \"To my grandson.\"  _  it was his\ngrandfather's handwriting, the boy opened the envelope. A letter inside read:\nDear Ronny,\n       Years ago you   _  to me for help. You said, \"Grandpa,\nhow is it that you've  _  so much in your life? You're still\nfull of  _  , but I'm already tired of struggling. How can I\nget that same enthusiasm that you've got?\"\n       I didn't know what to say to you then. But knowing my days are   _  ,\nI figure that I  _  you an answer. So here is what I\nbelieve.\n       I think it has something to   _  with how a person looks\nat things. I call it 'keeping your eyes wide open\".\n       First, realize that life is filled with surprises, but many are good ones. If you don't keep  _  for them, you'll miss half the excitement.\nExpect to be excited  once in a while  , and you will be.\n       When you meet with  _  , welcome them. They'll leave you wiser,\nstronger, and more capable than you were the day before. When you make a\nmistake, be  _  for the things it taught you. Learn to use\nthat lesson to help you reach your goals.\n       It's also important to  _  exactly what you want. Then keep your\nmind focused on it, and be prepared to receive it.\n       As you grow with the years, you'll be given bigger shoes to fill. So be ready for endings as well as challenging   _  .\n       Sometimes we have to be brave enough to move from the familiar to the unfamiliar. Life isn't just reaching peaks. Part of it is moving from one  _  to\nthe next. If you  _  too long in between, you might be\ntempted to  _  . So consider all the pathways ahead, and\ndecide which ones to  _  . Then believe in yourself, get up,\nand get going.\n       Most important of all, never give up on yourself. The person that ends up a winner is the one who resolves to  _  . Give life everything you've\ngot, and life will give its best  _  to you.",
