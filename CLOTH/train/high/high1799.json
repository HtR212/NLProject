    "article": "Cody was an outgoing black dog with a big tail. Our dog Tasha was a similar spirit.  _  she shared the yard with Cody, they soon became fast friends.\nWe often saw a ball of black and white fur as they  _  neck and neck toward some unlucky bird that had just landed in the yard. The only time I saw any  _  between them was when we fed Tasha. Cody would jump up,  _  to share. However, Tasha would bare her teeth and shout  _  . Finally, Cody would slip away with his tail between her legs.\nOne day my husband came home quite  _  . He had just found Cody  _  by the side of the road, killed by a speeding truck. Tasha cleaned Cody's smooth  _  fur with her nose and mouth and whined . Over the next few weeks, Tasha was in low  _  with her tail between her legs. She  _  missed her old friend.\nAt the same time, Tasha's food dish disappeared. We replaced it with another,  _  to have that one disappear as well. There  _  bowls, plates, even an old coffee can. They all disappeared. Finally, the  _  was solved when our neighbor knocked on our door, her arms loaded with the missing dishes, some still half-full of dog  _  .\n\"Are these yours?\" she asked. \"I saw Tasha headed toward the  _  , so I followed her. Then I noticed all these dishes in a pile.\"\n  _  , I asked, \"Where were they?\"\n\"It was right by the place where Cody  _  .\"\nCould Tasha have been begging her old friend back by offering him the one thing she  _  to give him when he was alive?\nEven today,  _  the story makes me feel sad. It  _  me that I need to share whatever blessings I've received with others -- before it's too late.",
