But, say  _  , and they'll think you weren't friendly. So,  _  can you talk with adults? It's  _  . Just ask them questions about themselves. \"Many of them like to talk about what they do for a living,\" suggests psychologist Tim Ursiny. Kids can also talk to grown-ups about  _  . Ask what the last good movie they saw was, because people at dinner parties \"  light up  \" when the conversation turns to movies, Ursiny says. If a grown-up is  _  Harry Potter, it's OK to talk about your love for Harry. It's a(n)  _  topic, one that both grown-ups and kids can enjoy, so  go ahead  and talk about whether Dumbledore is really dead. But  _  the topic of video games. \"Adults don't want to hear about your video game  _  they play it,\" Ursiny explains. Adults also don't want to hear slang . Don't use language they don't  _  . Ursiny says kids should learn to speak to other people in their own language.  _  most adults aren't into slang, they do remember what it was like to be a kid. Ursiny recommends asking adults what  _  was like when they were your age. \"It might be a fun discussion if you  _  your 10th-grade experience with theirs.\"  Make sure  you chat with your parents in advance to find out which topics are off-limits . Also, don't chat about the things that make your parents feel guilty. Don't mention  _  stuff such as how Dad has been sleeping on the couch, Ursiny says. And don't complain that Mom has been late preparing breakfast.  _  , Ursiny says, kids should try to put themselves in their parents'  _  . Learning how to  _  that type of understanding might help you out in the future. \"The most successful people can develop a sympathetic feeling for others,\" he says.",
