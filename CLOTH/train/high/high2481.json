Even if  you're unaware of them, they know you're  there. Robots are monitoring  _  in hospitals, providing banking services,  _  people from burning buildings and assisting astronauts in  _  . Robots are everywhere. \nAre robots  _  or deadly enemies? Robotic expert Hans Moravec says intelligent robots today are no smarter than the average insect. But, don't feel too  _  about that. For example, army ants in South America  _  everything in their path when they go to war--forests, crops, buildings, people... \nIn case you  _  don't care about our little mechanical friends,  _  this: Robot technology is currently  _   at a rate 10 million times faster than the evolution of  _  . \nConsidering the advances in robot technology during the upcoming years, Moravec says that robots must pass through four  _   of development before they rule the planet. \nFirst robot technology must achieve the ability to  _   as generalpurpose tools with software running at one million instructions per second (MIPS). Those robots will have the  _   of reptiles  . Next, this happening into 2020, robots will have acquired brains capable of  _   300 million MIPS, which will give them the intelligence of smart mice. A hundred billion MIPS will be  _  sometime after 2030. By then robots will be provided by their  _   (humankind) with monkeylike brains.  _  , at the dawn of 2040, robots will  _  human intelligence and they will quickly surpass humans and challenge people for supremacy   of the planet.",
