    "article": "Adam West is known as Batman to many people in the United States, who played the role in the Batman television series in the 1960s. Adam West says that after the show was  _  , he had a difficult time being less famous than he once was. But that period lasted just a short time  _  he went on with another job.\n\"It's a(n)   _   of not really examining it. Just going along putting one foot   in front of   the other and not thinking too much about it. And, when work   comes along  , think about the work. It's no   _   thing. It's easy. If you are lost in the past, there is   _   to go but down.\"\nBurt Ward played Batman's young helper Robin in the television series. Like Adam West, Burt Ward  _  often at fan conventions. Many people pay to see their childhood   _  , and are happy to have their picture taken with them.\n\"Actually, the fame is there - it just takes a different   _  . Some may think of our TV show being our   _  time, but when I meet people, they act just as   _  as when I was during Batman days. So, it's not that the people   _  , but that the perception   is different.  Honestly, nothing has changed - I'm the same person as I was before.\"\nHe says he has made a   _   living over the past 45 years.   As long as   he is paid for his work, that is all that matters. Being famous does not pay for food, housing and other costs, but  _  does.\nIf people can   _  that this is just part of the job - all the publicity, all the press, all the compliments, they could   _   keep a cool mind and not let it go to their heads. If they look at it as part of their personality and   _  people to bow to them everywhere they go, that's not going to happen! The early Christian philosopher St. Augustine said, \"The desire for   _   tempts even noble minds, but I would rather have truth than money or fame.\"",
