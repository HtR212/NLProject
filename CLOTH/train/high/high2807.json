Anna's house was high enough to escape the flood, so when the water had disappeared and the other houses were  _  there with no roof and no walls and all covered with  _  , her house was  _  quite all right. Her house was quite small, her husband was dead, and she had four children ,  _  Anna took in one of the families that had lost  _  in the flood and she  _  her home with them until it was  _  for them to rebuild their houses. Anna's friends were  _  when they saw Anna do this. They could not understand why Anna wanted to give  herself  so much more work and trouble when she already had quite a few children to  _  \"Well,\" Anna  explained to  her friends, \"at the end of the First World War, a woman in the town where I  _  lived found herself very poor, because her husband  had been killed  in the war and she had a lot of children,  _  I have now. The day before Christams, this woman said to her children, 'We won't be able to have much for  Christmas  this year, so I'm going to  _  only one present for all of us. Now I'll go and get it.' She came back  _  a girl who was even poorer than they, and who had no parents. 'Here's our present, ' she said to her children. The children were  _  to get such a present. They welcomed the little girl, and she grew up as their sister.  _  was that Christmas present.",
