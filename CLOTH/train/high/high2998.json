But it was hard making a living on the sea. He worked hard and would stay out   _   he caught enough to   _   his family. He was a big man, and he was strong from   _   the nets and fighting the seas for his   _  .\"\n  Frank's voice   _   a bit. \"When the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He would pull right up in front, and it seemed like everybody would be   _   around and watching. Then he would lean over and give me a big kiss on the   _  and tell me to be a good boy. It was so   _  for me,for here I was twelve years old.\" \n  He   _  and then went on, \" I remember the day I thought I was too old for a good-bye kiss. When we got the school, he had his   _   big smile. He started to   _   toward me, but I put my hand up and said, 'No, Dad.' It was the first time I had ever talked to him that way, and he had this   _  look on his face.\"\n  I said, \"Dad, I'm too old for a good-bye kiss.\" My Dad looked at me for the longest time, and his eyes started to   tear up  . I had never seen him cry. He turned and said, \"You're right. You are a big boy...... a man. I won't kiss you anymore.\"\n  For the moment, the tears began to   well up   in his eyes. \"It wasn't long   _   that when my Dad went to sea and never  _  .\"\nI looked at Frank and saw that tears were running   _  his cheeks. Frank spoke again. \" Guys, you don't know what I would have my Dad give me... just one more kiss on the cheek...... to feel his   _   old face...If I had been a man, I would never have told my Dad I was too old for a good-bye kiss.\"",
