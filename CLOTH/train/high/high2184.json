At first I thought I was brave to deal with any  _  in a foreign country.  _  during my first semester here, I always felt so  _  . Being silent was my  _  to interact with Americans. Although I wanted to make  _  , I didn't know how to approach them. I was afraid that they wouldn't understand my English and I  _  to be careful not to make anyone angry. Therefore, I always  waited for  others to talk to me.\nIn fact, I found that a lot of American students are  _  me. They also don't know how to interact with international students, so they choose not to be  _  . Obviously, two passive persons  _  have a chance to communicate with each other. And that's why people from the same country like to  _  themselves from others. They feel more  _  with their own people and they are used to their own ways of behaving.  In the end  , they build barriers   for themselves.\nHowever, I  _  to approach Americans gradually. Since I had the  _  to come to this country, I told myself, there was no reason for me to be  _  of approaching and communicating with Americans. When I showed kindness to them, most of them  _  my kindness. I found Americans are actually fun and  _  . Now I am glad that I've made some good American friends here.
