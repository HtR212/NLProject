    "article": "(2012)It is a very interesting story that I heard.\nA young man longing to   _   the beautiful daughter of a farm owner came one day to the   _   to make the proposal .\nThe farm owner looked at him   up and down  ,saying,\"All right. Let's go to my pasture .I'll   let out   three bulls one by one. If you can catch any one's   _  ,you're qualified to marry my daughter.\"\nThen they ca me together to the pasture. The young man stood waiting   _   for the first bull to appear. A few minutes later the cattle shed  opened and a bull rushed out   _   him. It was the largest and ugliest bull he had ever seen. He thought maybe the   _   one would be better,so he stepped aside to let it   _   the pasture to the back gate of the shed.\nThe shed   _   again and the second bull came rushing out. It was not only very big but also unusually   _  .It stood with its hoofs  kicking and its throat muttering .\"How terrible it is!The next cannot be as   _   as this.\"He was so scared that he hurried to   _   behind the railings( ).It rushed away to the back gate.\nSoon afterwards,the shed opened for the third bull to come out.  Seeing   it,the young man became very happy. It was not only small in   _   but also thin and weak in strength-the   _   type of a bull for him. When it rushed toward him he was ready to   _  .With a jump he stretched his hands to catch its tail but   in vain  -it simply had no tail at all.\nIt goes without saying that the young man   _   to marry the farmer's beautiful daughter. He had been given   _  ,but they had all gone in a flash.",
