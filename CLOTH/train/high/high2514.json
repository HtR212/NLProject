    "article": "One day,while I was walking to work,I decided to bring some flowers that I had picked from my garden that morning.On the way,I  came across  a stranger and presented the bunch to him with a smile card.  _  by the sense of joy I felt from giving flowers to another person,and may be  _  his day,I wanted to do it again. When I got to my office,I had the  _  of anonymously leaving flowers around the workplace.The impersonal  _  of the building where I work makes me  _  .It just feels a little boring sometimes,  _  it's a nice building with great light.I  _  lots of people might feel the same way,so why not put a little  _  there,and throw in an inspirational quote while I'm at it?  After all  ,who doesn't like flowers? So,for the past month,I've been  _  flowers in a little cup on the sink in the bathroom.Each week,I  _  the flowers and the quote.It always feels  _  for me to read quotes like Henry David Thoreau's \"If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams,he will meet with a  _  unexpected in common hours.\" and Gandhi's \"The fragrance always  _  on the hand that gives the rose.\" If anything,I figured,it at least makes me  _  each time I visit the bathroom. Then today,when I walked in,I noticed  _  flowers in the cup,and a quote that someone else had written!It  _  ,\"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\"--Gandhi. This little act  _  me that,at the end of the day,we're all just people with hearts  regardless of  the various roles and different hats we may wear in the workplace. I did a little dance and I am smiling wide for the rest of the day!",
