    "article": "It has been argued by some that gifted children should be grouped in special classes. The  _  is based on the belief that in regular classes these children are held back in their intellectual growth by  _  situations that has designed for the  _  children. There can be little doubt that  _  classes can help the gifted children to graduate earlier and take their place in life sooner. However, to take these  _  out of the regular classes was created serious problems. I observed a number of  _  students who were taken out of a special class and placed in  _  class. In the special class, they showed little ability to use their own judgment, relying  _  on their teachers' directions. In the regular class, having no worry about keeping up, they began to reflect  _  on many problems. Some of which were not on the school program. Many are concerned that gifted children become  _  and lose interest in learning. However, this  _  is more often from parents and teachers than from students, and some of these  _  simply conclude that special classes should be set up for those who are  _  . Some top students do feel bored in class, but why they  _  so goes far beyond the work they have in school. Studies have shown that to be bored is to be anxious. The gifted child who is bored is an  _  child.",
