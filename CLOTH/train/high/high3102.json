Language is a means of  _  , but it is much more than that. Many animals can  _  . The dance of the honeybee communicates the location of flowers  _  other members of the hive . But human language permits communication about anything,  _  things like unicorns that have never existed. The key  _  in the fact that different words can be  _  together in different ways, according to  _  to communicate different meanings. Language is the most important learning we do. Nothing can  _  humans so much as our ability to communicate abstract  _  , whether about the university, the mind, love, dreams, or ordering a drink. It is an extremely complex  _  that we take for granted. Indeed, we are not aware of most  _  of our speech and understanding. Consider what happens when one person is speaking to  _  . The speaker has to translate thoughts into  _  language. Brain imaging studies suggest that the time from thoughts to the  _  of speech is extremely fast. Only 0.04 seconds! The listener must hear the sounds to  figure out  what the speaker means. He must use the sounds of speech to  _  the spoken words, understand the pattern of  _  of the words (sentences), and finally  _  the meaning. This takes somewhat longer, a minimum of about 0.5 seconds. But once started, it is of course a(n)  _  process.",
