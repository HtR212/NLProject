    "article": "During all those summers as a kid when I worked at Indian Jan's Taco Stand, I like working with an old Indian woman named Darlene. She would tell me about our  _  heritage. It is important that my white skin doesn't overpower my native  _  , according to her.\nI  believe in  the importance of my heritage. It's one of the things I've learned from Darlene.  _  I'm a half Native American, you would never guess it by looking at me. On the  _  , I look like my mother--I have her light hair, German eyes, and pale skin. My father is the native one, and I grew up fully aware of the  _  between his skin and mine. People in the small Nebraska town where I grew up often seemed  _  of his dark skin and shiny black hair. He often wore it long and in ponytail , something that men in our  _  just didn't do.\nI grew up feeling like I didn't belong to either of my-parents'  _  and that I couldn't ever be anything in-between. When I was at home in Nebraska, people would  _  say \"Broken Rope? What kind of a name is that?\"  _  , in the summer, when we visited the reservation where my father grew up, I would always be the whitest person around, sticking  _  like snow.\nI  _  Darlene all of these when I was thirteen. She stopped kneading the bread and kept  _  for a minute, just looking at me.  _  she leaned closely to my ear and said, \"We are all one people.\"\nI looked at her,  _  \"It doesn't matter what your skin color is,\" she said. \"It doesn't matter who your parents are, or where you live, or what you  _  . You matter because you  _  .You're the past. You're the future. You  _  both heritages inside you, and you keep them alive forever. That's what's  _  . \"",
