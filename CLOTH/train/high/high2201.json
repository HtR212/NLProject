    "article": "I joined class five at the South Eastern Railway Mixed Higher Secondary School in Kharagpur, West Bengal. As the   _   girl in class, it took a while to make friends, but I found a kindred spirit   right away: my class teacher, Miss Rafique, who also taught English.\nThe first assignment she gave the class was to write a letter to a friend about any recent   _  .\nI'd never written a letter before but I used my   _   and wrote in great detail about my visit to Delhi, a place I had   _   been to. I wrote about all its tourist spots, which included a   _   When Miss Rafique returned our assignments to us, she made a(n) 28 _  in front of our class of 60 girls and boys. \"Annapurna has written the best letter,\" she said.\nI stood   _   by Miss Rafique's desk as she read out my letter to the class   _   handing my notebook to me. Reaching my seat, I opened my notebook and was   _   to see many red marks--all spelling and grammatical   _  . I thought a best letter would be one with no mistakes. There were also two little 33 _  in the margins  . \"Delhi doesn't have a beach,\" and \"Very good !\"\nWhen I looked at a   _   notebook, her letter was error-free.  Later, I realized that my classmates had memorized and reproduced sample letters from High School English Grammar & Composition by Wren and Martin. In spite of the mistakes, it was my originality that Miss Rafique actually 35 _ . Soon, my teacher made me realize that math and science weren't my only   _   subjects; I could do well in English too.\nThanks to her timely   _  , I now write articles on nutrition for magazines and I enjoy my job.",
