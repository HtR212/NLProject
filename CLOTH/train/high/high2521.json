When I felt sad about having to  _  on Christmas Day, a woman and four small children showed up at my desk. \"Are you all sick?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" the woman said  _  and lowered her head. But when it came to telling me about their  _  , things got a little surprising. They all seemed to be well and there was nothing  _  with their body. Why did they tell a  _  that they were all sick? I did not say anything but  _  that it might be a little time before a doctor could  _  them . The mother said, \"Take your time. We can  _  here. It's so warm.\" When she finished the register chart, I noticed she didn't write down their address----were they  _  ? I looked at the  _  around the Christmas tree. The children were excited and  _  to be healthy. The littlest one was pointing at the Christmas tree and said something to the mother. Then I was sure that they came here not because of  _  but only for warmth. I went back to the nurses' station and  _  the homeless family. The nurses,  _  about working on Christmas Day like me, turned to feel sorry for the family and decided to  _  .We bought delicious food in the hospital restaurant and  _  a big dinner for our guests. We needed  _  . So we put apples in a basket and collected candies and clothes. Just as we were seriously prepared to meet the physical needs of the  _  , our team worked to meet the needs of a family who just wanted to be  _  on Christmas Day. Later, as the family was to  _  , the youngest child ran to me and said, \"Thank you very much. Good bye. \"",
