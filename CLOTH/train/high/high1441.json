    "article": "When I worked in a large city, passing by someone experiencing homelessness wasn't an uncommon sight. The difficult situation of those I saw touched me  _  , and I often felt, \"I would be one of them  but for  the kindness of God.\" I felt forced to do something, and as a single mom and newcomer to my field, I decided to  come up with  a plan that fit my limited budget. I began by  setting aside  five to ten dollar bills each payday, and during the week, passing  _  out to those I met on the street. Though a dollar felt like a small  _  , I realized how  _  it was to give the gift of being seen: for me to recognize that those I passed by were people just like me.  _  we would joke a bit and smile together. On some occasions, I was able to  _  more. I'll never know how and if the dollars  _  , but I know that the connections we made did. One day after I had started this weekly practice, I had  saved up  enough to buy myself a new winter coat. With my recent purchase wrapped around my shoulders, I  _  that my old coat could still be put to use by someone who had little or nothing to  _  them from the cold. However, at that moment, I felt inspired to pass on this opportunity for  _  . I turned to the salesman who had helped me, and asked if he would feel  _  taking my old coat, walking to the corner, and offering it to someone  in need  . Slightly taken aback, he smiled. \"I will as soon as I get a break,\" he said. \"Thanks for your  _  .\" I can't help but feel that my  _  with kindness have moved me to pass it on, and in this way, I feel I've helped more than just those I  _  by on the street. Kindness touches many hearts, and I am grateful for the way it has  _  mine.",
