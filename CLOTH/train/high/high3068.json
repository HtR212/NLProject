    "article": "When I was in high school, I didn't know anything about engineering. At that time, when the car I drove needed repairing, I was afraid to take it to the  _  . Because honestly, the mechanic could have  _  me an electric can opener and said, \"This is part of your car and it's  _  -----pay me to fix it.\" Then I wouldn't have known any better.\nAt the end of my junior year of high school, I heard about a summer program  _  to interest girls in engineering. The six-week program was free, and students were  _  college credits and a dorm room at the University of Maryland. I applied to the program, not because I wanted to be an engineer, but because I was looking forward to  _  and wanted to stay away from my parents for six weeks.\nI was accepted to the program and I earned six engineering credits. The next year I entered the university as an engineering student. Five years later I had a degree and three good job offers.\nI can't help shaking  _  I hear about studies that show women are  at a disadvantage  when it comes to math. They imply that I am a little stupid. I'm not, but I  _  know that if I hadn't met with that summer program, I wouldn't be an engineer.\nWhen I was growing up, I was told, as many students were, to do what I was best at. But I didn't know what that was. Most people think that when you are  good at  something, it comes easily to you. But this is what I discovered: just because a subject is  _  to learn, it does not mean you are not good at it. You just have to grit your teeth and work hard to get good at it. Once you do, there's good  _  that you will enjoy it more than anything else.",
