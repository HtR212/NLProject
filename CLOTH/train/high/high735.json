Last night, a small group of us   _  a\nvisit to Taipei's most famous and biggest night market, the Shilin Night\nMarket.\nI hadn't been here   _  1988,\nand it hasn't changed a bit: still  _  with\npeople. If one doesn't like noise but wants a  _  of\nthe night market experience, he is advised to try a smaller,  _  famous one, or avoid weekends.\nNight markets are a great place to   find out  the latest popular foods.  Right now  , believe it or\nnot, Indian kati rolls are very popular. Alibaba's Kitchen is an  _  popular place that makes kati rolls the old-fashioned way. The people\nhere are all Chinese, however, which may  explain  their\npoor \"Indian\" English.\nI'm not   _  eating\nChinese meat food, so I tried the vegetable one.  On the whole  the\nkati roll was a disappointment,  _  the paratha,\nanother kind of Indian food, was excellent. It was too dry and basically only a\npotato sandwich. It could have used a greater variety of   _  .\nA friend told me that the   _  kati rolls in town are in the Xindian Night Market. I believe him,\nbecause the man  _  them is an actual South\nAsian,  _  has lived in Taiwan for years. I\nwalked  _  his stand when I was there last time, but was   _  busy to give it a try. I'm just looking for a  _  to go back.",
