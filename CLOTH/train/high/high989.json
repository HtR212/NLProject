    "article": "Sunshine on a Rainy Day\n              Have you ever had a day when everything seemed to go wrong, and nothing seemed to go right? Not too long ago I was having one of those   _  . I was discouraged, tired, and sad. My focus was on me, me, me, after all, no one else was experiencing the same sufferings   _  I was.\n              I   _   my sad state to my mother, hoping for some pity.   Instead  , she said , \"I heard Jamie was having a(n)   _   day, too. Why don't you make her some cookies and we'll   _   them to her this afternoon?\" I didn't really want to,   _  decided that I didn't want to go back to my other problems just yet. I   _   the cookies and arranged them on a little plate. Then I made a card with a sunflower on it and wrote a small note of   _   words.\n              That afternoon we   dropped by   my friend's house. I went to the door and   _   the bell. Soon, Jamie came to the door and looked at me   in surprise   for the unexpected visit. Before she could say anything I rushed, \"I   _   you were having a hard day and decided to bring you   _   .I hope your day goes better.\" The look that came over Jamie' face was   _   that I could never put into words. It was 51 as if  a darkened sky was suddenly lit with the golden rays of the sun; it was as if in that small act, her day was   _  .\n              I got back into the car and for some   _   reason, I felt a lot better myself. That day I experienced the   _   Jamie Barrie attempted to describe.\"Those who bring sunshine to the lives of others,   cannot   keep it off from themselves.\"",
