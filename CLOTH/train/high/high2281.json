    "article": "Once there were three travelers checking in a hotel. When they went out in the morning, one traveler brought an umbrella and another one took a crutch  _  the third one left with  _  whatsoever. When they were back in the evening, the man who brought an umbrella got his clothes  _  in rain; the one taking a crutch fell, all covered with mud; but the man empty-handed kept his clothes dry,  _  any mud on it. The former two guys felt it was  _  so they asked the third man why. The third guy didn't reply, but  _  asked the man with an umbrella, \"Then why were you caught in the rain  _  without falling?\" \"When it was raining, I felt so  _  for my prediction that I opened the umbrella and walked in the rain  _  I didn't think I would be caught in the rain, but  _  my clothes got so showered. Going to the places which were too muddy to cross,  considering  that I didn't have a crutch for fear of falling, I walked very carefully. It  turned out  that I walked all the way back  _  and sound.\" After hearing  _  the first man said, the third man then asked the man with a crutch why he became muddied all over himself instead of getting showered. He answered like this, \"When it was raining, I had no umbrella, so I  _  chose those places I could  _  from the rain to walk through. In the muddy places, I went on with my crutch, but I hadn't thought I fell.\" The empty-handed traveler  _  , \"When it was raining, I chose the places protecting myself from the rain and in the muddy places I kept particularly  _  , so I was neither drenched nor fell.\" The advantages are  _  . Only if we create advantages by virtue of the objective environment can we  _  a success.",
