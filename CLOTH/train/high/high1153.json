    "article": "You Did More Than Carry My Books\nMark was waking home from school one day when he noticed the boy ahead of him had dropped all of the books he was carrying, along with a baseball bat and several other things. Mark  _  down and helped the boy pick up these articles.   _   they were going the same way, he helped to carry some of them for him. As they walked Mark   _   the boy's name was Bill, that he   _  computer games, baseball and history, that he was having a lot of   _  with his other subjects and that he had just broken  _  with his girlfriend.\nThey arrived at Bill's home first and Mark was  _  in for a Coke and to watch some television. The afternoon passed    _  with a few laughs and some shared small talk, and then Mark went home. They   _  to see each other around school, had lunch together once or twice, and then both ended up from the same high school. Just three weeks before  _  , Bill asked Mark if they  _  talk.\nBill   _  him of the day years ago when they had first met. \"Do you  _  wonder why I was carrying so many things home that day ?\" asked Bill. \"You see, I   _  out my locker because I didn't want to leave a mess   _  anyone else. I had panned to run away and I was going home to  _  my things. But after we spent some time together   _  and laughing, I realized that   _  I had done that, I would have  _  a new friend and missed all the fun we would have together.\nSo you see, Mark, when you picked up my books that day you did a lot more. You   _  my life.\"",
