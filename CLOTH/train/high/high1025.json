    "article": "My best friend is Cocoa, and I live in a senior-citizen apartment. Cocoa is a ten-year-old dog and I am a sixty-nine-year-old lady, so you can see we both qualify as  _  citizens. He is a  _  companion. He does many amusing things that make me  _  , and when that happens, he is so delighted  _  he just keeps it up. But one afternoon, Cocoa started acting strangely. I was sitting on the floor playing with him,  _  he started pawing and smelling at the right side of my  _  . He had never done anything like this ever before, and I told him, \"No.\" To Cocoa, one \"no\" is usually  _  , but not that day. He stopped briefly, and then  _  ran toward me, throwing his entire weight at the right side of my chest. He crashed into me and I cried in  _  , falling down to the floor. Soon after this, I felt a lump . I went to my doctors, and after X-rays  _  and lab work were done, they told me I had cancer. When cancer starts, a  _  of calcium builds. Then the lump or cancer attaches itself to this wall. When Cocoa jumped on me, the force of the impact broke the lump away from the wall. This made it possible for me to  _  the lump. I had a complete mastectomy and the cancer has not  _  to any other part of my body. The doctors told me if the cancer had gone undetected even six more months, it would have been too  _  . Was Cocoa  _  of just what he was doing? I'll never really know. What I do know is that Cocoa not only shares his life with me, he has also made sure that I will be around to share my life with him!",
