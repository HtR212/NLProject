Now, if there's one thing I can tell you about any sports, it is that wrestling is probably the sport that has the least   _  . There are only two people out on the mat, so you cannot   _   it on your teammates or your coach. And guess what? There is no   _   because we do the whole thing indoors, so you can't say, \"It was raining.\" or \"It was snowing.\" It makes   _   to say wrestling is the sport with the least luck.\nOn our team were two world champions: one of them had been world champion five times. We   _   had five people who were national champions. One of them was a guy   _   the name of John.\nJohn had never been 27 _  in my high school wrestling competition that I could remember,   _   he was a national champion. There was nobody locally who could touch him.\nOne day, we 29 went for  a match with our biggest opponent  . John went out on the mat, and about a minute and 30 seconds into the match he tried to make a particular   _  . He rolled over, and his opponent   _   him halfway through his roll. He was pinned   _  !\nThe match was over.\nI remember on the bus on the way home, one of our teammates tried to   _   John by saying, \"Oh, he just got lucky.\" And John said, \"That's so stupid. The opportunity presented itself,   _   he exploited it.\"\nWe used to have this big sign in our wrestling room that the coach had   _   there. \"Luck is what happens when opportunity   _   preparation.\"\nJohn's opponent was prepared to exploit this opportunity. The probability of   _   John was not strong, and he knew it. But he paid attention to the   _   opportunity to present itself, and he defeated and pinned a fivetime national champion.\nIn other words, the real   _   is Be Prepared. It's not just finding the opportunity; you have to be prepared to   _  it.",
