Look back with   _   and think how often you've judged roughly, said unkind things, and pushed yourself ahead at the   _   of a friend. Then count the occasions when you indicated clearly and truly that you were   _  . A bit frightening, isn't it? It is frightening because some deep wisdom   _   us knows that when even a small wrong has been committed, some mysterious moral feeling is disturbed; and it stays out of   _   until fault is acknowledged and   _   expressed.\nI remember a doctor friend, Clarence Lieb, telling me about a man who came to him with a variety of   _  : headaches, insomnia and stomach trouble. No physical cause could be   _  . Finally Dr. Lieb said to the man, \"  _   you tell me what's worrying you, I can't help you.\"\nAfter some   _  , the man confessed that, as executor   of his father's will, he had been   _   his brother, who lived abroad, of his inheritance  . Then and there the   _   old doctor made the man   _   to his brother asking for forgiveness and enclosing a cheque as the first step in restoring their good   _  . He then went with him to the mailbox in the corridor  .

If you can think of someone who   _   an apology from you, someone you have wronged, or judged too roughly, or just neglected, do something about   _   right now.",
