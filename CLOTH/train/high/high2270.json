    "article": "This was our time,our senior year. My best friend Beth and I had big dreams...But in my world of \"big dreams\" this one small  _  freshman did not appear on my radar . My best friend Beth was the first to  _  her. \"Kristi,did you see the girl standing by us in the lunch line --- she looks so  _  ,so out of place.\" We had heard of a family that had just  _  to our town from the country of Cambodia. We knew there was supposed to be a  _  girl at our school from that family,but we had yet to meet her until now. Leourn was a small dark-haired beauty. She  _  with the little English she knew and that made it very  _  for her to get to know people in our small town.Every day Leourn kept her eyes fixed on the  _  and we never,ever saw her  look up  . What could we do to help Leourn?With  _  and faith,we decided to let her know that there were people who  _  . We sought out Leourn in the halls and said \" Hi \" and tried to continue to engage her in  _  . Leourn responded to us with smiles and small talk. When Valentine's Day came,I  _  thought of Leourn and decided I would send her a  _  for the holiday. Thinking that she was  _  learning our language and customs,I simply wrote, \"Happy Valentine's Day,Leourn. Your friend Kristi.\" I will  _  forget that Valentine's Day. For the  _  time,Leourn was the one who  _  me out. She found me in the hall with the carnation in her hands. Then she did something  _  .She actually took her eyes off the floor,looked up at me with beautiful eyes and in a  _  whisper said two words: \"Thank You.\" It was a life-changing moment for me.",
