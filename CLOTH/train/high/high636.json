Everybody knows this, and nobody would think of questioning  this fact.   _   there are many people who do not seem to know   _   memory works in the same way .   _  someone says that he has a good memory , he really means that he   keeps   his memory in practice   it frequently 32 _  consciously( ) or unconsciously . When someone   _  says that his memory is poor, he really means that he does not give it enough   _   to become strong.\nIf a friend complains  that his arms and legs are   _  we know that it is his own fault . But if he tells that he has a poor memory,   _  of us think his parents are to blame    _  that he is just unlucky, and few of us   think   that it is just as much his own fault as if it is his arms or    _   weak .\nHave you ever noticed  that people who cannot read or write usually have   _  memories than those who can read or write? This is because those who cannot read or write   have to   remember things, they have to remember dates, places, names, songs and stories.   So   their   _   is the whole time being used. \nSo   _  you want a good memory, learn from those people, and   _  remembering.",
