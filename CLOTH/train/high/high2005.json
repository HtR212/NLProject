    "article": "Countless people appear in your life---familiar or strange, close or distant. Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there to serve some sort of  _  , to teach you a lesson, or to help you  figure out  who you are or who you want to become. You never think about who these people may be (possibly your roommate, neighbor, co-worker, long lost friend, lover, or even a complete stranger), but when you lock eyes with them, you know at that very moment they will  _  your life in some way.\nAnd sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful and unfair at first, but with more  _  you find that without overcoming those difficulties you would have  _  realized your potential, strength, willpower, or heart.\nEverything happens for a reason. Nothing happens  by accident  or by means of good luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness and complete stupidity all occur to  _  the limits of your soul.  _  these small tests whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved , straight, flat road to  _  . It would be safe and comfortable, but dull and  _  . The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you experience, help to create who you are and who you become.\nEven the  _  experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant  and important ones. If someone hurts you,  _  you, or breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious when you open your heart. If someone loves you, love them back  _  , not only because they love you, but because  in a way  , they are teaching you to love and how to open your  _  and eyes to things.\nMake every day count.  _  every moment and take from those moments everything that you possibly can for you may never be able to experience it again. Talk to people that you have never talked to  _  , and actually listen. Let yourself fall in love, break free, and set your sights high. Hold your head up because you have  _  right to. Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don't believe in yourself, it will be hard for others to believe in you. You can make your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it with absolutely no  _  .\nMost importantly, if you LOVE someone, tell him or her, for you never know what tomorrow may have in  _  . And learn a lesson in life each day that you live.\nThat's the story of life.",
