The destruction  was caused when a very big  _  sent tsunamis smashing into Indian Ocean coastlines.\nCommunities in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Malaysia and East Africa have been  _  by the huge waves. Whole towns were simply swept aside by the power of the water. Cars, trains and buildings could not  _  , let alone the people who stood  in the way  .\nThe earthquake  _  9.0 on the Richter scale  and occurred  _  the coast of Indonesia. It was  _  as the fifth strongest since 1900. Scientists said the quake was as  _  as a million of the atomic bombs that were  _  onto Japan during World War II. It may be the worst natural disaster in recent history  _  it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas.\nBecause such waves  _  happen in the Indian Ocean, there is no system in place to  _  coastal communities they are about to be hit.\nTsunami is Japanese for \"harbor wave\". They are usually caused by a sudden  _  or fall of part of the Earth's crust  under the ocean. Tsunamis often happen in oceans and they are most  _  in the Pacific.\nTsunamis can be very long--as much as 100 kilometers--and be as far as one hour apart. They are able to  _  entire oceans without losing much energy. One of the most striking  _  about tsunamis is that an earthquake on one side of the Pacific Ocean can cause giant waves and destruction on the other side. When the ocean is deep, tsunamis can travel unnoticed  _  speeds of up to 800 kilometers per hour.\nThe wave may only be a few meters high in the ocean.  _  when it is near the shore and reaches shallow   water, the wave  builds up  very quickly in height. Witnesses  in some areas of Indonesia reported seeing up to 10-metre high waves crash into the shore.\nTsunamis travel  _  in all directions from the center of an earthquake and attack coastlines. They can easily suck people out to sea, cause flooding and destroy property.",
