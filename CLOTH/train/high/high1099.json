Louisville, Kentucky was a place where basketball was an important part of life, and  _  taking my son to an NBA exhibition game was one of those special moments. But little did I realize how special that evening was going to be! It was blowing some mean wind. Josh  _  my hand as we crossed the parking lot and  _  for the famous Freedom Hall.  _  eight years old, he still felt it was okay to hold his father's hand, and I felt grateful, knowing that this kind of moments would pass  _  . The stadium  _  nineteen-thousand-plus fans, and it definitely looked like a sellout .The expectation of seeing Mrhael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls  _  the Washington Bullets  sped up  our pace across the parking lot, thinking about  _  the game was going to go. The tumstile clicked and Josh hung on to his souvenir ticket stub like he had just won the lottery! We pushed our  _  to the upper-level seats of the \"true\" fans. Before we know it, the game was  _  way. During a time out, we dashed to  _  hot dog and Coke and rushed back so that we  wouldn't  miss a single part of the game. Things were going as expected until halftime. I started to talk to some friends  _  when there was a pull on my sleeve, my arm was pulled over by a  _  young Josh, and he began putting a multicolored, woven yarn bracelet around my wrist. It  _  really well, and he was really focused attentively as he carefully made a double square knot to keep it secure. On this special  _  I realized the significance of the moment. With a smile, I told him proudly how I knew this was a \"friendship brardet\" and said, \"I guess this means we are  _  \" Without missing a beat, his big brown eyes looking me straight in the face, he exclaimed, \"We're  more than  friends. You're my dad!\"",
