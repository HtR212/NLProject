    "article": "It was Christmas 1961. I was teaching in a small town where my twenty-seven third graders eagerly  _  the great day of gift-giving in advance. Each day the children produced some new  _  -- strings of popcorn, handmade trinkets, and German bell. Through it all she remained alone,  _  from a distance, seemingly miles away. I wondered what  _  happen to this quiet child, once so happy, now suddenly so withdrawn. I hoped the festivities would  appeal to  her. But nothing did. The students made the fried marbles and competed with one anther to bring the  _  ones. The day of gift-giving finally came. We cheered over our handiwork as the presents were  _  . All along, she sat quietly watching. To see her smile, I had made a special bag for her. She opened it so slowly and carefully. I waited but she  turned away  . I had not passed through the wall of isolation she had  _  around herself. After school I sat down in a chair, hardly  _  of what was happening, when she came to me with outstretched hands, bearing a small white box, and slightly soiled,  as though  it had been held many times by  _  , childish hands. She said nothing. \"For me?\" I asked. She said not a word, but  _  her head. I took the box and cautiously opened it. There inside, glistening green, a fried marble  _  from a golden chain. Then I looked into that eight-year-old  _  and saw the question in her dark brown eyes. In a flash I knew -- she had  _  it for her mother, who had died just three weeks before and would never hold her or brush her hair or  _  her childish joys or sorrows. I meant it when I whispered, \"Oh, Maria, it is so beautiful. Your mother would  _  it.\" Neither of us could stop the  _  . She threw herself into my arms and we wept together. And for that brief moment I became her mother, for she had given me the greatest  _  of all: her trust and love.",
