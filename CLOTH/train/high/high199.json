    "article": "Graduation day is a major accomplishment for anyone in high school. After  _  your whole life in classrooms, though, what will be next? For some people, graduation is the  _  time they ever want to see a  _  again. For others, it is the next step in their education. And the few that are not  _  either way yet will most likely either go on to college or go into the military. There are always a few people in every  _  class that don't know what to do,  _  if you make a good choice, you will not be one of them. Some of those people that decide that they never want to  _  a classroom again will most likely  take up  some sort of simple jobs. Others will either find a way aside from school to better themselves,  _  through travel or giving back to the community. High school graduates that already have their futures  _  0ut are pretty rare. They are the  _  who have been preparing for college from the first day that they  _  high school. They most likely applied early to the schools that they were interested  _  and have already dedicated themselves to the career  _  they want. Most of them will become doctors, lawyers, and business people, etc. The last group of people is the biggest. It is the students who  _  know that they want to do something but have no idea what. Some of them will  _  the military and proudly serve our country. Others will go on t0  _  , take basic courses, and then decide what they want to major in. There will be some students even  going on  to a technical school to learn a specific  _  that they can contribute to the workforce.  _  is a stepping stone that can lead you on to better things if you will let it.",
