    "article": "One of the warmest Christmas memories that I have was the year that I was Santa Claus.I was a young substitute for a  _  with a new family just starting out in life.I was  called in  to work at the local grade school on the last day  _  the Christmas holidays. I can still  _  going from classroom to classroom and doing my best to  _  both old and joyful at the same time.I was about 50 pounds heavier then,  _  I had the round little belly part down fine.My beard,however,was another  _  as it kept sliding halfway down my face.I thought that more than a few of the kids  _  me,but it didn't matter.They still enjoyed  _  Santa.They still laughed and delighted in their  _  gifts and candy canes.They still felt joyous and happy.They still knew that they were  _  and that was all that mattered to them. If there is one  _  that I could give to each of you at Christmas time and  _  day of the year,it would be that knowledge that you are loved.You are loved and  watched over  by a greater love than you could ever imagine.You are loved by God who  _  you.In all the difficulties,problems,and heartaches this world  _  ,you are loved.In all the obstacles you must overcome,challenges you must  _  ,and pains you must go through,you are loved.In all the mistakes you make,times you stumble ,and  _  paths you take,you are loved.You are loved every second in your life with a glorious love that will  _  end. Know that you are loved.Know that God loves you always.Rejoice in this love with the  _  heart of a child.And then,like a jolly laughing Santa,go out and share it with the world.",
