    "article": "One family, which had emigrated from Japan and settled at the turn of the century near San Francisco, had established a business in which they grew roses and trucked them into San Francisco three mornings a week. The other family was a naturalized family from Switzerland who also marketed roses, and  _  families became modestly successful,  _  their roses were known in the markets of San Francisco for their  _  vase-life. For four decades the two families were neighbors, and the sons  took over  the farms, but then on December 7, 1941, Japan  _  Pearl Harbor. Although the rest of the family members were American, the  _  of the Japanese family had never been naturalized. In the turmoil and the questions about internment camps , his neighbor made it clear that, if  _  , he would look after his friend's nursery . It was  _  each family had learned in church--Love the neighbor as thyself. \"You would do  the same  for us, \" he told his Japanese friend. It was not long before the Japanese  _  was transported to a poor landscape in Granada, Colorado. The relocation center consisted of tar-paper-roofed barracks  _  by barbed wire and armed guards. A full year went by. Then two. Then three. While the  _  neighbors were in internment, their friends worked in the greenhouses, the  _  before school and on Saturdays, and the father's work often stretched to 16 and 17 hours. And then  one day  , when the war in Europe had  _  , the Japanese family packed up and  _  a train. They were going home. What would they find? The family was  _  at the train station by their neighbors, and when they got to their home, the whole Japanese family stared.. There was the nursery, complete, clean and shining in the sunlight, neat, prosperous and healthy. So was the balance of the bank passbook  _  to the Japanese father. And the house was  _  as clean and welcoming as the nursery. And there on the dining room  _  was one perfect red rosebud, just waiting to unfold- the gift of one neighbor to another.",
