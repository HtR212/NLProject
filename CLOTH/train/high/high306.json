I only  _  to her as \"My Aunt Fannie\" because it always made my father chuckle and my mother look  _  at both of us--at me for being  _  of my elder and at my father for  _  my bad behavior. I  _  both reactions so I grasped every opportunity to work the name into as many conversations as possible.

Money can make you feel rich for a while, but it is the relationships and the memories of time spent with friends and family that truly leave you wealthy. And that is a  _  that anyone can build.",
