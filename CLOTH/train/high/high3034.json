    "article": "Not long ago I wasn't doing very well in exams and I was full of disappointment and  _  thinking. While on the Internet, I met many new friends, but one in particular  stands out  . His nickname is Colorful Day, and we  _  on the web. He told me he lost his  _  at age 15 and felt the whole world had closed its door to him.\nHe was  _  so fast that I couldn't believe he was blind! But he continued to  _  ,\" Five years ago, I realized it was time to change my life. I had read about Helen Keller and understood her life  _  . So I developed a website about her life  as well as  mine called \"Three Days to See\".\nI visited his website which was well produced and vividly  _  .\nI asked, \"How did you  _  to build such a website?\" He said, \"Thanks to the new technology, I can use software specially  _  for the blind.  _  I point the cursor  , it will just read it out to me. We can do far more things and  _  more information than we could before. \"\nI then asked, \"Didn't you have great difficulty with it?\" He hesitated and then began his  _  with a smiling face, \"Yes, but I have faith in myself to  _  my colorful days. And modern technology gives me this medium and  _  to do it. \"\nHis  _  attitude towards life made me believe that our destiny offers not the cup of despair,  _  the chalice   of opportunity. I returned to my lessons, with a smile on my face and with  _  of a colorful future.\nThe Internet, which opened to me to  _  different lives and cultures, has a charm you can't find in another wise non-virtual world.",
