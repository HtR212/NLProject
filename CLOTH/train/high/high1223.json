    "article": "That morning, I stepped into the classroom, ready to share my knowledge and experience with seventy-five students who would be my English Literature class. Having taught in  _  for seventeen years, I had no  _  about my ability to hold their attention and toimpress on them my  _  for the literature of my mother tongue. As I entered the room, I was  _  when the monitor shouted: \"Stand up!\" The entire class rose, and I was somewhat  _  about how to get them to sit down again. Once that awkwardness was over, I quickly  _  my calmness and began what I thought was an informed lecture, sure to gain their respect -- perhaps  _  their admiration. I went back to my office with the rosy glow which came from a sense of achievement. I asked my students to keep  _  as homework. However, as I read them, the rosy glow was gradually  _  by a strong sense of sadness. The first diary said, \"Our literature teacher didn't teach us anything today.  _  her next lecture will be better.\" Greatly surprised, I read diary after diary, each expressing a  _  theme. \"Didn't I teach them anything? I described the entire philosophical framework of Western thought and laid the historical  _  for all the works we'll study in class,\" I complained. \"How  _  they say I didn't teach them anything?\" It was a long term, and it  _  became clear that my ideas about  _  were not the same as those of my students. I thought a teacher's job was to raise  _  questions and provide enough background so that students could  _  their own conclusions. My students thought a teacher's job was to provide  _  information as directly and clearly as possible. What a difference!  _  , I benefited a lot, for my experience with my Chinese students has made me a  _  American teacher, knowing how to teach in a different culture.",
