    "article": "In my early childhood, my parents and teachers taught me to be persistent in every task I devoted myself to. I was  _  that persistence is the only way towards success. But a small  _  made me change my mind. One day my twoyearold son,  _  at a dozen of \"stood\" color markerpens, cheered excitedly,\"Mummy, look! I did it.\" Afterwards, he collected some ballpens,  _  to do the same. Hard though he tried, the ballpens just lay  _  . He turned to me for help. Noticing they had either sharp or round ends, I said  _  , \"Mummy can't help you.\" To my surprise, he wouldn't listen and continued trying... I was dumbfounded by his persistence. My son's behaviour reminded me of George who was always  _  in his work and rarely talked to anyone. To him,  _  , there was no such thing called weekends or holidays. Our boss praised  _  about him and  _  us to look up to him as a role model. One day I met George. \"Gonna work late again tonight?\" \"Probably can't leave till midnight,\" he said. \"How many hours have you put in here each week, eighty or ninety?\" \"  At least  .\" \"Don't you have time to be with your family at all?\" He shook his head slowly and  let out  a sigh. \"It's not what I wanted. But I have worked on it for so long. It's much too  _  to even think about letting go.\" A year later I resigned. The  _  thing I heard about him was that his wife divorced him. Since then I've never seen him. But occasionally his aged  _  would come to my mind. Until that day,  _  knowing why the ballpens couldn't stand up, the twoyearold had  _  the impossibility after many failures. He put aside all the ballpens and kept only those water markers for his \"game\".  _  , he already learned to let go of his previous  _  attempts. In our daily life, many headaches can be avoided if we know how to  _  them and then decisively let go of them immediately.",
