    "article": "When passing through an airport one morning, I caught one of those trains that take travelers from the main terminal  to their   _   gates. Free and clean, the trains run   back and forth   all day long. Not many people consider them   _  , but this Saturday I heard laughter.\nAt the front of the first car, a man and his son were looking out of the window at the   _  . The train had just stopped and the passengers  went off  . As the doors closed again, the father said excitedly, \"Here we go! Hold on to me   _  ! Look!\" the father said to his son. \"See that pilot? I   _  he's walking to his plane.\" The son craned his neck to look.\nAs I got off, I saw that man and his son were back at the platform, too.\n\"Do you want to go home now?\" the father asked.\n\"I want to   _  some more!\"\n\"More?\" the father said. \"You're not tried?\"\n\"This is fun!\" his son said.\n\"All right,\" the father replied, and when a door opened, we all got on.\nI then realized that they had not been   heading for   a flight at all, but had just been riding the shuttle for fun.\n\"Where are all these people going, Daddy?\" the son asked.\n\"All over the world,\" the father replied. The other people in the airport were leaving for places or arriving at the ends of their journeys. The father and the son,   _  , were just riding this shuttle together,   making   it exciting. The father and his son shared each other's   _  .\nThere are parents who can   _   to send their children to Europe or Disneyland, yet many of those children turn out rotten and cause social problems. There are parents who live in   _   and cannot give their children cars or   swimming pools  , but their kids grow up to be happy and successful. There are a number of   _   over possible solutions. Yet, the   key to   these problems is simple: if parents care enough to   _   time with and pay attention to their kids, these problems will not happen. Here was a father who just cared about spending the day with his son and   came up with  this plan for a Saturday morning. It costs nothing, yet it is the most   _   thing in the world.",
