    "article": "Deo sat staring straight ahead, so as to think about this. Then they were  _  a bridge so high he felt  as if  he were in the airplanes again, and Muhammad said, \"Manhattan,\" and  _  at a horizon of buildings impossibly tall,  _  giant trees, like a sky of pillared   clouds at sunrise in the mountains.  _  a time Deo began to notice vacant lots, and buildings with wood  _  their windows. When Muhammad  _  turned off a main avenue onto a side street, Deo wanted to ask, urgently,  _  they were stopping here. A few yards away, a man stood urinating    _  the wall of a building. The sidewalk was covered with empty cans and  _  and all sorts of paper trash. Muhammad led the way  _  a brick building with broken windows and letters scribbled  here and there on the walls. High up on one wall there were three letters  _  , as if each letter were swollen: P E N. He followed Muhammad  _  , the air reeking of urine and excrement  , up a staircase with a busted railing  ,  _  finally into a room with a dirty wooden floor, a room with  _  door and no furniture. At the end of a  _  hallway, there was a toilet, completely stopped up.\nMuhammad said he stayed here to  _  money. He didn't have to pay rent for this room. His whole reason for being in New York was to  _  and save as much as he could. He would be  _  for Senegal in a few weeks. Deo should do as he had--work here for a while and save, then start a new life. But he should do this  _  back in Africa, not in New York. \"Because it's so hard here,\" Muhammad said.",
