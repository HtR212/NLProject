    "article": "Perhaps the most interesting person I have ever met is an Italian professor of philosophy who teaches at the University of Pisa.  Although  I last met this man eight years ago, I have not forgotten his  _  qualities. First of all, I respected his  _  to teaching. Because his lectures were always well-prepared and clearly delivered, students crowded into his classroom. His followers liked the fact that he  believed in  what he taught.Furthermore, he could be counted on to explain his ideas in an  _  way, introducing such aids to  _  as oil paintings, music, and guest lecturers. Once he  _  sang a song in class in order to make a point clear.  _  , I admired the fact that he would talk to students outside the classroom or talk with them  _  the telephone. Drinking coffee in the cafe, he would easily make friends with students. Sometimes he would  _  a student to a game of chess  Other times  he would join student groups to discuss a variety of  _  : agriculture, diving and mathematics. Many young people visited him in his office for  _  on their studies; others came to his home for social evenings. Finally, I was  _  by his lively sense of humor. He believed that no lesson is a success  _  , during it, the students and the professor  _  at least one loud  _  . Through his sense of humor, he made learning more  _  and more lasting, If it is  _  that life makes a wise man smile and a foolish man cry,  _  my friend is indeed a wise man.",
