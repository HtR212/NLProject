I have ever heard of a story told by  _  who have a lot of experiences. \nThe is a story about a monastery in Europe perched high on    _  several  hundred feet in th air.The only way to reach   _    thewas to be suspended in a basket which was   _  to the top by several monks who pulled and tugged with all their  _   .\nObviously the ride up the steep cliff in that basket was   _  .\nOne tourist got exceedingly nervous about    half-way  up as he noticed that the rope by which hewas    _  was old and frayed.With   _  voice,he asked the monk who was riding with him in the basket how often they changed the   _  .  \nThe monk thought for a moment and answered   _  ,\" Whenever it breaks.\"\nAfter hearing the story, I suddenly felt the   _   of confident. What is Confidence?   As  Li Bai said: \"I am born to be useful\". Let us go with full confidence, to   face up  to the challenges of life, to   _   harvestless fruits!\nFrom now on,   make use of   every minute, every  _  , to enrich the   _  strength, to experience the meaning of life.
