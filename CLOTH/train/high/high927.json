    "article": "It has often been said that a person's life is the sum total of their experiences. That seems like a simple  _  ,but if one accepts this, then why do so many of us engage in practices and activities which are negative and actually  _  us?\n  _  the family of four who decided to each clean a different area. They each took a sponge , did the  _  , and then placed them back in the kitchen.\nA visitor came along who was  _  about what was cleaned in the home, but couldn't tell by  _  since the sponges all looked the same. So, in order to  _  his curiosity, he decided to squeeze each sponge to see what came out.\nWhen the first sponge was squeezed, some cola came out, so the visitor  _  someone cleaned the kitchen with that one. Upon squeezing the second, he found motor oil, so  _  , someone was cleaning the garage. In the third, baby powder came out when it was squeezed, which  _  that the baby's nursery was done. And  _  ,in the last one was wax, which was  _  on the floor.\nAs the visitor laid the last sponge down, he again remarked on their similarity. They all looked the same  _  they were squeezed.\nThe  _  here is that as individuals we are not different from a sponge. We can only squeeze out what is  put in  .As babies, we are born into this world  _  . We are like a new sponge. As we go through  _  , our\"sponge\"is filled with things we  _  through experiences.\nIf we look for the good in others and  _  to adopt a positive attitude around, then as life squeezes us we will have a better chance of coping. If we are constantly finding  _  with others and look for excuses for our behavior, when life squeezes us we may not like what comes out.",
