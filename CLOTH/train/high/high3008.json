Every summer we put our stuff and ourselves into the car and drive 1,000 miles to reach Vero Beach, Florida.\nOnce we get there, it's all about  _  at the beach. I've wanted to be a  _  for a long time. My mom used to surf when she lived in Florida during college. I  _  my mom to let me surf, and she promised to find a surfing  _  for me. He found me instead.\nOne day when my mom was taking an old surfboard to a surf shop for  _  , a surfer  _  the door open for her and helped her carry the board inside. They started  _  and she learned he's a surfing  _  . My mom asked him if he had any  _  working with people with disabilities. He did and told her he would love to work with me. That's how I  _  my friend, Coach Bill Bolton, in 2014.\nFirst Coach Bill taught me the pop-up. I had so much fun surfing with Coach Bill in 2014,  _  I didn't make it to  _  on the board.\nWhen we went to Florida this summer, I had more surfing  _  with Coach Bill. We worked hard on the sand and in the water. On our third day together we  _  our surfboards out past a sand bar where small waves were  _  . I came close to standing each time, and on the last  _  of the day I got up on my feet and stayed up! I was so  _  ! So was Coach Bill.\nWe went to the same surfing spot the next day. Guess what! I  got up  so many times and rode wave after wave. Coach Bill called me a \"surf goddess\". It was one of the  _  days ever! I hope my story  _  you to go surfing or to try something new. I know you can do it.",
