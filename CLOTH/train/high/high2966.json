When several members of the group turned in his  _  , he brushed the front of his Tshirt as though to  _  dust, and, in a gesture clearly meaning to  _  us, rolled up the right sleeve of his shirt, further showing his welldeveloped  _  . \nCory had  _  of playing professional baseball someday. No one doubted Cory's  _  . But that was before the car accident. Not only did Cory lose a  _  in the accident but his hope and his spirit.\nSeeing such a large audience, Subira couldn't wait to give the crowd a  _  of her skills. \"How fast she runs!\" one shouted. \"But she only has three legs.\" one cried. \nNo one was more  _  than Cory. He stared at the animal with the missing leg and he smiled, tears of hope in his  _  . \nLooking  _  into Cory's face, the organizer explained \"It was soon after she came to us that she showed her own worth ---- a  _  gift of love and spirit.
