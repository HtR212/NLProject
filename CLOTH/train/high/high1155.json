Yes, there were probably at least fifty other people around me, but what they had to  _  wasn't what I  _  today.\nI was trying to decide what  _  I was going to have for dinner in the produce section  _  I could hear two girls laughing and whispering.\nOne of the girls asked me how to choose the right cantaloupe  . I  _  what little knowledge I had about placing two thumbs near the  _  and pressing on it to see how  _  it was. I spoke about the color and smell around that core. I took the time to help them  _  one.\nI really felt like I knew what I was  _  about and because they asked me, I felt good about helping.\nThey were  _  and I went about my business. Suddenly one of the girls walked up to me and said, \"Can you keep a  _  ?\" A bit confused and stunned, I replied, \"I believe I  _  .\" Then she  _  toward me with her two hands cupped together as if she was going to  _  me something.\n\"Now it's yours, \" she said  _  she placed her hands in mine and smiled and walked away.\nThere was nothing in her hands.\nThere was nothing in mine, although,  _  I felt like I was holding something. Apparently it was a secret. The girls disappeared into the next aisle and I never  _  either one again.\nOkay, some of you are just shrugging this off as some  _  game. Perhaps they even made a fool of me without me realizing it.\nI guess it's the easiest secret to  _  because I don't know what it is.",
