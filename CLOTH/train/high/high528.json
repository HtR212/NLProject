    "article": "One day a young man was standing in the middle of the town claiming  that he had the most beautiful heart in the whole country. A large crowd gathered,and they all agreed that his heart was  _  because there was not a single scar  in it. The young man was very proud.\nSuddenly, an old man appeared and said, \"Why, your heart is not nearly as beautiful as  _  .\"The crowd and the young man looked at the old man's  _  . It was  _  strongly, but full of scars. It had places  _  pieces had been removed and other pieces put in, but they didn't fit quite right, and there were several  _  edges. In fact, in some places there were deep gaps  where whole pieces were missing.\nThe young man laughed. \"  _  your heart with mine, anyone with his eyes can see mine is perfect and yours is a mess of scars.\"\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, \"Yours looks perfect but I  _  never trade with you. You see, every  _  represents a person  to whom  I have given my love. I tear out a piece of my heart and give it to them, and often they   _  me a piece of their heart that fits into the   _  place in my heart. But because the pieces aren't exact, I have some rough edges, which I treasure, because they remind me of the love we  _  .\n\"Sometimes I have given pieces of my heart  _  , and the other person hasn't returned a    _  of his or her heart to me. These are the empty gaps--giving love is  _  a chance. Although these gaps are painful, they  _  open, reminding me of the love I have for those people too, and I hope someday they may return where I have been waiting and fill the space. So now do you see what true beauty is?''\nTears running his cheeks, the young man walked up to the old man,  reached into  his own perfect heart, and tore out a piece. He  _  it to the old man with trembling hands.\nThe old man placed it in his heart, then took a piece from his old scarred heart and placed it in the wound in the young man's heart. It  _  , but not perfectly, as there were some rough edges.\nThe young man looked at his heart, not perfect any more but more beautiful than ever, since love from the old man's heart flowed into his.\nThey hugged and walked away side by side.",
