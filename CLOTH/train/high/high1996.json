    "article": "There was a time in my life when beauty meant something special to me. I lived in an orphanage    and one Saturday morning after breakfast I returned to the dormitory and saw the house parent   _   the beautiful monarch  butterflies. I carefully watched as he caught these beautiful creatures, one after another, took them from the net and then   _   straight pins through their head and wings, pinning them onto a heavy cardboard sheet. \nHow   _   it was to kill something of such beauty. When he went inside to   _   the phone, I walked up to the cardboard and looked at the butterfly who he had just pinned to the large paper. It was still moving about, so I   reached down  and touched it on the wing,   _   one of the pins to fall out. It started flying around and around trying to get away,   _  it was still pinned by one wing with the other straight pin.  _  , its wing broke down and the butterfly fell to the  _  and just quivered  . \nThe next thing I remembered was that the house parent came back and started   _   at me. I told him that I did not do anything but he did not  _   me. He picked up the cardboard paper and started   _   me on the top of the head. He threw the   _   down on the ground and told me to pick it up and put it in the garbage can and then he left. I sat there in the dirt, trying to fit all the butterfly   _   back together so I could   _   them whole, but it was too   _   to do so. So I   _   for them and then I put them in a box and buried them in the bottom of the fort   that I had   _  in the ground near the blackberry bushes. \nEvery year when the butterflies would return to the orphanage and try to land on me I would  _  them away because they did not know that the orphanage was a  _  place to live and a very bad  place to die.",
