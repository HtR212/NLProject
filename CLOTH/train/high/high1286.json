This is   _   the British government would like to increase the availability of nursery education and to improve teaching   _   in nursery schools. Education   _   the age of 16 is also important. When young people leave school at 16 without   _  , it is very hard for them to find interesting and well-paid work.\nOne   _   to improve education is to pay good teachers more money. But this idea is not popular   _   teachers because they do not like the idea that people who do the same job should get different  _   of pay. Another proposal is to improve careers   _   to young people in school. In this way, they will   _   understand the opportunities that exist and the qualifications that are needed.\nFamily   _   remains important in influencing a young person's   _   of improvement. Families that   _   learning and help their children at school give their children a better chance of success. But the   _   is that too many families do not   _   the importance of education. Children in these families miss big opportunities to develop and grow as   _  .\nIt is not easy to find ways of helping families encourage their children to learn and to have   _   for success. Some people have suggested that parents should   _   lessons on how to be good parents. But a lot of people don't agree with this idea. They say that the government should not   _   in private family life. \nCertainly, it is good to live in a society that allows people to  _   their position, but it is not so easy to put   _   practice.",
