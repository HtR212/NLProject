    "article": "\"So, how's your brother doing?\" Such a common question nowadays. I   used to   give long answers on what he was doing each day of the week, but now I just respond, \"He's fine.\" I've gotten   _  of the question. While everyone wants to know how my brother is doing, no one   _   asks me how I'm doing.\nI lived with him for over seventeen years of my life, and for some reason, no one thinks it would be  _   for me to let him go. But it is. He was the   _  of my world. My entire life went around him. I wore what he wore. If it was fifty degree outside, and he wore shorts, I   _  wear shorts, too.\nI lived in my brother's   _  for over seventeen years. He was popular with everyone. Before, I thought that people liked me. But no. People liked my brother. They were  _  to him, and I just happened to be there.   _   now, away from him, I'm facing a world so much bigger than before. He used to   _  me from the brunt  of the adult stuff, and I walked   _  him, only seeing the nice stuff.\nBut now I can see   _  the world is really like. And I'm ready to   _   it on my own. I may never be popular, but I can be friendly and make new friends. I'm ready to step out from his shadow and let my own shadow fall on the ground. Maybe they won't like me.   _  , it's better than just being a copy of him. It's time to   step out   from behind his shadow. It's time to let the sun warm me up, instead of standing in my brother's cold shadow.",
