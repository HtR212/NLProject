    "article": "One afternoon last summer I was driving along on my way home when I noticed a woman at the roadside near the edge of town. She was  struggling with  a wheeled suitcase and was having a rough way to go since there was no sidewalk, only grass.\nI pulled over to a nearby parking lot to  _  her. I suspected that she was  heading for  the homeless shelter across the street.  _  it became apparent that she was on her way somewhere, I continued to observe. She appeared to be in her fifties and was dressed very  _  , a skirt nearly to her ankles, a blouse, and a lace shawl around her shoulders. In truth, I was not only  _  her situation but whether or not she had the  _  to harm me if I intervened  .\nAfter a couple of minutes I turned around, pulled the car up next to her and offered her a  _  . She accepted. Her story was  _  , but she did share that she had been travelling for a while and that  _  had helped her along the way. Her  _  was a city about three hours drive from where we were and it didn't sound as though she had a place to go there. I offered to take her to the half way point and she accepted.\nAlong the way, we stopped for food and drink for her which she  _  on paying for with her own money. When we well reached the town I had agreed to take her to, she asked if we could stop at a grocery store.\nI was  _  that by this time she had developed enough  _  in me to leave her suitcase in the car while she shopped. While she was inside I located a Holiday Inn nearby and  _  ahead to see if there were  _  ; I explained my rather unusual situation to the person on the other  _  of the phone.\nUpon her  _  from the grocery store, I shared what I had done and she  _  my offer of a room for the night. We drove to the  _  and the kind young woman there provided what discounts she could as well as a room with a refrigerator. She stated that she was touched that \"people don't do this kind of thing.\"",
