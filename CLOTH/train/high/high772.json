After all, which woman can   _   wearing something that makes her look taller and her legs   _   longer? Unfortunately, those high heel shoes women love so much   live up to   their name, and can end up doing more damage than you can imagine   _   the spine  and lower back--if care is not taken.\nMurlowska, a therapist( ), is   _   with the consequences of wearing high heels. A majority of   _   who arrive at Murlowska's office come to her with back and lower back problems. Very often the   _   are the result of not walking properly in high heels or choosing the   _   kind of footwear.\n\"I know women love wearing high heels but they can   _   extreme damage to the body,\" Murlowska says, \"I recently had a patient who had a terrible fall while walking in high heels and twisted her   _  . She did not think much of it at the time, but the next morning she   _   up to find her knee swollen and painful.\"\nIf a woman walks in heels   _   than five centimeters, several pressure points develop in various parts of the body which experience   _  . Essentially, a woman wearing high heels is attempting to   _   her entire body on a very small area. This causes extreme stress on the muscles of the legs   _   increasing the chances of the ankle getting twisted. This can   result in   damage to the knee ligaments  and tendons . High heels force the   _   into an unnatural down-turned position. Consequently, the rest of the body has to   _   itself in order to stay balanced. The lower part of the spine as well as the hip bone tilts  forward while the   _   spine and the neck tilts back in order to maintain balance.\"\nOver a period of time, the hip bone also gets   _   because of the change in the center of gravity as a result of wearing high heels.",
