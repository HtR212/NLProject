    "article": "In schools all over the world boys and girls are learning foreign languages.  Everybody  knows his own language, but  another one  is very useful, especially when we travel to other countries. If we go to France, we ought to be able to speak  _  , and in Germany people will  _  us to understand German.\nHow many languages are there in the world? There are about fifteen hundred, but many of them are not very  _  . English is one of the most important languages  _  so many people use it, not only in England and the USA,  _  in other parts of the world. More than 200 million people speak it  _  their native language, and about another 200 million people use it as a second language. It is  _  to say how many people are learning it. Many millions of school boys and school girls are trying to do so.\nEnglish children study French,  _  is also a very important language. An Englishman can  _  find someone in almost all parts of the world who is able to talk to him in either English or  _  .\nWhich is the best way to learn a language? We should remember that we all learnt our own language well when we were children. If we could learn a second language in the same way, it would not seem so  _  . Think of what a child  _  . It listens to what people say, and it tries to imitate  what it hears. When it wants something, it  has to  ask for it. It is  _  the language, talking in it, and thinking in it all the time. If people had to use a second language all the time, they would learn it quickly.\n  _  is also important to remember that we learn our own language by hearing people speak it, not by seeing  _  they write. We imitate what we hear. In school,  although  you learn to read and write as well as to hear and speak, it is  _  to learn all the new words first through the ear. You can read them, spell them, and write them later.",
