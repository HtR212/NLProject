Most of the findings are predictable, but a few are   _  .\nThe database  makes it   _   that there is not a strong connection between material wealth and general contentment. It is a cliche  to say that money   _   buy happiness, but the old saying seems to be   _   by research. Many people still stick to the belief that gaining riches will be the answer to all their problems, yet they are probably   _  .\nStudies have been   carried out   on people who acquired sudden wealth, such as lottery winners. In most cases, after the initial joy had   worn off  ,  people were not left with a sense of lasting happiness. In fact, they   _   to return to the way they felt before they became rich.  _   contented people continue to be contented,  _   those who were miserable in the past sink back into misery.\nIf material wealth does not bring happiness, then   _   does? Perhaps happiness has something to do with   _   you live. The authorities at the World Database of Happiness have surveyed levels of happiness in different   _  . Apparently, people in America, Canada, and Singapore are very happy; people living in India and Russia, not surprisingly, are not happy.\nOther surveys consistently point to the importance of relationships. Family relationships,  in particular  , seem to be the key to long-term contentment. The Web site suggests that   _   in love and having children are two of the situations that bring the greatest happiness.\nNowadays people look to   _   as an alternative source of satisfaction. People increasingly spend more time alone watching TV or surfing the Internet   rather than   spending time with family. Can technology truly make people happy? It is too difficult to tell, but one thing is sure: If the Web site's research is   _  , time spent with your family is a better investment than time spent making money.",
