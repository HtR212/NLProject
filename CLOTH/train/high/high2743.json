Looking at the man, the owner Abigail asked, \"Why don't you have a   _  ? You know nothing is given to me for free?\" Marcus   _   that he had \"a lot of crimes\". Because of his   _  , no one wanted to hire him, so he had made money the only way he knew how: \"  _   or asking for money.\"\nAlthough the young owner had hit some hard times for her cafe, Abigail was   _   of hands that day and then decided to   _   Marcus the task of washing dishes. \"His   _   opened wide and his smile made my   _  !\" She wrote on Facebook.\n\"He said he would do   _   for some food.\" For the past two weeks, Marcus has been on time every day for his   _   of working for two hours when he washes dishes. He uses the money he   _   to buy his own food at the restaurant,   _   to take it for free.\n\"A lot of people are saying that I've been a blessing for him.   _  , at that point I was the one who needed a blessing,\" Abigail told CBS News. Her post has earned a lot of attention with plenty of   _   on the Internet. Because many people have asked   _   they can help people like Marcus, she   set up   a GoFundMe page with a modest goal of $1,000. \"The hope,\" she said, \"is to create more hours and opportunities for him   as well as   others in the community.\"\nAbigail said she shared the story, hoping that people might be moved to help a   _  , too. \"Do something nice for whoever may not be familiar to us and don't   _   them just because they go out there asking for money, for we don't know their real   _  ,\" she said in her post. \"They deserve another chance.\"",
