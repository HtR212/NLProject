Yet it remains in my memory that she taught me a lesson in  _  that I shall never forget. On a winter afternoon, my fellows and I were throwing stones onto the slanted roof of the old lady's house to observe how the stones  _  off the roof's edge and shot out like missiles. I found a  _  smooth rock and threw it out, but it  _  straight not for the roof but for a small window of the old lady's house.  _  the sound of broken glass, we knew we were in trouble. We ran faster than any of our  _  flew off her roof. I was so  _  about getting caught that first night  _  I was not concerned about the old lady with the broken window in winter.  _  , a few days later I started to feel guilty for her misfortune. She  _  greeted me with a smile when I gave her the newspaper, but I was no longer able to act  _  I  made up  my mind that I would save my newspaper delivery money, and in three weeks I had seven dollars. I put the money in an envelop with a  _  explaining that I was sorry for breaking her window and hope that the seven dollars would  _  the cost for repairing it. I waited until it was  _  to avoid being seen, and put the letter I didn't  _  into her yard. To my relief, I could have the  _  of, once again, looking straight into the old lady's kind eyes. The next day, I handed the old lady her newspaper. She thanked me and gave me a bag of cookies she had made herself.  _  eating cookies, I felt an envelope and pulled it out of the bag. After opening it, I was shocked. Inside were the seven dollars and a short note  _  , \"I'm proud of you.\"",
