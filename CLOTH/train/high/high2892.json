    "article": "Which came first, the chicken or the egg? This is one of life's  _  questions and people have been debating about it for thousands of years. Now scientists believe they have solved this  _  . Researchers from Sheffield and Warwick Universities in England discovered the answer  by chance  . They used a super computer to observe the shell-making process while a new shell was  _  . Then they found one protein called OC17 that is  _  for forming eggshell. This is only found inside a chicken's body, which is proof that the  _  came first. The team was  _  looking at how animals and birds make eggshells but suddenly made their surprising  _  . The big question now is where chickens came from. The  _  is from dinosaurs. The research team said eggshells are one of nature's most  _  creations. Professor John Harding from the team told reporters: \"Understanding how chickens make eggshells is fascinating in itself, but it can also be  _  in designing new materials.\" Eggshells are very lightweight but incredibly strong. Even the most up-to-date materials  _  by the world's top engineers can not produce anything as  _  as an eggshell. Professor Harding added that  _  eggshells could help to cure bone diseases and design materials for the construction industry.\"Nature has found wonderful ways that  _  for all kinds of problems in materials science and technology -- we can learn a lot from them.\" he said.",
