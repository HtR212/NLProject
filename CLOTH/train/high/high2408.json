    "article": "I remembered my parents ran a small restaurant in Seattle. It was open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and my first   _  job, when I was six years old, was   _  diner's shoes. My father had done it when he was young, so he taught me   _  to do it right, telling me to offer to re-shine the shoes if the customer wasn't   _  .\nWorking in the restaurant was a   _  of great pride\nbecause I was also working for the   _  of the whole family. But my father\nmade it clear I had to   _  certain standards to be part of the team. I had\nto be punctual, hard-working and   _  to the customers.\nI was   _  paid for my work I did at the\nrestaurant. One day I made the mistake of   _  Dad I thought he should give\nme $10 a week. He said, \"OK, then how about you   _  me for the three meals\na day you eat here? And for the times you bring in your buddies for free\nsodas?\" He   _   I owed him about $40 a week.\nI remember   _  home to Seattle after being away in\nthe Army for about two years. I had just been   _   to captain and was full of\npride as I walked into my parents' restaurant. The   _  thing Dad said was,\n\"How about your cleaning up tonight?\" I cannot   _  this! I'm an officer in\nthe US Army! But it didn't matter. As far as Dad was   _  , I was just\nanother member of the team. I   reached for  the mop. Working for Dad had taught me\nthat loyalty   _  a team comes first. It doesn't matter   whether  that team is\ninvolved in a family restaurant or Operation Desert Storm.",
