He was kind to me, but I had no  _  that he took particular notice of me. There were other  _  kids in the class, and soon I fell back into my usual  _  and thought that I was just a little over average in most things. Near the end of the term, we began to read the play--Macbeth. Believe me, this is not an easy play for high school students to understand,  _  I spent a lot of time reading it. After working till the night before it was due, I wrote a paper about the  _  -- the first paper I typed on a typewriter -- and turned it  _  the next day. I got a good  _  on it, and below the grade Mr. Wilson wrote, \"Sure  _  you become a writer.\" That was it. Those six words were written in his clear and neat handwriting. It was the first time he or anyone had  _  in any way that writing was a  _  option for me. We'd never had any writers in our family line, and we didn't know any writers personally, even  _  , so writing for a living didn't seem something  _  to me. But then, just like that, Jay Wilson tapped my hidden  _  and let me see a wider world. Over the next 10 years, I often  _  about Mr. Wilson's six words. Whenever I felt discouraged, it was those six words that came back to me and gave me  _  . When a few instructors in college gently and not-so-gently tried to tell me I had no talent, I held Mr. Wilson's  _  before me to protect myself. I didn't  _  what anyone else thought. Mr. Wilson, head of the whole English department at Lake Forest High,  _  I could be a writer. So I put my head down and struggled forward. 396",
