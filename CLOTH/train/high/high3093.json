    "article": "One day when I was about nine years old, I ran into my mother's bedroom and opened the dresser . Then in the top drawer, was a small  _  jewelry box. I was fascinated by its treasures. Then I saw there was something  _  under the piece of red cloth.  _  the cloth, I found a little white chip of china . Why did my mother keep this  _  thing? Shining slightly in the light,  _  no answers. Some months later,I was setting the dinner table when my neighbour Marge knocked at the door. Coming in and  glancing at  the table, Marge said, \"Oh, you are expecting company. I'll  stop by  another time.\"\n\"No, come on in.\"Mom replied .\"We are not  _  anyone.\"\n\"But isn't that your good china?\" Marge asked. \"I'd  _  trust kids to handle my good dishes!\"\nMom laughed.\"Tonight's my family's favorite meal. If you set your best table for a(n)  _  meal with guests, why not for your own  _  ?A few broken plates are a small  _  to pay for the joy we get using them\" Then she added .\"  _  every chip and crack has a story to tell.\"\nMom went to the cupboard and took down a plate. She said, \"Seeing this  _  on the edge here ? It happened when I was 17\".\nHer voice  _  , \"One day my brother invited a young man to dinner and sat him next to me. I was so  _  that when I look the plate, it  _  and knocked against the fork. As the young man was leaving, he  _  a piece of broken china in my hand without saying a word.\"\nI couldn't forget about that plate with the  _  chip. I went up to take out the little wooden jewelry box again. I examined the chip  _  .The chip mother had saved with care belonged to the plate she broke on the day she met my father.",
