    "article": "Once upon a time when I was young,I watched fearfully as my little brother was caught in the act. He sat in the comer of the living room, a pen in one hand and my father's new   _     in the other.\nAs our father walked into the room,my brother cowered  slightly; he sensed that he had done something  _  . He had scribbled   on the first page with the pen. Now,he and I both  waited for  our father's punishment. And as we waited, there was no way we could have known that he was about to   _  us one of his deep and lasting lessons about life and family,lessons that continue to become   _  clearer to me through the years.\nMy father   picked up  his\nbook and looked at it carefully without saying a word. Books were  _  to him. For him,books were knowledge,and   _  he\nloved his children. What he did next was remarkable  . Instead of   _  my brother,instead of scolding him,he   _  the pen from my brother's hand and\nthen wrote in the book  _  :\"John's work,1959,age 2. Thank God for the one who has just   _     in my new book. You have made the book sacred.\"  \nThe years and the books came and   _  ,Our family expe rienced everything that 0ther families.  went through  .\nWe always knew our father loved us and that one of the  _  of\nhis love was that book. From time to time we would  _  it,look at the scribbles, and read our father's   _  of love.\nNow I understand that   _  this simple act my father taught us that every event in life has a  _  side - if we are prepared to look at it from another angle - and how\nprecious it is when our lives are touched by little hands. And lie also taught\nus what really  _  in life: people,not objects; tolerance,not judgment;and love,not anger.",
