    "article": "It was the first weekend after Christmas and all I wanted to do was lie on the sofa and watch TV. However , I had two lawns to mow   .Too bad ! I   _  \nFive years ago my 72-year-old next-door neighbor fell down in the driveway. We both   _  to be working on our lawns that day.  _  for us ,we'd\nstopped to chat. I  _  Glen before his head hit the ground.\nHe lay semiconscious   in my   _  until the ambulance arrived .\nI rode with Glen and his wife , Grace , to the hospital. Over the next few weeks , I cut his lawn.Glen   _  fully recovered. He could hardly walk.Within two years , he was dead. I\nhad  _  for Grace .With nobody else to help ,I 'd\nbeen attending her lawn  ever since  . I liked to think someone would\ntake care of my lawn for my  _  if anything like that\nhappened to me .\nBut that didn't make the promise any   _  . I needed to buy twice as much gas--not  _  . Besides, my old mower regularly  broke down  .Grace let me use\nGlen's lawnmower and chipped in  for   _  , but eventually that mower\nalso started going wrong. I admired the fancy new models  _  .\n\"Light as a feather.\" \"Almost does the job itself.\" But it was  _  me\nright now.\n\"Glen would do it for me,\" I   _  myself as I walked to Grace's  _  .Maybe I just\ndidn't want to spend the post-Christmas day cutting grass with that terrible\nmower,  _  I wanted to let Grace down even less.\nI opened the garage door.The old lawnmower was  _  . In its place sat the latest mower on the\nmarket.  _  to it ,a sign read, \"Merry Christmas, Joe. Hope you\nlike your new lawnmower. \" One gentle pull of the starter rope ,and it came to\nlife. It was Christmas all over again.",
