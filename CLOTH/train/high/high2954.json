I  _  what had happened in a crowded store when there was a  _  of shopping carts a few days ago.\nA well-dressed man, together with his wife and a child, was  _  a cart when another man stopped him. \"Excuse me,\" the second man said, \"  _  this cart is what I brought here. It's mine.\" The first guy looked rather  _  and then became annoyed. Instead of  _  , he protested, \"But someone took my cart!\" At that moment, his wife also glared at him, so he unwillingly  gave up  his ill-gotten gain. The well-dressed man had  _  the useful saying that \"Do to others as you would have others do to you.\"  _  , there are often some shoppers who have changed their minds about  _  some items and put what they have chosen on the  _  shelf. They think that the store  _  shop assistants who should put the things they give up  _  . In the opinion of these fellows, does that mean it's OK for kids to  _  their rubbish on the floor or everywhere because schools employ  _  to clean the hall? In the  _  , there are express-line cheaters who enter the \"10 items or less\" line with 14 items because they're in a hurry or  _  because they are unwilling to queue up. They don't think that someone will  _  them behaving immorally. Even if someone finds them out, they're ready to  _  that \"It depends on what you call an item.\"\nI consider these fellows as a black sheep and there are a small number of such people. In our society we should be  _  , and play by the rules. It is important for us to set a good example to our kids, even in the grocery store.",
