As they walked along, the woodcutter explained the   _    of each tree is decided by its    _  shape: some are straight for planks   and some are    _     for masts  . By paying attention to the    _      of each tree, and with experience in     _    these characteristics, someday he too might become the    _     of the forest.\nA little way leading to the forest, the grandson saw an old oak tree that had never been      _    . The boy asked his grandfather if he could cut it down because it was   _    for boat building --there were no straight limbs   and the     _     was short. \"We could cut it down for    _    ,\" the grandson said. \"  At least    , it will be of some use to us.\"\nThe woodcutter replied that now they should pay attention to their work--cutting the    _    trees for the boat builders; maybe later they could     _    to the old oak tree.\nAfter a few hours of cutting, the grandson grew    _     and asked if they could stop for a rest in some cool shade. The woodcutter took his grandson over to the old oak tree, where they     _    against its trunk under the cool shade. After a while, the woodcutter explained to his grandson, \"You must    _      to pay careful attention every day. For it is this old oak tree, which you so    _     considered useless except for firewood, that now     _     us to rest against its trunk in the coolness of its shade. Remember, grandson, not everything is as it     _      appears.\"",
