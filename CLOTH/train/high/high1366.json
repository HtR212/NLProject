A Fermi problem does not   _   all the information you need to solve it precisely.\nWhat does this have to do with business or creativity? A great deal. In the real world, we frequently need to make decisions when the   _   of information does not exist. Most often there may not be the time or the money to make sure of all your   _   , so your best guess will often be the best you can do.\nFermi is said to have once asked his university students how many piano tuners there were in Chicago. To answer the question, he recommended   _   it down into smaller, more   _   questions, and then having the   _   to make some guesses and assumptions. How many people live in Chicago? Three million would be a reasonable estimate. How many people per family? Assume a/an   _   of four. How many families own pianos?   _   one out of three. Then there are about 250,000 pianos in Chicago.   How often   would each be tuned? Maybe once every five years. That   _   50,000 tunings a year. How many pianos can one tuner tune in a day? Four? And how many in a year? Assuming 250 working days, one tuner can   _   1,000 pianos a year.\nSo there's work for   _   50 piano tuners in Chicago -- which, as it turns out, is   _   close to the actual number in the Yellow Pages.\nWhy was guesswork so accurate? The law of averages is partly   _  . At any point, your assumptions may be too high or too low. But because of the law of averages, your mistakes, will frequently balance out.",
