I found myself asking, \"  _  does all this not give me real happiness?\" Newspapers said, \"Kriss Akabusi is the European champion. He has also  _  an Olympic bronze medal.\" Now before all this happened, I had  _  , \"If I can become a champion, I will be happy. I will  _  a lot of money and then enjoy  _  . I will have a good time.\" When I went to the Edinburgh Games, in my hotel  _  I found a book by my bedside. It was called What's Real Happiness in Life? I  _  this book up and read some of the stories in it. The book mainly told about the happiness brought by helping others. But I said to  _  , \"All these things are too  _  for me to do.\" But that night I had a  _  . I found myself standing by a river. I  _  a voice calling to me from the other side of the river. The voice said, \"You know helping others is as  _  as crossing the river, and it's not as difficult as you imagine.\" Then suddenly I awoke. I realized I was  _  now when compared to before. I found I had real  _  of mind. So I can now tell my friends what I have  _  . Being famous and having a lot of money  _  gave me happiness. So all I can say to you is this--we are  _  when we think that to be famous and rich will make us happy. Now I have a children's TV program called Record Breakers. I have no  _  about what tomorrow will bring.",
