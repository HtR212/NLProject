    "article": "Once , there were several researchers in the forest ,trying to study the rarest creature in the world . No one had   _   it , and its existence  was only known by some remains, and by its call . The call was   _  and different from other animals .\nEveryone wanted to be the   _   to photograph and study it . The animal was   _   at night ,so during the day the researchers would study or discuss other matters to   _  their time . The most   _  of them was Sir Walter Tick-Fondler . Every day , he would spend an hour sitting at his desk , putting all his things in their   _   place . This gentleman was such a perfect example of the famous English obsession  with order .\nThe researchers spent many nights in that area   _  the creature appeared , and before it did so some of them even   _  its existence . It appeared  _   , while everything was quiet .\nOnly a few meters away , the researchers heard its call .   _   , it lasted only a short period of time . All the noise of the researchers   looking for  their cameras and notebooks scared the creature , and it   _  away before it could be seen clearly or studied in any detail .\nThe next morning they all compared their   _  . Some had managed to   _   its call ,others had noted down how it moved , and the most   _  of all had even managed to photograph parts of its body . They all   _   each other on what they had got , but when they saw what Sir Walter had they were   _   .\nHe had taken several   _   photos of the creature ! They could see the whole creature clearly !\nThey now   _  that his obsession with order had been the best way to prepare himself for working in the dark .",
