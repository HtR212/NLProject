    "article": "The story I'm going to tell truly happened in my life. The other day, I met a man outside the gym who  looked like  a movie star. He was handsome and smiling. His upper body was muscular and he  _  to be on top of the world. \"How are you?\" I  _  with a smile. \"I'm doing really well,\" he replied in a cheerful voice. His enthusiasm and big smile  lit up  the parking garage.  _  as he walked up, I  _  his long legs were thin and I saw he had a silver cane . \"Why do you need that cane?\" I couldn't  _  thinking he had a minor injury. \"I have MS,\" he answered in a  _  voice too, as if his broad smile  _  left his face. Multiple Sclerosis is a very serious disease and often painful. I looked at him from my little red sports car and said, \"You  _  it very well. You seem like a happy man  in spite of  the MS.\" Without losing a bit of his smile he replied, \"I am a happy man,\" and then added, \"I'd be even happier if I had that sports  _  .\" It was ironic . Just  _  we spoke, I'd been sitting in that little sports car, feeling sad about my painful shoulder over the last 11 months as I was  _  after an operation. Here's a man with a  _  far tougher than mine, but his positive attitude made him feel no less happiness. He went on with his  _  of life as usual, which moved me deeply. It was also a wonderful reminder of that old  _  , \"I cried because I had no shoes. Then I met a man who had no feet.\"  _  your problems, just keep in  _  that none of us goes through life  _  and you should make the most of what you have, like the man with MS. Count your blessings.",
