    "article": "Many years ago ,l was working at my job at a community college when a homeless woman came in. She began  _  as she lay on one of the sofas in the student rest room.  _  she wasn't well. Without thinking too much I went next door to the Student Affairs office where I knew I could find  _  in the Lost and Found box. I  _  up a set of clothing and went back to my office,  _  I heard a colleague calling me. She told me that I should not  _  this person, as it would only lead to her wanting more help. I refused her  _  and went back to help the woman,  regardless of  my co-worker's warning . Two weeks later, while I was working, a very cute elderly man entered my  _  and asked to speak with me in private. Curiously, l gave him my full  _  and he told me that he had happened to hear my  _  with the co-worker about helping the  _  woman. He wanted me to know that it was always okay to help people and that was why he wanted to give me a  _  for $1,000. I burst into tears, because I  _  needed the money at the time, but also because I had never been  _  in such a way for helping someone! We soon became good  _  and 10 years later he called me up suddenly and told me he wanted to help me  _  my first home! He  ended up  giving me $120,000 as part payment for my dream house in my home town. I asked him why he wanted to give me such a large amount of money and he said it was because I was a \" giver\" and that I  _  it ! To make a long story short, l was able to buy the perfect little home for myself, all because one day I did not  _  to help a homeless woman.",
