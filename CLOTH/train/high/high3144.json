During lifetime, however, it turns out to be a  _  and we always think of making it up when it's gone.\nA father sat at his desk staring at his monthly bills  _  his young son rushed in and  _  , \"Dad, because this is your birthday and you're 55 years old, I'm going to give you 55  _  , one for each year!\" When the boy started making good on his  _  , the father exclaimed, \"Oh, Andrew, don't do it now; I'm too  _  !\" The youngster immediately fell silent as tears  _  up in his big blue eyes.  _  the father said, \"You can finish  _  .\"\nThe boy said nothing but quietly  walked away  , disappointment written  _  his face. That evening the father said, \"Come and finish the  _  kisses now, Andrew!\" But the boy didn't respond.\nUnfortunately, a few days later after this  _  , the boy had an accident and was drowned. His heartbroken father wrote, \"If only I could tell him how much I regret my  _  words, and could be assured that he knows how much my heart is  _  .\"\n......\nLove is a two-way street. Any loving act must be warmly accepted  _  it will be taken as  _  and can leave a scar. If we are too busy to give and  _  love, we are too busy! Nothing is more important than  _  with love to the cry for love from those who are near and precious to us. Because...there may be no  _  at all as in the case of the little boy.",
