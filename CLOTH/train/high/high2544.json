    "article": "Years ago, I worked at the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus. One day, as I was passing the elephants, I suddenly stopped,  _  by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. It was  _  that they could, at any time, break free,  _  strangely enough, they didn't. I asked a trainer the  _  for this. He said, \"When they were very young we used the  _  size rope, and it was enough to hold them. As they grow up, they believe the rope can  _  hold them, so they never try.\" Like the elephants, how many of you believe you cannot do a thing, simply because you  _  once before? Do you often tell  yourself  \"I cannot dance\" or \"I'm not good at math\"? These are  _  of self limiting beliefs. You must realize you're  _  for them. A limiting belief that says you're poor at math may have  _  as a reaction to the embarrassing experiences related to math, or the remarks made by someone important to you which  _  you. The cool thing is that because you create the  _  you can choose to change it! Here is how: First,  _  it with \"I am good at math\". Once you change your  _  , your subconsciousness will make this  come true  by driving you to act. That might be to take a math course or to go online  _  help, etc. Gradually you'll really see your math skills are  _  . This is such a simple process that you can  _  it today. Don't be like the poor elephant and make your life  _  at a place because of a limiting belief you developed years ago.",
