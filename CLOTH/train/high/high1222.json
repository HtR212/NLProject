A lot of other neighbourhood children were told the same from their parents. As he was  _  to walk away, the door slowly opened. \"What do you want?\" the old man asked. The little boy was very afraid at first. \"Uh, sir, I'm selling these magazines and I was wondering if you'd like to buy  _  .\" The old man just stared at the boy. The boy could see that he had  _  figurines on a table near the door.\"Do you collect dogs?\" the boy asked. \"Yes, I do.They're my families here.\" The boy then  was sorry for  the man, as it seemed that he was a very lonely person. \"Well, I do have a magazine here for collectors. It's very good for  _  , especially with a cover about dogs.\" The old man was ready to close the door and said, \"No, boy, I don't need any  _  .\" The boy was sad that he was not going to finish his job for the day. He also felt sad  _  the old man being so alone in the big house. The boy went home and then had a/an  _  . He had a little dog figurine that he got from his aunt. The figurine did not mean  _  to him because he had a lovely dog and a large family. The boy  _  back for the old man's house with the figurine. He knocked at the door again and the old man came to the door. \"Boy, I thought I had told you I didn't need magazines.\" \"No, sir,  _  I wanted to bring you a gift.\" The boy handed him the figurine and the old man's face  lit up  . \"I have one at home. This one is for you.\" The old man was simply  _  ; no one had ever shown him so much  _  . From that day on the old man started coming out of the house and talking with people. He and the boy became friends.",
