    "article": "It was about the third week in June last year. My 15yearold son had already settled into his summer routine:Go to  _  at 2 a. m. and wake up at 1 p.m. only to get back on his computer to play computer games  _  dinner. It was the middle of the  _  when the sound of his computer games woke me up again. I couldn't  _  that any more and decided it was time for him to get a summer job. I got on the computer and found a lifeguard certification class that  _  the next day, and a company that  _  teenagers to guard their pools. From that day I woke him up at 8 a.m. every day for him to  _  the class. At first, he continued to complain that I was  _  his summer. But by the end of the week, he was actually  looking forward to  going. He learned something about first aid, figured he really could  _  someone from drowning, and got some ideas on how to  _  work for a living. Two weeks later, he had a  _  as a lifeguard. He took his responsibility very  _  and never went to work late. This summer, he will be working fulltime at a pool. He says a lot of his  _  don't have jobs. And I say that is because their mothers didn't try  _  enough! Even if your kid is super  _  with finals and afterschool activities and doesn't have time, you can  search for  job information for him. Whether it is an ice cream store, a movie  _  , or a summer camp, you can ask if they are hiring  _  for the summer. After your kid gets a job, pay attention to the  _  to make sure he is never late.",
