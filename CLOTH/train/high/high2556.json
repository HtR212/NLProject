    "article": "I was walking in the park with my dog when I saw a notice on a tree saying someone had lost his dog. There was a(n)   _   of the dog as well. I thought what a(n)   _   it was and then I walked on. \n20 minutes later, my dog and I   _   our walk and left the park.   _   at a red traffic light, I glanced over at a nearby lamp post. There was another   _   there, announcing that a dog had been   _  ! \nThere was no photo   _   there was a phone number. \"It couldn't be the   _   dog,\" I thought to myself. \"Could it?\" \nI took out my cell phone, dialed the number and left a message. Then I   _   and walked back over to the \"Dog Lost\" notice. I have to admit I was getting pretty   _   at the possibility of   _   someone. \nWhen I returned to the first notice, I dialed that number. This time a man   picked up   the phone. I told him my  _   and gave him the  _   from the other notice with the \"Dog Found\" information.  He was so happy with the   _   that this might be his dog that he could hardly speak. I hung up,   _   it was a long shot , but   _   that at least I had tried.  \nAbout an hour later my cell phone rang. I answered and heard the best possible news. The owner and his dog were   _  !  He told me how, when he   arrived at   the house where his dog was being looked after, it ran to him and jumped into his arms. He   _   to pay me a reward but I just laughed and said, \"Don't worry about it. Buy the little fellow a doggy treat!\"",
