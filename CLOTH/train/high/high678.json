    "article": "When I was in Germany, one day at Christmas-time I went to a post office to send a letter. To my  _  I found people queuing some paces away from the person at the savings deposit window.  _  so? Each did his business  in turn  but the line never moved a step  _  I was very  _  , so I walked to the window to find out the cause. There was a notice on which was written \"Thank you for your  _  for other's privacy\"--a polite  _  to keep people away from nosing into other's  _  (money matters are regarded as privacy in Western countries). I was deeply impressed by the  _  and stayed a while to watch: they were waiting so  _  at a distance that they seemed quite  _  to the practice. The  _  thing happened at a public telephone box.  _  waiting for their turns always kept their distance--enough to be out of  _  . It's another typical example! From then on I  took care  to watch their ways of doing things, manners, treatment  _  towards others. I found the Germans always mindful of other's privacy. They avoided putting others in an embarrassing situation. For instance, they never  _  about age, incomes or the place to buy such a coat,  nor  would they comment on the others or jewelry others wore. Their laws  _  reading diaries or opening letters without permission. That shows  _  matters are not allowed to be disturbed.",
