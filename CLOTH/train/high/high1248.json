    "article": "I was living in Sao Paulo, Brazil. It is a   _   city, with more people living in it than in my whole country. We rented a flat in a guarded community, but there was a favela  quite   _  . \nFor several months I didn't have a car,   _   three times a week, I took buses to go to the city centre. During these   _  , I would ride with the people who took the same bus from the favela to go to work. When I got on the bus, all the seats were already   _  . But when people saw that my bag was   _  , they offered to hold it on their legs to make me feel lighter   _  . At first, I was   _  . Then I realized that these people had  ly no   _   to steal from me: they only wanted to   _  . \nOnce, on my way back, I had to 41 wait for  a long time at a bus stop. I was   _  , except for a woman who was   _   very poor. She carried a small paper bag of popcorn and nothing else. \nWhile we were waiting, she walked over and   _   me some popcorn. I   _   her, but didn't want to help myself to it. She then repeatedly   _   that I take from what was clearly her   _   food. \nThat was the first time I had thought about how people who have almost nothing are sometimes able to   _   the little they have more \"49 _ \" than those who own a lot. I wonder if it's true that the more you have, the bigger the burden and the difficulty to share anything with others. I was so moved by that woman's simple   _   that day. I clearly had more than she did, but she naturally and joyfully shared what little she had with me.",
