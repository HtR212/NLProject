So one day he  _  God, \"They tell me you are sending me to  _  tomorrow but how am I going to live there being so  _  and helpless?\" God replied, \"Among the many  _  , I chose one for you. She will be  _  for you and will take care of you.\" But the child wasn't  _  he really wanted to go. \"But tell me, here in Heaven, I don't do  _  but sing and smile, that's  _  for me to be happy.\" \"Your angel will sing for you and will also  _  for you every day. And you will  _  your angel's love and be happy.\" \"And  _  am I going to be able to understand when people talk to me.\" The child continued, \"if I don't know the  _  that men talk?\" God patted him on the head and said, \"your angel will tell you the most beautiful and sweet  _  you will ever hear, and with much  _  and care, your angel will teach you how to  _  .\" \"And what am I going to do when I want to talk to you?\" \"Your angel will place your  _  together and will teach you how to pray.\" \"I've heard that on earth there are bad men, who will  _  me?\" \"Your angel will defend you even if it means  _  her life!\" And then God  _  the child on the shoulder and said, \"Your angel's name is not  _  to remember. You will simply call her Mommy.\"",
