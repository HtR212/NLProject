    "article": "Some years ago, Houston airport faced a troubling customer-relations issue. Passengers were making a huge number of   _   about the long waits at baggage claim  . In response, the airport managers   _   the number of baggage handlers. The plan worked: the average wait fell to eight minutes. But the complaints   _   despite the apparent success.\n  _  , the managers undertook a more careful, on-site analysis. They found that it took passengers a minute to walk from their   _   gates to baggage claim and seven more minutes to get their bags. Roughly 88 percent of their time, in other words, was spent standing around   _   waiting for their bags.\nSo the airport decided on a new approach: instead of reducing wait time, it   _   the arrival gates farther away from baggage claim area. Passengers now had to   _   six times longer to get their bags. Complaints dropped to near zero.\nThis story shows a general   _  : the experience of waiting is defined only partly by the actual length of the wait. Often the psychology of queuing is more   _   than the length of the wait itself. Occupied time (walking to baggage claim) feels   shorter   than unoccupied time (standing at baggage claim). Research on   _   has shown that, on average, people overestimate how long they've waited in a line by about 36 percent.\nThis is also why one finds mirrors next to lifts. The spread of high-rise buildings after World War II led to complaints about lift   _  . The motive behind the mirrors was   _   to the one used at the Houston airport: give people something to   _   their time, and the wait seems shorter.",
