    "article": "Many years ago I was on a bicycle trip through the countryside. Suddenly rain began to fall, but strange to   _  , several hundred yards ahead of me the sun shone brilliantly. Riding, however, as rapidly as I could, I found it   _   to get into the clear. The clouds with their rain kept advancing faster than I could race forward. I continued this   _   contest for an exhausting half hour,   _   realizing that I could not win my way to the bright area ahead of me.\nThen it dawned upon me that I was   _   my strength in unimportant hurry, while paying no attention to the landscape   for the sake of   which I was making the trip. Indeed, there was much to   look at   which might otherwise have escaped me. As I gazed  about with sharpened   _  , I saw colours and lines and shapes that would have appeared   _   under brilliant light. The rain mists   and the fresh clearness of the different greens were so   _  . My annoyance at the rain was gone and my eagerness to   _   it disappeared. It had provided me with a new view that the   _   of beauty and satisfaction may be found close at hand within the   _   of one's own sensibilities.\nIt made me think about other matters to which this incident was   _  . I realized that there is no sense in my   _   to flee from circumstances which cannot be avoided. I might just bravely   _   them and they would turn to good account. I know that half the battle is   _   if I can face trouble with courage. It has become ever clearer to   _   that danger is far from disaster, that defeat may be the forerunner of final   _  , and that all achievement is dangerously weak   _   based on enduring principles of moral conduct.",
