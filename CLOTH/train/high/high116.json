Tracy has been  _  since 2008. But this is not a story about the  _  outcome of a young lady. Rather, it is about a man who has stayed  _  to his wife, nursing her night and day, making sure she is as  _  as possible.\nRyan and Tracy  _  in a friend's home in 2003. \"She was beautiful and interesting to talk to,\" Ryan says of his first  _  of Tracy. In 2005, they got married and were very happy. However, a call put the couple's life in  _  a month after their daughter was born. Ryan was at work when a neighbor called to inform him that Tracy had been  _  to the hospital.\n  _  , he ran to the hospital. When he got there, he knew his  _  had been treated for fever. However, the fever did not  go down  after Tracy received that medical treatment.\nTracy's breathing became labored and was  _  to speak. The medical examination  _  she developed an infection damaging her nerve system. Tracy went into a coma  and a few days later, though she regained consciousness, she  _  could not move her lower legs. \"She was admitted to hospital for four months and  _  doctors did all they could, her  _  got worse,\" Ryan says. She could no longer  _  her legs, and lost the ability to give voices.\n\"Those four months are the most  _  time I have ever had. I have never stopped hoping and praying she will regain her  _  ,\" Ryan says with a smile, \"I miss her laughter, and wonder what kind of a mother she would be to our daughter.\"",
