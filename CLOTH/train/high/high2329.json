    "article": "Americans prefer to try every way to have fun, for example, they drive their own cars, some even tow a small boat after vehicle. They start from Los Angeles, California under sun,  _  through four or five hundred miles to go to La Fulin, Colorado to spend weekends while Chinese people are still  _  with work, and have dinner at home together with families in weekends or  _  time watching TV. The difference is mainly due to cultural customs and traditions  _  the two countries. It is said that Chinese people are living for others, while Americans are for  _  . When Chinese people come to the United States, they fight for  _  first, and then desperately make money after they are recognized by others. It seems that, the purpose to earn money is not to enjoy life,  _  for their following generations sons and daughters and even grandchildren. Chinese people prefer to save money  in case of  emergency, such as illness. Although Chinese people with  _  in the United States don't need to worry about their own social welfare and health insurance, they work still very hard, as they hope that they can  _  more money. Chinese people's interest is in the amount on the passbook , so they spend  _  money usually. Most of Chinese are very thrifty , and they are  _  to spend money, but there are exceptions. They are willing to spend money on their  _  . Many Chinese people think that, they endure many  _  , so they wish that their children could live much better. Therefore, in the United States elementary schools, you can see that those who  _  the best, with more pocket money are Chinese students. In contrast, American children dress very simply, with just a little pocket money.  Different from  Chinese, Americans believe in living for themselves. They do everything for their own.  _  , they earn money to enjoy a  _  life, and pursue a higher quality of life. As for their own parents or children, they think that parents have their own pension and social welfare, and children should live a(n)  _  life when they are 18' years old. So they could boldly spend money on themselves.  As a result  , Americans save little money. In the street, it is easy for Chinese to take out 300-400 dollars, but it is hard to say for Americans.",
