Then he said, \"I am going to give this $20 to one of you, but first let me do this.\" He began to crumple the  _  . He then asked the audience, \"  _  still wants it ?\" Still the hands went  _  in the air. \" What  _  I do this? \" He asked, and he  _  it on the ground, and started to step on it. He  _  it up. Now the bill was  _  and crumpled. \" Now who still wants it?\" Still the hands went up. \"My friends,\" He continued, \"You have all  _  a good lesson . No matter  _  I did to the money, you still wanted it because the bill did not lose its  _  . It was still worth $20. Many times in our  _  , we are dropped, crumpled, and stepped on, because we sometimes  _  wrong decisions, or we may  _  with something we do not  _  .When that happens, we feel depressed and think we are  _  . But in fact no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value. The worth of our life comes not  _  what we do or whom we know, but in who we are! Don't forget 'the worth of a thing does not depend on its outside  _  , but on its inner value.' This is the  _  of life.",
