A little boy named Johnny was visiting his grandparents on their farm and he was given a slingshot to play with out in the woods. He  _  for some time but he could never hit the target he had set for himself. Getting a little  _  , he walked back to the farmhouse for dinner. As he was  _  back, he saw Grandpa's pet duck. Just out of  _  , he let the slingshot fly , hitting it in the head ,and killed it. In a panic, he  _  the dead duck in the woodpile, only to see his sister Sally  _  be watching him. Sally had seen all this, but she said  _  . After lunch that day Grandma said, \"Sally, it's your turn to wash the dishes.\" But Sally said, \"Grandma, Johnny told me he wanted to help in the kitchen.\" And then she spoke  _  to him, \"Remember the duck?\" So Johnny did the dishes. Later that day, Grandpa asked if  the children  wanted to go fishing, but Grandma said, \"I'm sorry but I need Sally to help me make supper.\" But Sally just smiled and said, \"Well, that's all right because Johnny told me he was too  _  to help you. And she whispered again, \"Remember the duck?\" So Sally went fishing and Johnny  stayed behind  to help make supper. After several days of doing both his  _  and Sally's, Johnny finally couldn't  _  it any longer. He came to his Grandma and told her that he had killed the duck .Grandma smiled and gave him a big  _  . \"Sweetheart, I know. You see, I was watering the flowers at the window  _  I saw you shoot my duck with the slingshot, and I saw the whole thing. But because I love you, I  _  you. I was just wondering how long you would let Sally  make a slave  of you.\" In reality, no matter how  _  or how uncomfortable it is to admit our wrongdoing, we should always choose to  _  it and work it through instead of running away from it. Hard as it is, it  _  us and makes us who we are.",
