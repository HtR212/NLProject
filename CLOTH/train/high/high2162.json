I had bright red hair and enormous glasses. In addition, I was  _  and not very sociable. Boarding the school bus that first day, I felt like all eyes on me. I could hear the  _  \"She's huge!\" Obviously, the kids on the bus had known each other well. I spent that first bus  _  in silence.\nThe following day was even  _  . I did not notice that a few boys had tied a shoelace across the aisle  and thus fell face first on the bus,  _  everything I was carrying.  _  I was embarrassingly gathering my supplies, I could hear the laughter, and then the  _  \"That felt like an earthquake!\" Anyway, I  _  to find a seat.

I would also walk to a  _  about two miles down the road, where I would chat silently with God. I began  _  the afternoon school bus  on purpose  , walking home instead. Then,  _  , I started losing weight. And as I became  _  with myself, I began making friends.\nOne of my newly-found friends also  _  with her weight, wanting to be a \"perfect\" cheerleader. She lived near my neighborhood so we would meet and  _  together. This became a daily routine with talking and laughing  _  the way -- different from the lonely walks I had taken. My friend said that I didn't have to be  _  . I just had to be me, and be happy with myself.\nWhile I would not want to relive that time of loneliness, sadness and embarrassment, I am  _  I made it through. Whenever I am struggling with any other problem in life, I always remember the proverb \"This too shall pass.\" If you can find a path with no obstacles or challenges, it probably doesn't  _  anywhere.",
