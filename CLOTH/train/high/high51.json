It seemed like this would be a good\ntime to let my teenage daughter Holly practice her  _  ,\nso I sent her to the store in my truck.\n  At dinner my    _  talked about how much he liked my truck. I enjoyed having it, but I\nsaid: \"Guy, my heart is not set on that truck. I like it but it is just metal\nand  _  last forever.  _  set your\nheart on anything that won't last.\n  After hearing the loud noise, the whole family ran outside. My son shouted; \" Dad! Dad, Holly crashed your truck.\"\n  My heart    _  and my mind was flooded with  _  thoughts.\nWas anyone hurt? Who else was involved? As I ran to the door, I heard a voice\nin my heart say: \"Here is a chance to show Holly  _  you\nreally love. She'll never forget it.\"\n  The    _  had occurred in my own driveway. Holly had  _  my\ntruck into our family van  . In her   _  , she had confused the brakes and the\ngas pedal. Holly was unhurt  _  but when I reached her,\nshe was crying and saying \" Oh, Dad, I'm sorry. I know how much you love this\ntruck.\" I held her in my arms as she cried.\n  Later that week a friend asked what had   _  to my truck. I told her the whole\nstory. Her eyes moistened  and she said: \" That happened to me when I was a girl. I ruined my dad's car. When I got home , my dad knocked me    _  the\nground and began to kick me.\"\n  Over 40 years later, she still felt the   _  of the night. It was a  _  wound on her soul.\n  I remember how   _  Holly was the night she crashed our truck, and how I  _  her.\nOne day, when Holly  thinks back  on her life, I want her to know\nthat I love her a thousand times more than any piece of  _  .",
