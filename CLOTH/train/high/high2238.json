    "article": "It was October in 1982. A friend had business dealings in the city of Reno, Nevada. I was asked to  _  her on an overnight trip. While she conducted her  _  , I was  _  wandering down Virginia street. I headed into a most  _  sunset. I had an  _  to speak to someone on the street to share that beauty,  _  I couldn't make eye contact with anyone. It seemed everyone was walking along , looking at their feet. I took the next-best action. I  _  into a department store and asked the lady behind the counter if she could come  _  for just a minute. She looked at me  as though  I were from some other planet and said, \"well...\" When she got outside I said to her, \"Just look at that sunset! Nobody out here was looking at it and I just wanted to  _  it with someone.\" For a few seconds we just looked. Then I said, \"God's in his heaven and  _  is right with the world.\" I  _  her for coming out to see it; she went back inside and I left. It felt good to share the beauty. Four years later I had come to the  _  of a twenty-year marriage. I was alone and on my own for the first time in my life and lived in a trailer park  _  was mainly for the poor. One day I picked up a Unity Magazine and read an article about a woman who had been in  _  circumstances. She had come to the end of a marriage, moved to a  _  community, and the only job she could find was one she disliked: sales lady in a department store. We had a lot  in common  . Then something happened to her, which  _  everything. She said a woman ran into her department store and asked her to step outside to look at a  _  . The woman had said, \"God's in his heaven and all's right with the world.\" She had  _  the truth in that statement and she turned her life around from that moment on.",
