    "article": "When I was fifteen years old, I made my first visit to the United States. It wasn't the first time I had been  _  . Like most English children I learned  _  at school I had often been to France, so I  was used to  speaking a foreign language to people who didn't understand English.   _  when I went to America I was really looking forward to  _  a nice easy holiday without any  _  problems.\n  _  wrong I was! The misunderstanding began at the airport. I was looking for a  _  telephone to give my American friend Danny a  _  and tell her I had arrived. A friendly old man saw me looking lost and asked  _  he could help me. \"Yes\", I said, \"I want to give my friend a ring.\"\"Well, that's  _  ,\"he exclaimed. \"Are you getting  _  ? But aren't you a bit  _  ?\" \"Who is talking about marriage?\"I replied. \"I  _  want to give my friend a ring to tell her I've arrived. Can you tell me  _  there's a phone box?\"Oh!\"he said, \"There's a phone downstairs.\"\nWhen at last we  _  meet each other, Danny explained the misunderstanding to me. \"Don't worry,\"she said to me. \"I had so many  _  at first. There are lots of words which are Amercians  _  differently in meaning from us British. You'll soon get used to all the  _  thing they say. Most of the  _  British and American people understand each other!\"",
