In the last act, a jailor would come on the stage with a  _  which he would hand to the  _  . Even though the noble was expected to  _  the letter at each performance, he always insisted that it be  _  out in full.\nOne night, the jailor decided to play a  _  on his fellow-actor to find out  _  after so many performances, he had  _  to learn the contents of the letter by heart. The  _  went up on the final act of the play and revealed the noble sitting alone in his dark cell . Just then, the jailor appeared with the letter in his hands. He entered the   _  and handed the letter to the noble.  _  the copy he gave him was  _  a blank sheet of paper. The jailor looked on,  _  to see if his fellow-actor had learned his lines. The noble  stared at  the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds. Then he said,\"The light is dim . Read the letter to me.\" And he immediately handed the paper to the jailor.  _  that he could not  _  a word of the letter, the jailor replied,\"The light is  _  dim, sir. I must get my  _  \".  _  this, he hurried off the stage. Much to the noble's  _  , the jailor returned a few seconds later with a pair of glasses and the  _  copy of the letter which he started to read to the prisoner.",
