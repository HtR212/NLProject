    "article": "After a decade at the publishing company, I was fired. I had worked so hard for so long. I was always doing my job   _   , clawing my way up the ladder. And 42 so what  ? Doing these things had   _   me in the end, very little of lasting value. I wondered what would happen if I let it all go--didn't look for a job, didn't keep my   _   ambition. \nMy husband thought it was a great idea. \"Just   _   .\" he said. As a serious windsurfer, he suggested I try the sport as a path to clarity. I had windsurfed before , but only in   _   water. I didn't like high winds. I didn't like going fast--that was   _  . But I wanted to abandon the past. My   _   was to do nothing but read and windsurf every day. I wanted to feel the fear and do it anyway. I wanted to learn how to ride the currents, and I couldn't think of a better way than to   _   myself to the invisible, ever-shifting wind. \nI decided to sail at Swell City, a favorite outpost on the Washington side of the Columbia. That July   turned out   to be one of the windiest months on record. I grew to find that what I was doing did   _   for my standing in the world. It won me no friends.Then again, I was   _   . \nOne day, a friend and her l5-year-old son came, and after I explained my   _   , he said the simplest but most profound thing: \"It's all in the   _   . \" This kid had windsurfed only three times ,   _   he knew the secret. \"If you go out there knowing you're going to   _   it, you will, \"he continued. \"But if you go out there afraid you'll get hurt , you will. \" I smiled at him. Wasn't that   _   the same problem I'd encountered in life? I'd always been terrified l wouldn't reach the goal or   _   the job. I knew I had to let that fear go. And slowly I did. \nThe wind wanted nothing from me. It cared not at all about my ambition or accomplishments. It   _   me that the beauty of life is in the trying. And that's where I am: still trying for the turnaround in life and in the   _   .",
