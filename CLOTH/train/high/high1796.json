Polio was well known in Webster Groves, Missouri, having killed and   _   many children there.\nThe doctor felt duty-bound to inform George of the   _   truth. \"I hate to tell you this, son\" he said, \"but the polio is so bad that you will probably never   _   again without a limp , and your left arm will be useless.\"\nGeorge had always   _   himself as a championship wrestler in his senior year after just missing it as a junior.   _   able to speak, George whispered: \"Doctor...\"\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor   leaning over  the bed. \"What is it, my boy?\"\n\"Go to hell ,\" said George in a voice filled with   _  .\nThe doctor seemed shocked, but you see, Mom and Dad   _   us that just like you would never like someone else come into your house with an axe and break up your furniture, you should never let a   _   thought come into your mind and break up your dreams.\nThe next day, the nurse walked into George's room to find him lying flat on his   _   on the floor.\n\"What's going on in here?\" asked the   _   nurse.\n\"I'm walking.\" George   _   replied.\nSometimes it would take George 20 minutes just to get out of the chair, but he   _   any offers of help. I remember seeing him lift a tennis ball with as much   _   as a healthy man would need to lift a 100-pound barbell.\nI also remember seeing him, six months later, step out on the mat as captain of the   _   team. George's return from the horrible effects of polio was written about in   _   all over the state of Missouri. No one had ever been known to   _   so quickly or so completely from this disease. He had been through hell and he came out of it with a   _   as strong as steel.",
