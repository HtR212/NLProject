And scientists positively predict the new technology will   _   provide childcare and offer   _   to lonely elderly people.\nWith her soft skin and flowing dark-brown hair, Nadine does not only meet and greet  _  , smile, make eye contact and   _   hands, but she can even  _   past guests and get into conversation based on   _   chats.\nUnlike   _   robots, Nadine has her own personality and   _   . She can be happy or sad,   _   on the topic.\nPowered by intelligent   _   similar to Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana, she is the creation of scientists at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and is based on her creator Prof Nadia Thalmann.\nProf Thalmann, the director of the Institute for Media Innovation wholed the development said robots such as Nadine are bound to become more visible in offices and   _   in future.\n\"Robotics technologies have   _   significantly over the past few decades and are already being used in manufacturing and logistics,\" she said.\n\"As countries worldwide face   _   of an aging population,   _   robots can be one solution to   deal with   the shrinking  workforce, become personal   _   for children and the elderly at home, and   _   serve as a platform for healthcare services in future.\"\n\"Over the past four years, our team at NTU have been   _   cross-disciplinary  research in social robotics technologies-- involving engineering, computer science, linguistics, psychology and other  _   -- to transform a virtual human , from within a computer, into a   _   being that is able to observe and interact with other humans.\"",
