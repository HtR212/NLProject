The other  day I was sitting in a restaurant   having   a quick drink and a talk with a few friends when it suddenly   _   me that almost everyone in the restaurant was smoking. It wasn't long   _   the whole room was   _   with smoke. I asked with an apology for   _   to open a window to stop myself   _  !\nNowadays air pollution is something that hardly question any more. However, I still can't walk down the street in any of the big cities without   _   that people are   _   the air pollution. It is time for the government departments of the world to introduce emission  controls on all cars and   _   the public transport system  to encourage people to   _   their cars at home. A friend of mine takes flying lesson each morning and it really makes him   _   when he climbs above the smog layer  and looks down   _   it and thinks: \"I'm breathing that!\" This kind of   _   results from the bad management of resources. Waste things can   _   should, be treated properly. House building, road   _  , and industrial development are all earthmoving(or earth-reducing) operations and can change the balances of   .life   created over millions of years. I would like to   _  serious studies done on all these main works before they are built. Also, there should be   _   national parks set up to keep the most beautiful parts of our countries in their natural   _  .",
