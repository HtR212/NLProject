    "article": "At the edge of a forest, stood a big tree. Its branches spread out majestically   and so did its roots. It  _  people from the sun under its shady leaves, and provided  _  to countless birds and other small creatures in its branches. It was very excited with activity all the time.\nAt the foot of the tree grew a little plant. The plant was tall, thin, graceful and easily  _  , and tended to fall over at the  _  of the slightest wind.\nOne day, the two neighbours were having a little chat.\n\"Well, little one, \" said the tree to the plant, \" Why do you not plant your feet deeply in the ground, and raise your head  _  in the air as I do?\"\n\"I see no need to do so,\"  _  the plant with a smile. \"  _  , I think I may be safer this way.\"\n\"Safer!\" sneered   the tree. \" Are you  _  that you're safer than I am? Do you know how deep my roots are  _  ,  how thick and strong my trunk is?  Even if  two men hold hands they would not be able to surround my trunk. Who could possibly pull me out by the roots or  _  my head to the ground?\"\nAnd the tree turned away from the plant in  _  .\nBut the tree was to  _  its words very soon. One evening a great hurricane  _  in the region. It threw the trees off their roots and almost completely destroyed the forest. It uprooted the tree and  _  it away with great force.\nWhen the storm had passed, the villagers living nearby  _  the damage. Strong trees that had once almost touched the sky, were now reduced to stumps  or  _  . The dead animals were found everywhere in the  _  .\nBut there was one  _  . The little plant. The plant had been moved from side to side under the hurricane, and bent completely. But when the hurricane ended, it sighed and stood upright again.\nNo trace remained of its powerful neighbour  _  .",
