A young couple looking at the paintings ahead of me talked  _  between\nthemselves. I watched them a moment and  _  she was doing all the talking.\nI admired his patience for  _  up with the talkativeness. Annoyed by her noise, I moved on. \nI  _  with them several times as I moved through the different\nrooms of art.  Each time  I heard her continuous\ntalking, I moved  _  quickly. I was at the counter of\nthe gift shop when I  _  the couple going to the\nexit. Before they left, the man took out a walking stick and then tapped  his  way  into\nthe coatroom to get his wife's jacket.\n\"He's a(n)  _  man, \" the clerk at the counter said. \"Most of us would  give up  if we are blinded at such a\nyoung age. During his recovery, he said his wife wouldn't change. So, as\nbefore, he and his wife come in  _  there is a\nnew art show. \"\n\"But  _  does he get out of the art?\" I asked. \"He can't\nsee.\"\n\"Can't see! You're  _     .He sees a lot. More than you or I do.\"  The clerk\nsaid. \"His wife  _  each painting so he can see\nit in his  _  .\"\nI  _  something about patience, courage and love that\nday. I saw the  _  of a young wife describing\npaintings to a person without  _  and the courage\nof a husband who would not allow  _  to\nchange his life. And I saw the love  _  by two\npeople as I watched this couple walk away hand in hand.",
