The city d'amour  , where loved ones walk by the River Seine, kiss under the Eiffel Tower, and enjoy   _   candle-lit dinners at the famous Le Meurice restaurant. Across the city, \"love locks\",  _   of a couple's love are put on its famous bridges to stay there forever. But in the city of love, all is not as it seems.\nInstead of romantic streets, there are dirty ones; instead of world-class service, there are   _   waiters; and instead of carefully watched attractions, there are pickpockets.\nThese are some of the  _  of tourists visiting the French capital who have been shocked after40 _ a kind of Paris very different from the one seen in the popular films Chocolat and Amelie.\nThe \"Paris syndrome  \", as it is known, describes the feeling of disenchantment   after building up a romantic view of the city.\nAs there are expensive Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Cartier stores on the famous Champs-Elysees, it is easy to see why 60 percent of Chinese tourists41 _ in Paris. But because they are often carrying large amounts of money, many Chinese tourists are being  _  by the city's pickpockets.\n\"Sometimes, Chinese tourists try to  pay for  an ice cream with a 500-euro (3,867-yuan) bill,\" Jean-Francois Zhou, president of the Chinese association of travel agencies in France, told Bloomberg. \"They usually change large amounts of yuan to  _  money-changing fees, and the use of credit cards isn't as45 _ in China as it is in Europe,\" he  _      .\nHowever, stories of rude Parisians have long been told   throughout   Europe. The British have been teasing the French for being unfriendly for a long time, and even many French people outside of Paris admit that Parisians can be a little bad-tempered. But dig deeper than the general nice tourist interactions and you'll find a  _  side to Paris and Parisians. If you're willing to go to places that you might not see in postcards, there are many incredibly   beautiful and surprising  _  hidden all around the city that will give you a taste of the romance you  _  . Paris is simply a proud city that sometimes gets a little tired of tourists.",
