I knew my parents weren't very happy, and they   _   fought, but I still expected my family to   _   the same.\n    After the divorce my life completely changed. My friends didn't know my   _    and wondered why I was now so   _   all the time, completely   _   from the active girl they were familiar with. After Dan and my mother married, I realized that there was no   _   that things could change back.\n    My salvation  came from the   _    person on earth that I would have expected -- Dan, my new stepfather. He never   gave up   on me although I wasn't very nice to him. Gradually, I began to   _   him. I realized that we actually had some   _   interest, especially when it 32 came to  movies and TV shows. We spent a lot of time together watching TV.

Their break-up was the best thing to happen for all of us. My father also found 39 _  in his life.\n    At thirteen, I learned an important truth -- change is not always the worst thing that can happen. Sometimes, this kind of change is just what we   _   most.",
