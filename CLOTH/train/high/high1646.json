One day, in school his   _   told him to create and write about what he wished to be when he grew up. He didn't   _   one minute and wrote a seven-page paper about his trying to be a manager of a horse ranch with a plan in   _  .\nSoon after, he   _   his paper back with an \"F\". After class he came to the instructor and asked, \"Why did I   _   an F?\" The instructor responded, \"These dreams are too   _   for a boy, who does not have any money, no information and who comes from a very   _   family. There is absolutely no   _   that you'll achieve your great goals when you grow up.\" Then the teacher told Monty to   _   the paper with an realistic attitude.\nThe boy went home and asked his daddy what he should do. His dad   _  , \"This decision is important for you, which means you have to   _   your own decision.\"\nAfter several days and nights the boy   _   exactly the same paper to his teacher. No   _   were made. He said, \"Keep your   _   and I am going to keep my dream.\"\nNow Monty Roberts   _   a 4,000-square-foot house in the center of a 200-acre horse ranch and even now he has that school   _   framed(......) on the fireplace.\nRemember don't ever let someone tell you you can't do   _  . Not even your teachers. You got a   _  ; you got to protect it. People can't do something themselves so they want to tell you you can't do it. If you want something, go to   _   it.",
