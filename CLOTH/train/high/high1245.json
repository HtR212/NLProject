His face was lopsided   from swelling , red and raw. Yet his   _  was pleasant as he said: \"Good evening. I've come to ask to stay here for   _  one night. I came for treatment this morning from the eastern shore.\"\nHe told me he'd been hunting for a   _   since noon but no one would take him in. \"I guess it's my face...\"\nFor a moment I   _  , but his next words convinced me: \"I'll sleep in this rocking chair on the porch  . My bus leaves early in the morning.\"\nI told him that we would find him a bed inside. When we were   _   for supper, I asked if he would join us. \"No, thank you. I have plenty,\" he said,48 holding up a brown paper bag.\nWhen I had finished the dishes, I went out on the   _  .The old man told me his story - about 50 _ he fished to support his family. It didn't 51 _  me very long to realize that he had a big heart. We let him sleep in a folded bed in the children's room. When I got up in the morning, the sheets were neatly   _  and the little man was outside again.\nHe refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, he asked: \"   _  I stay here again the next time I receive treatment? I can sleep fine in a chair.\" He paused a moment and then54: _  \"You made me feel at home.\" I told him he was 55 _  anytime.\nThe next time, he arrived a little after seven in the morning. He56 _  us a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had caught them early that morning57 _ he left so that they'd be fresh.\nI often thought of a58 _ our next-door neighbor made after the man left the first time.\"Did you keep that man last night? You'll lose customers by 59 putting up such people!\"\nMaybe we did60 _ a few. But who wants customers like that - ones who would prejudge   a wonderful person based on appearance?",
