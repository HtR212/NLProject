Fill in each blank with the word or phrase that best fits the context. When I was 8 years old, I once decided to run away from home. With my suitcase  _  and some sandwiches in a bag, I started for the front door and said to Mom, \"I'm leaving.\" \"If you want to  run away  , that's all right,\" she said. \"But you came into this home without anything and you can leave the same way.\" I  _  my suitcase and sandwiches on the floor heavily and started for the door again. \"Wait a minute,\" Mom said. \"I want your  _  back. You didn't wear anything when you arrived.\" This really angered me. I tore my clothes off--shoes, socks, underwear and all--and  _  , \"Can I go now?\" \"Yes,\" Mom answered, \"but once you close that door, don't expect to come back.\" I was so  _  that I slammed the door and stepped out on the front porch.  _  I realized that I was outside, with nothing on. Then I noticed that down the street, two neighbor girls were walking toward our house. I ran to  _  behind a big tree in our yard at once. After a while, I was  _  the girls had passed by.

He ran away from home.\" Glancing behind me to see if anyone else was coming, I begged, \"Aw, c'mon, Mom! I'm  _  your son. Let me in!\" The door inched open and Mom's smiling face appeared. \"Did you change your  _  about running away?\" she asked. \"What's for supper?\" I answered. (277 words)",
