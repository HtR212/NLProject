There are  on the market all kinds of vitamins which we can take to  make up for  our lack of certain important things which are needed for good health.  Of course  if we eat well and properly, the food that we eat will  take care of  our bodies and so there is no  _  to take any kind of vitamins  _  our doctors tell us that our bodies are  _  of something which can be supplied by it. Generally speaking, everything we eat  _  some good to our bodies, but if we eat  too much  of one kind of food and pay  too little  attention to others, we may have too much of one kind and not  enough  of others. Then we may be  in  trouble. We are often told  _  we must eat some meat every day in order to get the necessary proteins. That is only  _  true, for proteins are not found only in meat. We can also get them  _  some vegetables. The best advice about  _  to eat is that we should eat all kinds of food  _  never too much of one kind.",
