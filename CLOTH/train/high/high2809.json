    "article": "A man was exploring some caves by the seashore. In one cave he   _  a bag of hardened clay\nballs. It seemed that someone had  _  some clay and\nbaked the balls in the sun. They didn't look like  _  things,\nbut they interested him,  _  he took the bag out of the\ncave with him.\nAs he walked along the beach he   _  the clay balls one at a time out into the ocean as far as he could.\nHe thought  _  about it until he dropped one of\nthe balls and it cracked open on a rock.  _  was a beautiful,\nprecious stone.  _  , the man started breaking open the remaining clay\nballs.  Each  contained a similar treasure. He found thousands of\ndollars' worth of jewels in the 20 or so clay balls he had  _  , and\nthen it struck him:  instead of  thousands of dollars in treasure, he\ncould have had tens of thousands, with the 50 or 60 clay balls with their  _  treasures which were now in the ocean. He just  _  the chance.\nSometimes it's like that with   _  . When we look at a person, we usually only see \"the outside clay shell\".\nIt isn't always beautiful or shining, so we  _  the\nperson; we see him as less important than someone more beautiful or more  _  . But we haven't taken the time to look for the  _  inside\nthat person. If we spend the time getting to know that person, the clay will  come off  and the brilliant jewel will shine. We are  _  made,\nnot only with our physical bodies, but also with our spiritual selves, which\nare sometimes hidden  _  others by the \"earthen shell\".",
