With so much   _  available\non what's healthy and what isn't, it's easy to get  confused about  what\nyou should and what you shouldn't be eating.\nYou've gotten into the habit of   _  food labels. You check the dairy items,\nbiscuits and microwave meals for  _  like \"low\nfat\", \"reduced fat\" or \"no fat\" and you  _  your\nshopping bag with them.  _  it right there. Just\nhaving a \"fat free\" label doesn't make it any healthier -- in fact it's probably\nmuch  _  for you.\nNuts are healthy but they aren't all created   _  . If you're eatingalmonds  or brazil nuts -- well done, they are good for you. Peanuts on the other hand are not your   _  . They probably have the least nutritional  _  from\nthe entire nut family. If you do  _  them, try to\nreduce the quantity.\nFruit juice is another dangerous one. Most fruit juice contains too much   _  . Check the\ningredients section on the bottle. If sugar is at the top of the list, it's a\nbad sign. Ingredients are  _  from highest\nquantity to least. Put the juice back on the  _  if\nsugar is in the top five ingredients. Try to make your own at home with a juice\nmaker and fresh fruit -- you can even  _  vegetables\nfor more nutritional value.\nDried fruit is   _  classed as \"healthy food\". It is and it isn't. A handful of dried\nfruit is much better than a bar of chocolate.  _  too\nmuch dried fruit on a daily basis is only going to increase your sugar intake.\nWhatever you   _  to consume, make sure you do it inmoderation . Stick to a   _  diet\nand you'll stay healthy.",
