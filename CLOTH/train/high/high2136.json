    "article": "One evening, long after most people had gone to bed, a friend of mine and I  went  happily home through the  _  street. We had been to a music-hall and  were talking  about the people we had seen and heard in it. \"The show  _  him a star overnight, \" said my friend about one of them. \"He was completely  _  before. And now thousands of people  _  him gifts and letters. \" \"I thought him quite good, \" I said , \" but not  _  thousands of letters . As a matter of  fact  , one of his songs gave me a shock. It was too noisy. \" \"What was that?\" my friend asked me, \"  _  it to me .\" I began to sing. \"Do be quiet. You will give everybody a shock and  _  them up for miles  _  , besides, there will be a policeman  in front of  us. \" My friend gave me a surprised look. \"Never mind. I don't care. What is the matter?\" I said and went on singing  _  the top of my voice . Suddenly there came a policeman,  _  in front of me , his notebook  _  . \"  Excuse me  , sir ,\" he said , \"You have a very good voice , if I  _  say so . Who taught you singing? I'd very much  _  to find someone who can give my daughter singing lessons. Would you be  kind enough  to tell me your name and address? Then my wife and I would  visit  you and we could discuss it .\"",
