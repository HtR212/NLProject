    "article": "\"Scotty!\" Mr. Brown, my Year 11 English teacher, called me by my nickname   across the classroom. His eyes were bright and a secret  _  was half hidden behind the beard.\nOnce he finished joking over my unbearable  _  , I realized he was going to read my story aloud to the class. I turned red, feeling at once both embarrassed and  _  . I had my very  _  reading audience! Though my classmates were a 'passive audience', it didn't weaken my feeling of being  _  .\nAfter that, I came to  _  those Year 11 English classes. Throughout school I had always studied hard and achieved well in my school subjects. But creative  _  was a passion, and it was not an assignment, but a way of understanding the world and of  _  my thoughts and feelings about events and attitudes.\nMr. Brown was the first to  _  me for my writing so openly. My scores were always 19/20 or 20/20. My stories were often read out to the class. He even  _  one with the respected Head of English teachers, which was the most  _  part that is impressed on my memory. But  more than  that, he offered a belief in me that no other teacher had.\nMy school  _  often stated, 'Candice is a quiet achiever.' I thought it was meant as a(n)  _  for being hard-working. I was someone that no one really  _  before, but Mr. Brown managed to  _  all that by bringing me to the attention of the world. Though it was the relatively  _  world of school, it put the seed of belief in myself that some day I could be an  _  person rather than the person who faded into the background.\nI  _  touch with my teacher long ago, as we do when we move away from the school system and enter life. I wish I could tell him now how much he  _  me.",
