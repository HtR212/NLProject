He would always  _  all of his extern) time with the little boy. One night. while the man was at work, he  _  that he had extra work to do for the evening, and that he wouldn't be able to play with his little boy.  _  he wanted to be able to give the boy something to keep him  _  . So, looking around his office, he saw a magazine with a large  _  of the world on the cover. He got a(n)  _  . He removed the map, and then patiently tore it up into small pieces. Then he put all the  _  in his coat pocket. When he got home, the little boy came  _  to him and was ready to play. The man  _  that he had extra work to do and couldn't play just now. He  _  the little boy into the dinning room, and  took out  all the pieces of the map. He spread them on the table. He explained that it was a map of the world, and that by the time he could  put it back  together, his extra work would be  _  , and they could both play.

Can we play now?\" The man was  _  , saying, \"That's impossible. Let's have a look.\" And  _  enough, there was the picture of the world, all put together, every piece in its  _  . The man said, \"That's amazing! How did you do that?\" The boy said, \"It's  _  . On the  _  of the page is a(n)  _  of a man. When I put the man together the whole world fell into place.\"",
