The common expression, \"athletics are 90 percent  _  and 10 percent physical,\" is often used by coaches, and stresses that mindsets make a huge  _  in competitions. \"The physical aspect of the sport can only take you  so far  ,\" said Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Shannon Miller during an interview with the Dana Foundation. \"The mental aspect has to  turn on  , especially when you're talking about the best of the best. In the Olympic games, everyone is talented. Everyone  _  hard. Everyone does the work. What  _  the gold medalists from the silver medalists is simply the mental game.\" Many athletes have used the technique of mental imagery, or  _  , to perform at their best. Research on the brain patterns of  _  found that the patterns activated when a weightlifter lifted heavy weights were activated  _  when they simply imagined lifting and some studies have suggested that mental  _  can be almost as effective as physical training. One study, published in the Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology in 1996, found that  _  weight lifting caused  _  changes in muscle activity. \"Mental imagery  _  many cognitive processes in the brain: motor control, attention, perception, planning, and memory,\" researcher Angie LeVan wrote in Psychology Today. \"So the  _  is getting trained for actual performance during visualization. It's been found that mental practices can enhance motivation, increase confidence, improve motor performance and  _  your brain for success.\"  _  visualizing is more than just thinking about an upcoming event.  _  athletes use visualization, they truly feel the event taking place in their mind's eye. \"During visualization, she incorporates all of her  _  into the experience,\" sports psychologist Dr JoAnn Dahlkoetter wrote in a blog post on The Huffington Post  _  a speed skater she works with. \"She feels her forefoot pushing off the track, she hears her skating splits, and she sees herself racing ahead of the competitors. She experiences all of the elements of her race  in detail  before executing her performance.\"",
