David stood up and said people with wrinkles could be called old people, However, Mary didn't  _  , for some people may gain wrinkles at an earlier age owing to their  _  work. Then Lily expressed her idea that those reaching their 60s or more could be called old people. This time, Emily expressed her  _  that some old people may still be energetic and trying to pursue their dreams, which makes them appear  _  . The class was over and we still didn't reach any  _  , so the teacher asked us to think about it after class.\nThe  _  has reminded me of the saying of J. Barrymore that a man isn't old as long as he is   _  something.\nMy grandma is such a woman who pursues her dream  _  when she's 70 now. She has  _  her dream of being a painter since she was a little child.  _  , because her family was poor, she had to  put aside  her dream and stepped into the  _  to raise money so as to support her family. Though she has  _  abandoned her dream, she could hardly find any  _  to realize it because of the tough work.  _  , chance came when she retired from her work. She began taking her painting lessons  _  she had all-white hair and lots of wrinkles. At first, I was  _  her idea of attending school at so old an age, but after seeing her paint happily and enjoyably, I  _  feeling it a good choice. She seems energetic and  _  fine.\nSo if we have our dreams and seek for them, we aren't old. It's when we don't know what we want and let  _  be the center point of our lives that we can finally be regarded as the old.",
