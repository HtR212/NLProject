    "article": "According to Greek legend, in ancient Athens a man noticed the great storyteller Aesop playing childish games with some little boys. He  _  and made fun of\nAesop, asking him why he wasted his time in such  _  games.\nAesop responded by   picking up  a bow, loosening its string, and placing it on the ground. Then he said to\nthe critical man, \"Now,  _  the riddle , if you can. Tell us what the unstrung bow means.\"\nThe man   _  at it for several minutes but had no idea\nabout what  _  Aesop was trying to\nmake. Aesop  _  ,\"If you keep a bow always bent, it will\nbreak  _  ; but if you let it go loose, it will be more  _  for use when you want it.\"\nSo it is with us. Our minds and bodies are like the   _  .When often under the  _  of everyday life, we can finally  _  .We need to\nloosen up; we need time to  _  the pressure off and relax.\nFormer baseball pitcher  Dutch Leonard might have put it a little differently. He once said that the  _  of great pitching is not speed or the ability to throw curves . It's the \"change of pace\". Even the  _  batter  will soon learn how to hit a pitcher who continually throws the same kind of pitch. But it's   _  to hit a pitcher who changes\nthe pace of pitching. That  _  of pace gives a\npitcher an advantage over the other pitchers.\nA change of pace also gives us a(n)   _  in life. Taking time to\nwatch the clouds, enjoy a breeze, take a walk, read just slowdown is  _  if we are to be our best later. And a regular day of rest is as\nimportant as regular sleep. It's a  _  of taking\nthe pressure off.\nTo be your best, make sure you change your pace. It may just be the change you need.",
