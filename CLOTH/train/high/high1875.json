    "article": "My grandmother became a widow in 1970. Shortly after that, we went to the  _  shelter to pick out a dog to keep her  _  . Grandma decided on a little dog with a reddish-brown spot above each eye.  Because of  these spots, the dog was named Penny. Grandma and Penny quickly became very  _  to each other, but that attachment grew much stronger about three years later  _  Grandma had a stroke . Grandma could no longer  _  , so when she came home from the hospital, she and Penny were  _  companions. After her stroke, it became a real  _  for Grandma to let Penny in and out because  the door  was at the bottom of a flight of stairs. So a mechanism using a rope and pulley was  _  from the door to a handle at the top of the stairs. Grandma just had to pull the handle to open and close the door. If the store was  out of  Penny's favorite dog food, Grandma would make one of us  _  Penny browned beef with potatoes in it. I can remember  making fun of  my grandmother by saying that she loved that dog better than she loved her family. As the years passed, it was not  _  for Grandma and Penny to separate each other. If Grandma went to take her nap , Penny stayed by her side until she  _  . As Penny aged, she could no longer jump up on the bed, so she  _  on the rug beside the bed. If Grandma went into the  bathroom  , Penny would walk along beside her, wait outside the door and accompany her  _  to the bed or chair. Grandma never went anywhere without her  _  companion by her side. The time came when both my grandmother's and Penny's  _  were failing fast. After fifteen years of loving companionship, Grandma and Penny passed away within a few hours of each other.",
