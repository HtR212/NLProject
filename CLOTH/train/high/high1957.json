    "article": "My wife and I were walking through the parking lot at the supermarket the other day. We noticed a huge truck   _   about a foot into the next parking space. There was plenty of room in its own space,   _   the driver had chosen to park very poorly and made sure that   _   could use the space next to his.\nMy first   _   was \"Why do people act like such idiots  ?\"\n\"What a   _   that people have to do things like that.\" My wife said.\nI stopped and looked around at the rest of the parking lot. There were a good five hundred   _   and 99% of them were parked well. Their drivers had shown the   _   necessary to park in a way that still   _   other people to park.\n\"Think about it,\" I said. \"Only one   _   parks poorly and we start using 'people' to describe the driver.\" The   _   of the matter is that we forget about the thousands of people who behave themselves when we see one person doing something   _  .\nI've been   _   for many years, and the percentage of good drivers is always   _   than the percentage of poor drivers. \"People\" don't necessarily drive poorly, but individuals do.\nMy wife and I almost didn't   _   the many cars that were parked well because the car that was parked poorly caught our   _  . It is true that we're far less   _   to see the positive side of things if we keep   _   on the negative. Once we fall into this trap, how many of the wonderful things in the world will we   _  ?\nOur lives are ours to live, and the   _   we see our world is up to us. Remember: the rude person truly is a(n)   _  , and not really worth the time or effort we spend thinking about him or her.",
