    "article": "I ran across an old photo of him the other day, thinking of some old things. He's been dead for 25 years. His name was Rex.\n1  _   was his favorite recreation . He had so much 2  _   in the water as any person I have known. You didn't have to throw a stick in the water to 3  _   him to go in. Of course, he would bring back a stick to you if you 4   _   throw one in.\nThat 5   _   me of that night, 6  _   he brought back a small box that he found somewhere--- how 7  _   nobody ever knew. Since it was Rex, it 8  _   easily have been half  a race. The box wasn't a god one. It was just a 9  _   old piece that somebody 10  _  . Still it was something he wanted, probably 11  because   there was some difficulty in transportation . And that he thought could test his courage. We first knew about his achievement when, deep in the night, we 12   _   him trying to get the box up onto the porch . It sounded 13  as if   two or three people were trying to tear the house 14   _  . We came downstairs and turned on the 15  _   light. Rex was on the top step trying to pull the thing up, but it had 16  _  somehow. And he was just holding his own . I suppose he would have held his own 17  _   dawn if we hadn't helped him. The next day we carried the box miles away and threw it out. If we had thrown it out in a 18  _   place, he would have brought it home again, as a small token of his strength in such matters. 19  After all  , he had been taught to carry heavy wooden objects about and he was 20  _   of his skill.",
