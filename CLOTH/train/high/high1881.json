I always  _  to meet a client first in the\nmorning and I usually have several visits to  _  in a day.\n   One cold February morning I was due to  _  a store at 9 am. I parked my car,\nwrapped my scarf around me and  _  up the street towards the\nshop front.\n   The small lane where the store was   _  was partially blocked by two\nworkmen who were busy  _  the broken pavement. I braced myself for the\nexpected catcalls . I was up early, out in the cold, and was laughed at by two men I didn't even   _  .\n   Then I stopped and remembered my own father. Both he and my grandfather had     _  much of their early careers working outside in  _  jobs before they became engineers. I remembered how hard Dad worked, in all\nkinds of  _  ; how he'd come home with sunburn or frostbite . I   _  that if I was cold, then these two guys were probably freezing,\ngiven that it looked  as though  they'd already been working for hours.\n   My customer's shop wasn't   _  but I wasn't annoyed at his lateness. I\nwent to a coffee shop around the corner,  _  myself a hot chocolate,\nand then I bought two more, with cream.\n   I made my way down the lane   _  the workmen. One of them turned to with a\nwide smile and  _  with a joke, \"Oh love, you shouldn't have!\" To his  _  ,\nI passed him the plate with the two steaming hot chocolates. I  _  , \"Maybe\nnot. But it's too cold to be working outside today.\"\n   I got two looks of genuine    _  from the two strangers, and a\ntimely reminder that it is as easy to be kind as it is to prejudge , but the former is \nso much more   _  .\nFrom this experience, I received something different: a smile, a feeling of\nhappiness, a sense of friendship with strangers, and the confidence to give\nmore.",
