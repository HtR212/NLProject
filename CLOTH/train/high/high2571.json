    "article": "My brother and I slipped out of the bed. We grabbed our   _   and put on our shoes. Without heaters in our old home, wearing coats inside was as   _   as wearing shirts in summer.\nBut this morning was   _  ; it was Christmas. No Christmas tree, no   _   in our home. But following   _  , we were promised to find one present on the top of the shoes. Some years, we would find   _   but new underwear, and other years we would find new socks. The gift itself wasn't our   _  , but the brand-new feeling made us scream with   _  .\nAnd then one special Christmas, I lifted the package   _   on shoes. I tore it, holding my breath and I found there was a doll with large brown eyes   staring at   me. I grabbed it from the box and held   the doll   against my chest.   Even though   it smelled of plastic, it sent a wave of pleasure through me.\nThose days flickered with  memories of the   _   and easy life. It was a life   lacking in   material possessions,   _   one rich with appreciation for small thing. Later as I   grew up   in America, life changed. We lived a rich life and life became easier. Gifts   _   more and their purchase became urgent.   _  , our wants turned into boring needs. Sadly, what we   _   as children was now painted in a sorrowful scene. Although weather changes and seasons offer variety, we can   _   change by taking a step back to the simpler life.",
