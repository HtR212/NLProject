    "article": "Some years ago I worked with people on public welfare. I believed that everybody had the ability to be  _  and all we have to do was to make them start working.\nThe first thing I said to them was, \"I would like to know what your  _  are.\" Everyone looked at me as if I were  _  . One woman said \"I don't know what you can  _  with dreams. The rats are eating up my kids.\" I said. \"That's terrible. You are very much  _  with the rats and your kids. How can we help?\" \" I could use a new screen door because there are  _  in the old.\"  I asked, \"Is there anybody knowing  _  to fix it?\" A man said, \"Long ago I used to do things like that but now I have a bad back, but I'll  _  .\" I gave him some money to do that.\nThe next week, when the group was  _  , I asked the woman, \"Well, is your  _  door fixed?\" \"Oh, yes,\" she said. \"Then we can start dreaming, right?\" She  _  at me. I asked the man, \"How do you feel?\" He said, \"Well, it's funny that I'm beginning to feel a lot  _  .\" These seemingly small  _  allowed the group to see that dreams were not stupid. One woman  _  that she wanted to be a secretary. I said, \" What  _  in your way?\" She answered, \"I have six kids, and no one can  look after  them while I'm away.\" I asked \"Who would help this woman while she gets some  _  at school?\" Another woman said \"I got kids, too, but I could do that.\" So the woman went to school.\nIn 12 weeks these people were  _  public welfare. The woman who  took in  the children became a licensed foster care  person. The man became a handyman. I've not only done that  _  , I've done it many times.",
