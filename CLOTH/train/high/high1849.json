If this cross could talk, it would tell you this  _  story: Seven years ago my brother, Michael, was at a friend's farm. They decided to go out for dinner. Joe arrived and  _  to drive--after just one  _  .  _  , the four friends traveled the winding road. They didn't know where it would end ----  _  did. Suddenly, they turned  _  into the opposite lane , running into an oncoming car.  _  home we were watching E.T. on video in front of a warm fire. Then we went to bed. At 2:00 am a police officer  _  my mom with the shocking  _  . Michael had been killed. In the morning, I  _  my mother and sister crying. I stood there  _  . \"What's wrong?\" I asked, rubbing my  _  eyes. Mom took a deep breath. \"Come here...\" Thus began a difficult  _  through grief, where all roads lead to nowhere. It  _  hurts to remember that day. The only thing tat helps is telling my story,  _  you will remember it  _  you want to get into a car with someone who has had a drink ---- even just one drink. Joe chose the road to  _  . He was convicted of manslaughter and served time. However, the real punishment is  living with  the consequences of his actions. He left us  _  and ache in our hearts that will never go away, a nightmare that will  _  him--- and us ---- or the rest of our lives. And a small cross by the side of Highway 128.",
