    "article": "There's always been a debate on whether human beings are born good or bad.Depending on how you view the world,you can think of all the crimes and injustice and conclude that we're bad,so we need a system of laws to keep us in check.However,there are also a lot of stories of good deeds.I think we're all born good. Today,I took a trip to South Bend to attend my friends' wedding reception.I had  _  the night before at the forecast and it said we were going to get about 3 inches of snow,so I thought,\"That's not so  _  \"I set out on my journey and it was completely clear until I  _  to get towards Niles,M1... I was  _  with this ominous cloud,I thought to myself,\"Hmm,this can't be a good  _  .\" Soon enough,the highway became a snowpacked wall of white.I should have remembered that such severe changes in  _  are common in this part of America.I then tried to get to the populous area of South Bend and got  _  in the snow,  _  to turn left onto a street,I  _  for 20 minutes to dig myself out with only a scraper . It wasn't a very  _  street,so I didn't see many people.Just as I was starting to give up,a few people stopped by my car and then helped push me out of the snow bank.It was one person at first,and then a few others. Then,on the way to my destination,another lady got stuck.  _  ,I got out and was  _  to offer the same help that I had received.At least five others joined me in my  _  to get her car unstuck.It is kind of storm that makes roads undrivable.South Bend  _  up getting over 3 feet of snow. In these  _  of kindness though,I was once again  _  of my belief that all people are born good.These people didn't have to stop and help me out.They ran the  _  of having their own cars stuck.Even for myself,it was a(an)  _  reaction to get out and push the lady's car out too.I didn't think about it  _  a second. I believe these situations really helped remind me that this world is a good place.Real life situations can  _  good deeds.It happened today,and it will happen again and again.",
