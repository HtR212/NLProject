Larry was   _  along 165 north after delivering to one of his   _  . suddenly, he saw a car with its bright lights on.43 _ he got closer, he found 44 _ vehicle upside down on the road. One more look and he noticed   _   shooting out from under the   _   vehicle. Larry pulled over, set the brake and   got hold of  the fire extinguisher  . Two good bursts from the extinguisher and the fire was put out.\nThe man who had his bright lights on   came over   and told Larry he had   _   an emergency call. They   _   heard a woman's voice coming from the wrecked   vehicle.51 _   the vehicle, they saw that a woman was trying to get out of the broken window. They told her to stay   _   until the emergency personnel arrived,   _   she thought the car was going to   explode  . Larry told her that he had already put out the fire and she should not move   in case  she injured her neck.\nOnce fire and emergency people arrive, Larry and the other man   backed off   and let them go to work. Then, Larry asked the   _   if he was needed or   _  to go. They let him and the other man go.\nOne thing is   for certain   --Larry went above and beyond the call of duty by getting so close to the burning vehicle! His   _   most likely saved the woman's life.",
