So they  turned to  Socrates for advice on where happiness  _  . But  instead of  giving any answers, Socrates asked them to help with building a  _  first. The group of guys had to  set about  the task, laying aside their own business of seeking happiness. It took them a long time to cut down a tall tree, gouging out the center. Through painstaking effort, they made a canoe out of the tree. They launched the canoe into a river, and then  _  together in it, singing with  _  . Socrates asked, \"My children, do you have happiness now?\" They answered in chorus: \"We  _  be happier!\" Socrates  _  , \"That's it!  _  you are too busy pursuing something to notice anything bitter, happiness will occur.\" From the story I got to know that happiness  _  hides behind every tiny thing that you are involved in, and that you may only get pleasure through  _  work and creativity. We may have to  _  pain in our daily life and in the process of  _  happiness. Sometimes we tend to look for happiness in  _  things, like a new car, clothes, etc. True long term happiness, however, comes from within our  _  and spirit. So why not turn suffering into  _  life, and  _  tears into the light in your heart? Only in this way can we make it through and find true happiness.
