People tried to  _  coming into his house as they didn't want to come to such a  _  place. And the poor man thought that poverty   was the   _   for his unlucky life.\nThen, the poor man   _   a wise man and told him about his poverty. The man felt sorry for the poor man and gave him a vase. \"This will save you from  _  ,\" the wise man   _  . The poor man took the  _   from the wise man and wanted to   _   it at first and then spend the money on drinking, as usual. Besides, why would he  _  such a beautiful thing? But then he started  looking at  the vase carefully and decided not to take it to the market. He brought the vase back to his  _  , put it on the table and started watching it again.\n\"It's not   _  for such a beautiful thing to be  _  ,\" the poor man thought. So he   _  some flowers and put them into the vase. It became even   more beautiful  . \"Not good that such a beautiful thing stands next to a spider web,\" the poor man  _  again.\nSo the poor man started   _  his house. He cleaned the dust, washed the floor and whitened the walls. And it became clear that his house wasn't poor,  _   rather warm and comfortable. And the poor man wasn't a poor man anymore, but a hard-working host, who had no time to think about poverty.",
