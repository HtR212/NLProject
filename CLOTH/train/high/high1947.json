They've been making Christmas dreams come true for more than 20 years, but they never   _   they would receive a letter from a person who was already dead.\nLast week, the hosts of the station invited listener David Schmitz to their   _  , but the station didn't tell him who had sent in the   _   for his family. They read the letter to him on the   _  :\"Hello, my name is Brenda Schmitz. When you receive this letter, I will have already   _   my battle to cancer.\"\nThe big   _   made David's eyes swim in tears.\nDavid heard three wishes from his   _   wife. The first was to his new partner.\"Thank you, I love you whoever you are.\" And the second: \"For my family, a wonderful  _  , with many scenic spots where they all can enjoy their companionship as a new   _   and make memories that will be with them forever.\"   _  , she wanted to give a night of food and fun to the hospital   _   that cared for her during her   _   days.\nThe letter was written by Brenda two months before   passing away  . She prepared it and asked a friend to send it to the station once her husband fell in love   _  .\n\"I began to know Jayne, my present wife,   by chance  . On a cold afternoon, I took my little son, Marx, to the   _   where a group of seagulls were flying over his head. I didn't   _   it until Marx burst into tears, running to Jayne and asking her to be his   _  , who was playing there with her two children. Later, she became Marx's new mom and she   _   him as her own son. Brenda will live in our hearts forever.\"",
