You know how kids constantly ask questions? They have so much to learn and simply   _  information. Asking questions25 _ they are curious.\nSo  _  does that natural  _  become weak? Not at kindergarten, nor at primary school. But perhaps self-consciousness and a reluctance to draw attention to yourself by asking the teacher questions  _  with adolescence  .  If so  , that's a pity, because asking your teachers questions should be encouraged. After all, they've been educated,30 possess a lot more experience than you and perhaps have a little wisdom.\nWhen I taught journalism at college in Scotland, I  _  answering students' questions. Some of them asked difficult ones. I didn't always know the answers. If I didn't, I'd admit  _  and try to find out later. At university we were encouraged to challenge our peers and tutors. A student would prepare a paper on a subject and other students would  _  it. It was a way of  _  critical and logical thinking.\nYou can learn to think logically,  although  some of the more difficult problems would probably require advanced math. Having a logical mind can help develop critical thinking. My wife doesn't have a logical mind, but she does have emotional intelligence. An ability to empathize with people, relate to them and  _  their personalities is also important to critical thinking. I can't claim to have  _  like her emotional intelligence, but I'd like to think some of it has influenced me. If you can't  at least  try to put yourself in someone else's  _  , how can you understand their situation and their problems?\nSo try to develop your powers of critical thinking.  Start with  books, films, music and newspapers. And don't believe everything you read or see. Think for yourself.",
