    "article": "Last Sunday, I sat with Tony, my college classmate, in a well-known coffee shop in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As we  _  our coffee, two men entered and sat on an empty table beside us. They  _  the waiter and ordered three cups of  _  , two on the table and one on the wall. We heard this order with great  _  and observed that they were served with two cups of coffee  _  they paid for three. As soon as they  _  , the waiter pasted a piece of paper on the wall saying A Cup of Coffee. It  _  that the situation was normal at this place. However, it was something  _  for Tony and me. Since we had nothing to do with the situation, we  _  our coffee, paid the bill and left. After a few days, we again had a  _  to go to this coffee shop. While we were enjoying our coffee, a man entered. The way this man was dressed did not  _  the standard nor the atmosphere of this coffee shop. Poverty was  _  from the looks on his face. As he  _  himself, he looked at the  _  and said, \"One cup of coffee from the wall.\" the waiter served coffee to this man with  _  , politeness and warmth. After a few minutes, the man finished his coffee and left  _  paying. We were amazed to watch all this when the waiter  took off  a piece of paper from the wall and  _  it in the dust bin. Now it was no  _  for us because the situation was easy to understand. Although the man didn't know about the one who was giving this cup of coffee to him, he would have a better understanding of the wall which had a great role between the  _  and receiver.",
