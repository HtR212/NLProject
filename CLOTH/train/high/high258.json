    "article": "My name is Scott and I am 36 years old. I have spent most of my adult life doing an  _  job, so I had a very cynical view of life and the world around me. I saw no point in trying to  _  my life or the lives of the people around me. Two years ago my wife  _  me to return to school and work toward a career where I would find satisfaction. So I entered Long Beach City College to pursue a  _  in history. Last term I took a political science class. The  _  Dr. Rock had such a great effect on me. He  _  in the Air Force, worked in the U.S. nuclear program and served in the White House. When I asked another instructor  _  someone who was so overqualified worked at a small community college, she  _  told me because he wanted to. This  _  me, so I asked Dr. Rock himself why he did not pursue a better role in his career. What he told me has changed my  _  forever. He told me that by working at the college he would be able to  _  the kinds of students he believed would make a  _  in the world. He said that  _  the right motivation and support, the students he taught could become the future leaders of our country. He said that he preferred the inner city  _  because the students there showed the  _  promise and cared deeply for their education. Dr. Rock paid attention to the needs of the community. He taught me how to care and  _  us to take part in our community in any way we  _  . I thought that I was the  _  one that was affected by his lessons, but at the end of the term I found that the entire class had felt the same  _  that came over me. Dr. Rock taught us how to  care about  our country, our community and ourselves.",
