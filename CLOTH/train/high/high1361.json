Our teacher gave us a task called \"secret friends\" for the coming week.We were supposed to do nice things  _  our friends without letting them know who was doing it.We could leave  _  notes or cards either on their desks or in their backpacks.Before doing the task, with our eyes closed, from a basket, we  _  a name of a classmate who we were to secretly befriend over the next five days. Soon, the task was turned into a competition of giving  _  instead of notes.Everyone was getting cool presents except me.My friend  _  what the teacher had told us without a fault.I received nothing but hand-made cards with nice words about me. On the last morning, I finally got a package.When I  _  it, the girls around all  _  .It was perfumed powder, an \"old lady\" gift.My face went red. I tried to forget about the  _  gift, but when the same girls  _  it again during the break in the bathroom, I joined in, \"How stupid! My grandmother wouldn't  _  want it.\" The girls laughed at my  _  and filed out of the bathroom.Washing my hands, I let the water run through my fingers  _  I thought about my words.It wasn't  _  like me to say things like that. \"I'm your secret friend.\" It was Rochelle.\" I' m sorry about the gift,\" she  _  to me, tears streaming down her face.

I told her that I had only said those things to try to  fit in  . \"We aren't that different from each other, are we?\" She smiled  _  .Her simple words, spoken from her heart, found their way straight into mine.",
