I'll be 44 after 4 years of college.\" His friend said to him, \"Why not?Four years later you will be 44 whether or not you go to college.\" He  _  about it for a night and got the idea. The next day he went to sign at the college. One of my friends, Jim, did  _  with somebody else a few years ago. Their ship got  _  in the storm at sea and their hope, together with their goods  _  suddenly. Jim was so  _  by the blow that he became low-spirited and couldn't  _  focus his attention on his work. While his  _  who suffered the same catastrophe never  lost heart  . His day went on as colorfully as before. My friend asked him how he could  _  it. He said, \"When you complain, and feel sad, life goes on as usual; when you are happy and  _  yourself, the world runs as usual. Which do you  _  ?\" That's how a person leads his life. When you are  _  and in a good mood, your future seems sunny and bright.  On the contrary  , when you are worried and have something sad in your  _  , your future will turn dark. The latter situation will cost you a great deal  if  you allow it to last. You will  _  the joyful things. There is a poem that  _  \"Whether you are aware or not, whether you like or dislike, show attention or ignore , flowers bloom luxuriously all the same.\" Just as flowers keep blooming, fine days are  _  one after another.  _  to spend your days--joyfully or sorrowfully--will entirely depend on yourself.",
