I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a  _  ,little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that  lit up  her entire being. She said, \"Hi, handsome. My name is Rose. I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?\" I laughed and enthusiastically  _  , \"Of course you may!\" and she gave me a giant  _  . \"Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?\" I asked.

Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and she  _  made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she enjoyed the attention bestowed upon her from the other  _  . She was living it up. At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet. I'll never forget what she taught us. \"We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow  _  because we stop playing. There are only four  _  to staying young, being happy and achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You've got to have a dream. When you lose your  _  ,you die. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or  _  . The idea is to grow up by always finding opportunity in  _  . Have no regrets.\"",
