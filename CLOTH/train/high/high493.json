    "article": "I was tired and hungry after a long day of work. When I walked into the living room, my 12-year-old son looked   _   at me and said, \"I love you.\" I didn't know what to say.  _  several seconds all I could do was to stand there and   _   down at him. My first thought was that he must need   _   with his homework or he was trying to   _  me for some news. Finally I asked ,\"What was that all about ?\"\n\"Nothing.\" he said . \"My teacher said we should   _   our parents that we love them and see what they say. It's a(n)  _  .\"\nThe next day I called his teacher to find out more about this \"experiment\" and how the other parents had  _  .\n\"Basically, most of the fathers had the   _  reaction as you did ,\"the teacher said. \"When I first   _  we try this, I asked the children what they thought their parents would say. Some of them thought their parents would have heart trouble.\" \"The   _   is,\" the teacher explained. \"feeling lover is an important part of   _  .It's something all human beings  _  .What I'm trying to tell the children is that it's too  _  that we don't all express those feelings. A boy should be   able  to tell his dad that he loves him.\"\nThe teacher, a middle-aged man , understands how  _  it is for some of us to say the things that would be good for us to say.\nWhen my son came to me that evening , I held on to him for   an extra  second. And just  _  he pulled away , I said in my deepest , most manly voice , \"Hey, I love you , too.\"\nI don't know if saying that made either of us healthier , but it did feel pretty good. Maybe next time if my child says \" I love you\", it would not take me a whole  _  to think of the right  _  .",
