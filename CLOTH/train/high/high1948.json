    "article": "It was a rainy day. I was riding on a bus downtown to go to  _  . I was sitting next to a man in a business suit and didn't  _  much attention until we both got off at the same stop and walked to the same  _  to get a morning paper. The man running the stand was  _  having a bad day. He was  _  and unsmiling as we purchased our papers, which served to only  _  more gloom to my day. The businessman caught my eye and  _  . He then continued to smile  _  and thanked the newsstand owner for the  _  and for being open on such a morning to make sure we were able to get our papers.  In short  , he expressed his appreciation for something most of us would take for granted. The newsman  _  only with a cold expression. The businessman then pleasantly wished him a pleasant day. As we  turned away  , I asked this man why he had  _  to be pleasantto the newsman when he obviously didn't care about and didn't respond to his expression of  _  and friendliness. The businessman smiled at me and said, \"Why would I let someone else  _  what I say and what I feel or what kind of day I'm going to have?\" We then  _  to go to our respective work places. To this day, I don't know anything about that business man. But I've never  _  the words he said or the way his smile seemed like a ray of light on a gloomy day. That was a good deed 25 years ago, but the  _  this had on my life has lasted. I never had a  _  to thank him personally, but the way in which I choose to look at life as a result of those words is his legacy to me and my thanks to him. We cannot control people and situations that come to us, but we can always control our response to them. And in such  _  decisions lie our control and personal power to make a positive difference. And it's something anyone and everyone can do.",
