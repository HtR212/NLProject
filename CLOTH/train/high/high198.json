    "article": "Whenever I recall my childhood, there is one thing I remember clearly. My father used his   _   to let my mother   _   her parents who lived far away. There was just my younger brother and myself in the  _  . One evening, our father came home and there was no   _  , not even a piece of bread. My father had no money and he was as   _   as we were. My brother and I went to bed without having anything. \n  _   I knew from the expressions on my father's face that he could not   _   us be hungry for long. He left the house, and about two hours later he   _   and woke us up. He had two small potato pies in his hands. I didn't know where he got the money for the food but somehow he   _   to find a way. It was clear that he wanted to get his children   _  . \nMy father did not eat and had   _   all day but he sat there and felt   _   at seeing us eat. This has always stuck in my   _  . At that moment, I felt   _   knowing that he tried his best not to let us   _  , and he wanted us to know he was always there with us.\nIn   _   times, I think, it is important not to   _   weakness but strength.   _   the mother is the cement   that   _   a family together, then the father is the steel that strengthens   that cement. \nIt is his values and   _   that have carried me forward and helped me deal with my own problems in life.",
