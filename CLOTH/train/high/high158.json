He was  _  a program he had designed to help prisoners with drug and alcohol problems. He was always  coming up with  new ways to bring hope and help to these men and their  _  . One of his favorite  _  was the Toy Drive he would run every Christmas for the children of the prisoners. He did this for twenty years  _  his sudden death.

When Christmas Eve finally arrived, I felt very happy, thinking I had done all I could do and reflecting on what a(n)  _  it had been for me.

My daughter and I drove all night, from New York to Kentucky, and those children woke up in a nice warm house with plenty of  _  ! My friend's  _  of kindness lived on that year, reaching all the way to Kentucky!",
