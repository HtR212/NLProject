    "article": "Richard's father died when he was five. Later on he  _  his mother again. The poor boy had to live on his own, so he went to work for a rich farmer, who paid him nothing except food and clothes. An old woman felt  _  for him and often helped him. The boy wanted to go to  _  very much, but he had no money. But he never gave up and found some old books near the school and  _  himself to read and write. There was a narrow path between two mountains which connected the village and the town. One morning people  _  there was a big stone on the path. It brought them difficulty: they had to cross the mountains to the town, or they had to move it away.  _  the stone weighed at least thirty tons and even the strongest young man couldn't move it. They  _  for a long time, but nobody knew what to do. Richard looked at it carefully for a while and said, \"I have a  _  to move it away.\" But  _  people believed him. Some villagers even laughed at him. The night fell and people went back. Only the boy stayed there. To their surprise, the villagers found the stone was  _  the next morning. They didn't know who had moved it away. The old woman said Richard had done it all by himself. \"How could he?\" the rich farmer called out, \"He's  _  fifteen! He couldn't move it at all!\" \"He dug a big hole beside the stone.\" said the old woman, \"and then he could  _  push it into the hole!\" Looking at each other, the villagers couldn't say a word.",
