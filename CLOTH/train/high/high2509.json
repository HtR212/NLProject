    "article": "When I began teaching in a university, I was invited to a workshop for new professors. I had  _  a long time learning what to teach, but not learning how to  _  it. Somehow, my university seemed to hope a weekend spent with experienced professors would  make up  for that. My colleagues presented wellcrafted lectures about the tools they used. I enjoyed their  _  , but do not remember a thing they said. At a coffee break during the lectures, finding myself  _  , I turned to a mathematics professor standing nearby. I asked him what his favorite teaching  _  was. \"A cup of coffee,\" he said, \"I talk too much and too fast in the classroom. Students sometimes have trouble  _  me. So when I've said  _  that I want my students to think about, I would  _  and take a sip of coffee. It lets what I've just said sink in.\" When we were called to the next talk, he put down his cup and I  _  there was not a trace of coffee in it. \"My doctor  _  me to stop drinking coffee,\" he explained. \"So I have always used a(n)  _  cup.\" I decided to try his  _  in my class. I took a cup of coffee with me to my next class. It helped. My pauses, as I  _  the coffee, not only gave my students  _  to think about what I had said, but gave me time to think about what I was going to say next. I began to use my  _  to look around the room to see how my students were reacting to what I had just said. When I saw their  _  wander, I tried to bring them back. When I saw them puzzled over some concept that I thought I had  _  , I gave another example. My  _  became less organized and less brilliant, but my students seemed to  _  me better.",
