Experts advised euthanasia  as the best choice. Instead, Ruta, 27, retrained the  _  she was given on her 13thbirthday and the pair are  _  together again.\nTwo years ago, one of the horse's eyes developed a cataract and Ruta was told he might go  _  . When he did go  _  blind, some people said the best thing to do would be to put him down. But one vet saw him and gave a(n)  _  opinion. He said the connection between the  _  was so strong that he would trust her to do anything with the horse.\nSo, for the next six months, Ruta would teach Prince to  _  her other senses to get around. She used wind chimes  to  _  him to his food. She played the radio before walks. She lifted his head to encourage him to  _  his legs when walking up hills. The  _   helped improved Prince's weak legs and put a(n)  _  on his owner's face.\nRuta thought she could not face the idea of  _  the horse who helped her through so much as a teenager,  _  after losing her father when she was 15. When she first got the horse, she fell in love with him and  _  every weekend with him.\nRuta, who is a vet at Wild Life Sydney Zoo, said she hoped her  _  ould encourage others not to  give up  when things get difficult. \"It takes  _  and patience,\" she said, \"It was so challenging but it was   _  in the end.\"",
