    "article": "Five years ago, when it was time for my cousin to start college, my 75-year-old grandfather, Rex, decided to do the same. He went to  _  , taking classes twice a week until his death last summer. As a student, my grandfather spent countless hours in his office  _  and completing assignments. Although he was twice as  _  as his professors, he loved going. He said,\"You can never  _  too much, no matter how old you are.\"He loved everything about school. Learning new things was truly his passion. My grandfather's will to learn was a great  _  for me to do my best in school. We were always  _  with each other, trying to bring home the better grade. When he turned 80 and still had a full head of hair, my grandfather felt like he could take on the  _  . He felt like he could beat the unstoppable no matter what came in his way---whether it was his continuing with cancer  _  a tough professor. Some people look to Superman or Batman as their  _  , but my grandfather will forever be my hero, the  _  who always came to my rescue. My grandfather was made the hall of fame at his high school as one of the school's most successful football players. When I did some research I  _  that his nickname was Atlas. In Greek mythology , Atlas held the heavens on his shoulders. For my grandfather's football team, he was  _  Atlas, holding the team together. He was my Atlas too, as the foundation of our family. In my times of need he was always there to  _  me and celebrate my accomplishments. I could count on him to help me out and stand by me. The strength he  _  with me will continue to hold me up as I forever keep his memory  _  in my heart and mind.",
