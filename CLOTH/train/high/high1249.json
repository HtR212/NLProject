A close friend   _   me to the town where she lived. Though I knew I should sell my house and   _     to another place, there was no way I could handle the mortgage   until it was   _  , and pay for an apartment.\nMy friend invited me to live with her, free of   _   . She had a large home, and though I  _  considered it, I didn't want to become a burden  . I told her it could take months or even    _  to sell my house. But she said she knew that and didn't    _   , so I moved into her home, which was several states   _  .\nNot only did I    _   with her for over a year, but when my house was sold, she went with me on the long   _   (14 hours). We used her car, because it was newer and much more   _  than mine.\nWhen I finally got to my own place, she said that she knew I might   _   pay her back financially  , and she didn't ever   _   that. She said that someday if I got the  _  , I should pass it on to someone else who needed some help, and that the \"generosity\" need not be   _  .\nWhat she did for me was   _   . It wasn't just the sharing of her home; she taught me that the best way to   get through   sadness was to reach out and help someone else.\nI will never   _  her generosity; and I always try to find ways, no matter how small, to share a little kindness with others every day.",
