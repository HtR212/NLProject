    "article": "I first met Sean one summer day. He carried a bag  _  with four clubs and some balls. He was a lot  _  than other kids of his age. I heard he was  _  from cancer. Still , he always seemed to be smiling whenever I would see him with his friends, trying to  _  as far as he did. A year or so passed and I hadn't  _  Sean .I had heard that his cancer was  getting the best of  him. Still, his friends said he was going to come here before long.  _  enough , he was there the following week. I  _  that one of his friends was carrying Sean's bag. I saw Sean was having a(n)  _  time trying to drive the ball. Sean hit his last ball as hard as his fragile body would  _  .It flew up to the green and was out of sight. One of his friends  _  Sean walk up to the green. It was a(n)  _  walk because the green was higher than the tee . Suddenly I saw one boy pick up Sean's ball and  _  it in the hole. Then he ran and  _  to look for his own ball. When Sean finally got to the green, he looked  _  because he thought he hit it over . Then he glanced in the hole. A smile  lit up  his face! The boys looked at each other and said , \"You can't tell me it's a hole-in-one!\" \"No, really ! Look !\" he said . They all acted  _  and as I watched , I thought Sean looked like the  _  guy I had ever seen. I never saw Sean or his friends after that day.  _  it was then that I learned just what golf should be . It's not about what  _  you get or how far you drive. It is about caring for the friends you play with and enjoying the time you have with them.",
