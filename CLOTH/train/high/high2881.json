He's pleasant and   _  a lot.\nWhen we walk by each other in the hallway we smile and say hi, Actually, he says, \"Hi, Joe.\" I just say \"Hi,\"   _     ,well, I don't know his name, and I'm  _  to ask. I mean, he's been here for a couple weeks. I  _  know his name. But I don't.\nLast week I  _  one\nof his colleagues talking to him. I listened for a minute to see if his  _  was mentioned. The new guy mentioned the other person's name a\ncouple of times, but the other person  _  called the\nnew guy  _  name.\nI passed him in the hall again yesterday. He said \"Hi, Joe.\" And I said \"Hey, how's it going?\" And I moved on down the hall feeling  _  about how well I was coping with\nnot knowing his name, when I heard a  _  voice behind\nme.\n\"I don't know you!\"\nIt was Sylvia, one of the kindest, most   _  people I know. She has been walking a\nfew paces behind me, and  _  she didn't know the new\nguy either. But  rather than  just smile and say \"hi\", Sylvia did  _  Sylvia does. Not only did she  _  that she didn't know him, but she also asked him his name, told him her\nname and  _  him in conversation. And suddenly for\nSylvia, the new guy wasn't the new guy and more. He was Mitch, a colleague with\nchildren, hobbies, interests and a little shared history.\nI was   _  by\nthe ease with which Sylvia had made that change. It turns out it doesn't  _  much to turn an unfamiliar face in the hall into a  _  .\nYou just have to get over yourself and  reach out  a\nlittle. Ask a question. Learn a name. And just like that - no more new guys.",
