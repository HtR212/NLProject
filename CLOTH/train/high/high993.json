    "article": "Can one man make a difference? Ask Rossano Ercolini, the 2013 Goldman Prize winner, which is considered the Nobel Prize for \"  _  \". Ercolini is a young  _  in a small town in Italy. After  _  the news of reducing waste on the radio, he decided to teach his students to  _  paper and replace plastic water bottles in the school lunchroom with  _  glasses.\nWhen his town announced plans to open an incinerator ( ) to burn waste, Ercolini knew it would be  _  for his students. Incinerators are huge heaters that burn all waste and poisonous material, leaving behind  _  . You might think it is  _  than sending waste to landfills. It is true landfills  take up  space, smell bad, and that poisonous materials can make underground drinking water  _  to use. But incinerators have their own  _  . Burning gives off poisonous gases into the air which can cause  _  problems. People will have to wear a mask no matter  _  they go. The smoke also causes pollution, and even  _  the greenhouse effect.\nErcolini was worried about the  _  of his community and felt it was his duty to  _  them. He organized town hall meetings, and talked about how to reduce, reuse and recycle.  _  , Ercolini has advocated the zero-waste movement, the  _  of which is to reduce the waste sent to landfills and incinerators to the least possible amount. He has already  _  plans for more than 50 incinerators in many Italian cities.  Thanks to  his efforts, there are more than one hundred zero-waste towns in Italy now!",
