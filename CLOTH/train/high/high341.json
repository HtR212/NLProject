    "article": "I have many funny stories in my childhood .The first one that  comes into  my mind is the story of my first camera. It happened 20 years ago . Just when I was ready to go to school , my grandmother  _  me a new camera from the supermarket as a present . Even if my mother wasn't too happy about what I had   _   , I asked my father if I could take my camera to my   _   so that I could take pictures with my classmates . He agreed and showed me how it   _   . It was very easy.\nAt school I showed it to all my   _   and we took a lot of pictures,   _   they were not too great . The photo with my friends was the worst as I didn't take Tom's head ; instead I   _   his sandwich . The boys were interested in my camera ,   _  Daniel who said he had a   _   one with a flashlight . He explained to us that the flashlight helped to take pictures in the   _   but I accused him of being a liar . Like all boys we started fighting .   _   ,our teacher separated us .After explaining to him the reason of the fight , I    _   him not to take my camera away.\nWhen my parents knew what had happened , they weren't glad . My mother punished me for being   _   . She took the camera in order to   _  further problems , telling me that for a boy like me the camera was not a good   _    to play with.\nTo make her   _   about the fight , I took a picture with her and Dad with the film left . In a couple of days Dad   _   the films and brought the photos home , saying I wasn't good at taking pictures at all . I got   _   and argued that we all learnt from our   _  .",
