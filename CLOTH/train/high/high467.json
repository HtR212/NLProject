    "article": "A family owned a farm near Beulah, Michigan U.S. They kept a bull   chained to   an old elm tree. The bull walked around the tree,   _   a heavy iron chain with him, which cut a trench   on the surface of the tree about three feet off ground. The trench   _   over the years, though for whatever   _  , it didn't kill the tree. Later, the family sold the   _   and took their bull to their new home in another state. They cut the chain,   _   the iron ring behind around the tree. Over the years, bark    _   covered the rusting   chain.\nThen one year, an agricultural disaster   _   Michigan. All of the elms lining the road leading to the farm became   _   with the disease and died. Everyone figured that the old, badly wounded elm could hardly   _  . The farm's owners even considered cutting down the tree   _   it died. But they simply   _   to do so. It was as if the old tree had become a family friend. So they decided to leave it as it was.\n  _  , the tree didn't die! Year after year it   grew well  . Nobody could understand why it was the only elm still standing there.   _  experts came over to study the tree. They observed the trench left by the iron chain, now almost completely covered by bark and badly corroded  . The experts   _   that it was the rusting chain that saved the elm's life. They   _   that the tree must have absorbed so much iron from the rusting chain that it became   _   to the disease.\nIt is said that what doesn't kill you will make you   _  . Or, as Ernest Hemingway put it, \"Life   _   us all, but afterwards, many of us are strongest at the broken places.\"",
