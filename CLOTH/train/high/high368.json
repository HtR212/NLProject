    "article": "Last year, for a nationwide teacher conference, I was asked to make a presentation about my classroom. I immediately  _  to offer to the conference photo collections and mementos that would prove how meaningful teachers' work was in the world of classroom. So, for weeks, I looked  _  the drawers, boxes, and cupboard, hoping to find just the right prints that would tell of the spirit of my school and my community. All through September, I sought photos of lessons activties and accounts I had put away  _  in my house. I asked my colleagues to help me find images or objects that would  _  our most famous community members. By mid-October, I had made a list of them. But, I had also found something  _  , something much more dear, and very rare. I found photos of Craig, a high school senior, who gave up two weeks one summer to help little kids draw pictures at a camp. I found notes from Calvin whom I had taught for almost six years, and remembered how he always made sure every classmate felt accepted. I found a resume written by Carrie who  _  herself without the help of parents, and who took night class, and never  _  one. I found a copy of Macbeth in Portuguese, which belonged to an exchange student who read it first in her own  _  , before reading it in ours. Thus she could be sure she wasn't missing anything important in the  _  . I found all my students, the students who had made me laugh, the students who had  _  me with their courage and kindness, the students who had  _  me to question what I knew of the world outside my own world, the students who had inspired me to expect more from them and from myself. There I was, standing at my filing cupboard reviewing  _  --not those I had taught, but the many I had learned. I came to teaching,  as  most teachers do, hoping to touch the hearts and minds of my students. What I never expected was how  _  they would touch mine. Today I walk through the door of my classroom ready to teach, but also  _  to learn from the young people who are excited to teach me about them --their insights and interests, problems and anxieties, hopes and expectations.",
