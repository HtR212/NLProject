    "article": "The day I met my best friend for the first time, I was full of anxiety. I was trying to do some  _  for an important oral exam in the local library, but people kept  _  me. I was getting annoyed and of course, I was not able to  _  . Suddenly I beard someone singing loudly behind me. I  turned around  and glared at the person who was singing. It was a tall girl about the same age as me. She looked like a sensitive and friendly girl, which didn't matter. If anything, it made me even angrier. \"How could she be so selfish?\" I thought  _  . I picked up my books, glared at her and whispered coldly, \"Thanks to your  _  , I've been unable to study. You're so  _  !\" I left the library in a hurry, leaving my most important textbook  _  . When I got home two hours later, I found that textbook gone. I was so  _  that I almost cried. Just then, the phone rang. A gentle voice  _  the speaker as Jenny and asked if I was Jane. After  _  that I was, she said she had noticed I'd left my book in tile library and as my  _  was in it, she'd asked a librarian to get my phone number. She said she didn't live far away and could bring it around for me if I needed it. I sighed with  _  and agreed to meet her at the convenience store down the road. Of course, you've  _  who Jenny was. She was just the gift I had shouted at for singing in the library. When I recognized her in the store, I was filled with  _  and apologized for my rude behavior. I felt so  _  , but Jenny just laughed, saying She was glad to see I'd also left my  _  in the library! I couldn't help laughing at this and I invited her to my apartment for a cup of tea. Ever since then we've been best friends and we're getting along well. To be honest, I trust her more than anyone else. I often think how  _  I am. If Jenny hadn't been a kind person who was willing to  _  my shortcomings, I would  _  have experienced such true friendship.",
