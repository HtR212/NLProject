    "article": "When I was a small child, during the war, we were very poor and we lived in a faraway village. One day, on the road, I found the  _  pieces of a mirror. There was a German motorcycle accident. I tried to find all the pieces and put them  _  , but it was not possible, so I kept only the  _  piece and I made it round. I began to  _  with it as a toy and became greatly attracted by the  _  that I could reflect light to dark places where the sun would never shine in  _  holes and some other dark places. It became a  _  for me to get light into the darkest places I could find. I  _  the little mirror, and, as I  _  up, I would take it out when I had nothing to do and  _  the game. As I became a  _  , I grew to understand that this was not  _  a child's game but a metaphor for what I might do with my life. I came to  _  that I am not the light or the source of light, but light--truth, understanding, knowledge--is  _  , and it will shine in many dark places only if I reflect it. I am just a single piece of a mirror whose  _  design and shape I do not know.  _  , with what I have I can reflect light into the dark places of this  _  , into the black places in the  _  of men--and change some things  _  some people. Perhaps others may see and do the same. This is what I am about. This is the  _  of my life. ( )",
