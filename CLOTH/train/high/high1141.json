And even worse was that  _  when I realized only half of the white insect was left there on top of my green vegetables. I informed the  _  of my problem and I did not expect him to  _  and tell me that insects were a good source of protein. I am a vegetarian! In fact, I have eaten in your restaurant many times  _  and this is the first time I have been  _  . And I do not feel we should have been  _  for this meal, so I would ask you to  _  the cost. I await your reply. Yours faithfully, Mr. John Smith",
