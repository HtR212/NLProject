    "article": "My  family  suffered  a  lot  three  years  ago  when  my  father  died  in  a  car  accident.  It  _  my  mother,  two  younger  brothers  and  me  alone.\nAt  that  time,  I  was  in  a  senior  high  school.  As  the  eldest  son,  I  had  no  choice  but  to  drop out  of  school  and  work  in  a  factory.  Life  went  on  without  any  wonder.  I  dared  not  ask  for  more  and  just  thought  about  bringing up  my  two  brothers.  However,  it  wasn't  easy,  for  I  couldn't  _  their  tuition     even  if  I  worked  from  day  to  night  without  rest.  I  also  had  to  look  after  my  sick  mother.  I  wanted  to  go  back  to  school,  but  it  seemed  to  be  an  impractical  idea,  since  I  needed  to  work  to  support  my  family.\nA  thread  of  _  appeared  during  those  gloomy     days.  It  was  a  rainy  dusk  when  I  went  outside  into  the  rain  and  walked  in  the  street.  Suddenly  the  rain  stopped!  I  raised  my  head,  and  found  that  \"the  sky\"  was  in  fact  a  dark  blue  umbrella.  Then  I  heard  a  deep  voice  say,  \"Why  not  _  without  an  umbrella?\"  It  was  a  one-legged  man,  \"If  you  run,  you  won't  get  so  wet.\"  His  words  _  me  deeply.  Without  my  father's  protection,  was  I  only  a  slave  to  fate ?\nWhile  walking  with  him  in  the  rain,  I  knew  that  his  dream  was  once  _  by  an  accident.  He  was  glad  that  he  didn't  lose  _  and  still  \"ran\"  on  the  road  of  life.  Facing  this  guy,  I  had  no  pity,  but  admiration.\nInspired  by  his  _  ,  I  went  to  a  city  in  the  south  and  became  an  insurance  representative.  After  two  years'  \"running\",  I  got  somewhere  and  my  family  situation  became  better  _  .  I  went  back  to  school  and  eventually  succeeded  in  being  admitted  to  a  university.\nEverything  is  so  simple:  to  run  without  an  umbrella!  When  you  run  out  of  the  _  season  of  your  life,  there  will  be  a  bright  sky  ahead  of  you.",
