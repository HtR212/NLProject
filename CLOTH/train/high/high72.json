He let the first one   _  . Then another, and another. Finally, when the   _   rider come close, the old man stopped him and said, \"Sir, would you mind   _   an old man a ride? There doesn't appear to be a way to go by   _   .\"\n\"Sure. Hop   _  ,\" the rider replied. Seeing that the old man unable to get on all by himself, the horseman   got off   and helped him onto the horse. The horseman took the old man not just across the river,   _   to his house.\nWhen they got to the old man's house, the horseman's   _   caused him to ask, \"Sir, I noticed that you let other riders pass by without   _   any effort to ask for a ride. Then I came up and you   _   asked me. What if I had refused and left you there?\"\nThe old man looked the rider 54 _  in the eyes and replied, \"I looked into the   _   of the other riders and immediately saw that there was no   _   for my situation. It would have been   _  to ask them for a ride. But when I looked into your eyes, your   _   was quite obvious. I knew,  then and there  , that you were sure to give me help in my time of need.\"\nThose words touched the horseman deeply. \n\"I'm very grateful for what you have said,\" he told the old man. \"May I never be too busy in my own affairs that I   _   to help others with my kindness.\"\nWith that, Thomas Jefferson turned his horse around and made his way back to the White House.",
