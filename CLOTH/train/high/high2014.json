I am an incredibly lucky person who has come from a family  _  there is full of love and support.\nI have to be the one to make the  _  to change my way of thinking.\nAll the good things and all the wonderful people in my life would pass eventually too.  _  I am feeling miserable, my life is still going on and I am missing out on  _  those precious moments.\nWe all have terrible things which happen to us and will  _  each of us differently.\nThe most important thing to remember is that our  _  aren't what define us. What defines us is how we  deal with  what has happened to us and how we change the way we think about it.\nWe can either let it become us or we can use our newly-found  _  to change the little bit of world around us all.\nThere's something much bigger than us and our problems. It is always  _  to remember that there is always someone who is in a  _  much worse than our own.\nNevertheless, I am well on the  _  to becoming the person I want to be and I have goals and expectations of myself. I am now  _  that my life has started.\nIt started years ago and it's not  _  over yet. It's happening right now. Yours is too.",
