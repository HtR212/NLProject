At first, he wanted to carry it out of the sandbox with his hands; however, it was too heavy. Later, with much  _  , he pushed the rock across the sandbox by  _  his hands. When the boy got the rock to the  _  of the sandbox, he found that he couldn't roll it up and  _  the little wall.  _  , the little boy pushed, but every time he thought he had made some  _  , the rock tipped and then fell back into the sandbox. The little boy pushed and pushed, but his only  _  was to have the rock roll back. Finally he  burst into  tears. All this time the boy's father watched from his living room window  _  the drama was unfolded. The moment the tears fell, a large  _  appeared across the sandbox. It was the boy's father. Gently but  _  , he said, \"Son, why didn't you use all the strength that you had?\" Defeated, the boy  _  back, \"I did! I did! I used all the strength that I had!\" \"No, you didn't. You didn't ask me for help.\" The father  _  down, picked up the rock and dropped it off the sandbox. Do you have \"rocks\" in your life that need to be  _  ? Are you discovering that you don't have  _  it takes to lift them? There is someone who is willing to give us the  _  we need.
