    "article": "We are all interested in equality, but while some people try to protect the school and examination system in the name of equality, others, still in the name of equality, want only to destroy it. Any society which is interested in equality of opportunity and standards of achievement must  _  test its pupils. The standards may be changed -- no examination is  _  -- but to have no tests or examinations would mean the end of equality and of standards. There are groups of people who oppose this view and who do not  _  either in examinations or in any controls in school or on teachers. This would mean everything would depend on  _  since every pupil would depend on efficiency, the values and the purpose of each  _  . Without examinations, employers will look for employees from the  _  respected schools and from families known to them - a form of favoritism will replace equality. At the moment, the bright child from an ill-respected school can show certificates to prove he is  _  for a job, while the lack of a certificate indicates the unsuitability of a  _  child attending a well-respected school. This defense of excellence and opportunity would disappear if examinations were  taken away  , and the bright child from a poor family would be a prisoner of his or her school's reputation, unable to  _  for employment with the child from the  _  school. The opponents of the examination system suggest that examinations are an  _  force because they show differences between pupils. According to these people, there must be no special,  _  or academic class. They have even suggested that there should be no form of difference in sport or any other area: all jobs or posts should be filled by unsystematic  _  . The selection would be made by people who themselves are  _  selected by some computer.",
