When I  _  high school, I wrote to the Minister of Education and Sports to  _  me for a degree. Frequently visiting his  _  for over three months, at last I was to meet the minister. I  woke up  that morning and told myself, \"You will see the minister today!\" I went to his office and the secretary told me to  come back  next time. I asked, \"When?\" She said, \"Afternoon.\" At exactly 12:01 pm I was at the door, knocked and entered. The minister had  _  a note, which was used to introduce me to the president. The following day, I went to the president's office with a smile on my face. I  _  myself with the minister's note and was welcomed. I  _  got the financial assistance.
