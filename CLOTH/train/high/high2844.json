    "article": "As a child, I started learning to play the piano, my favorite musical   _  ,but I was forced to give up when I started my middle school   so that   I could concentrate more on my studies.\n It's one of my biggest   _  to stop practicing the piano when I recall sadly today. During the following years, I kept telling my piano teacher that I would  _  . However, I didn't keep my promise because I was   _   with my study.   _   I lost touch with my teacher. Some years later, my teacher died. I was very sad because I lost such a good teacher. She was a very warm and gentle person. It hurts me to think she may have been   _   that I never returned. I haven't taken lessons since then but to be honest, I   _   to. Sitting at the piano, I couldn't help recalling many   _  -- times of my practising at home and playing before my teacher and one time my teacher   _   me after I played entire pieces of music wrong in front of her colleagues. I was so  _   that I could hardly say anything. But her  _   helped ease my shame. These memories,   _  , good or bad, never caused my   _   for playing the piano again.\n This thought then led me to think that  _  is like music, and that we all try to play different   _  in the instrument of our life. Sometimes the pitch  is   _  when we play it well, but sometimes we are out of tone. However, we all continue to create our own   _  style of music. No matter what style our music is, it is   _   that we sing the songs of joy, quietness and love. Though I may never make it back to piano lessons, it doesn't  _   that I've stopped making music.",
