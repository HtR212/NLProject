    "article": "Knowing how much her own children loved presents at Christmas, Ann Sutton, a social worker, always tried to seek help for one or two poor families. This year, Kinzie, Ann's seven-year-old daughter, was  _  that Santa Claus would make a special visit to a young mother named Ashley who worked in a factory and was  _  her 12-month-old son, Evan, and her 12-year-old brother, Kenny, by herself. At a  _  dinner, the phone rang. A representative from a local charity was calling to say that the  _  Ann had requested for Ashley had been cancelled. No Santa Claus, no presents, nothing. Ann saw the cheer fade away from her children's faces at the news. Without a word, she  _  down from her chair and ran from the room. Now, it didn't feel much  _  Christmas anymore. Kinzie returned, her face set with determination. She had opened up her piggy  _  , and now she counted out the coins and broken dollar  _  , one by one, onto the dining table: $3.30. Everything she had. \"Mom,\" she told Ann, \"I know it's not much.  _  maybe this will buy a present for the baby.\" Then  _  everyone was reaching into pockets and purses. Adding to Kinzie's gift became a game, with everyone  _  for loose change. By the time the search ended, there was a small mountain of bills and a neat pile of coins. The  _  : $130, plenty for a Christmas for three. \"God multiplied your gift,\" Ann said to Kinzie. That evening, Kinzie went with her mother and sister to  _  the money. On Christmas Eve, Ann  _  through the pouring rain to the small cottage where the family lived. When Ashley opened the door, Ann stood under her umbrella and  _  the astonished woman a merry Christmas. Then she began to  _  the gifts from the car, handing them to Ashley one by one. Ashley laughed in disbelief, and still the presents came. Ann abandoned the umbrella, and the young woman joined her in the rain, passing gifts  _  to Kenny. \"Please, can I open up just one tonight?\" he begged. Soon both women were  _  to the skin, and surprise had turned to something  _  , the kind of joy that brought them close to tears. Reflecting on a little girl's generosity, Ashley says she hopes she'll one day be able to do something similar for someone else in  _  . \"Kinzie could have used that money for herself, but she gave it away,\" Ashley says. \"She's the type of kid I'd like my son to grow up to be.\"",
