    "article": "A senior monk and a junior monk were traveling together. One day, they came to a  _  with a strong current. As the monks were  _  to cross the river, they saw a very young and beautiful woman. She asked if they could help her  _  to the other side.\nThe two monks glanced at one another because they had  _  not to have physical contact with women.\nThen, without a word, the older monk  picked up  the woman, carried her across the river,  _  her gently on the other side, and carried on his journey.\nThe younger monk couldn't believe  _  had just happened. After rejoining his companion, he was  _  , and several hours passed without a word between them.\n  _  , the younger monk couldn't contain himself any longer, and asked, \"As monks, we are not permitted to have body contact with a woman; how could you then  _  that woman?\"\nThe  _  monk looked at him and replied, \"Brother, I set her down on the other side of the river, why are you  _  carrying her?\"\nThis simple Zen story has a beautiful message about living in the  _  moment. How often do we carry around past  _  , holding onto dislikes when the only person we are really  _  is ourselves?\nWe all  go through  times in life when other people say things or  _  in a way that does harm to us. We can  _  to think carefully over past actions or events, but it will finally weigh us down and use up our energy.\nInstead, we can choose to let go of what doesn't serve us anymore and  _  on the present moment. Until we can find a level of peace and  _  in the present circumstances of our lives, we will never be content, because \"now\" is all we will ever have.",
