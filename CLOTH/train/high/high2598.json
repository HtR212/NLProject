I also decided that I would have a unique   _   to give her a great surprise.\nI started out months   in advance  , writing poems and   _   with my wife's friends and got their help in making cards for each of the twenty-two poems.\nHad I known how   _   it was to make twenty-two cards for twenty-two poems, I might have   come up with   a different idea.   _  , by the time I was about to   give up  , I was encouraged by our   _  , so I kept on the task.\nSome good friends   _   to host the party at their house. The question then was how to get my wife to the party without raising her   _  . I told my wife for our anniversary I would make a(n)   _   at a nice restaurant, so she didn't have to   _   anything. I had prearranged with the party host to call me before the party to say that she really needed to get back a   _   that I had borrowed. In my wife's   _  , I told him that we were heading out to dinner and could drop the book off on our way.\nFinally, when we arrived at the   _  , I suggested that perhaps Sheila should accompany me to the door and say a quick   _  . We stepped into the house where the   _   happened. One at a time, twenty-one of Sheila's friends presented her with a card and rose. Then, I   _   a poem titled \"Pure Luck\". I wanted   _   to get it right--and I did!\nThat was five years ago, and I can still recited the whole poem by heart.",
