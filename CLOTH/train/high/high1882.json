He was watching a show  in which  there were college students going to a gettogether in Washington DC, and  _  the thousands who gathered there to celebrate something. When they got there, they started becoming  _  in drinking, and doing drugs. I didn't want to watch it any more, so got up and went to bed. About 330 a.m. I awoke, and lay there thinking about  the program  , and a poem began forming in my mind, which began as, \"  _  sin(something wrong)comes calling, or knocking at your door, run away, don't delay,  _  sin is like a magnet, and it will pull you down, run away, do not  _  .\" As I lay there, there was music which  came along with  it, and I knew that there was no way I would remember it by  _  , so I got up and sat at the table, trying to  put down  both the words and the music which came to me at the time.  _  the pattern was set, and I had the notes written down in my notebook, the  _  of the poem came to me as well. When it got  _  I decided to sit down at the piano and began trying to play it. My family came into the sitting room and I told them about the song, and wanted to  _  it with them. They all liked it, and  _  several times that day, I sang it again, and played it again, trying to fix it in my  _  . Later, I wanted to put the song on paper  instead of  just the little dots in my notebook indicating how high and how  _  to go. Not knowing how to do that, I  _  the song, and then sent it to my sister, Jennie, who had written many songs using her own poetry and music, and soon, here came the music and words all done up  _  . I was so glad.",
