    "article": "People often say that the Englishman's home is his castle . They mean that the home is very important and personal. Most people in Britain live in houses  rather than  flat, and many people own their homes. This means that they can make them individual  ;They can   paint  them and change them in any way they  _  .In a crowded city the individual knows that he or she has a private space  which is  _    for himself or herself and for  _  friends.\n    People usually like to mark their space . Are you sitting now in your home or in a beach or a train? If you are on the beach you may have spread your  _  around you; on the train you may have  _  your coat or small bag on the seat beside you; in a library you may have one corner or chair which is your own.\n    Once I was traveling on a   _  to London. I was in a section for four people and there was a table between us. The man on the  _  side to me had his briefcase on the table. There was no   _  on my side of the table at all. I was made rather     _  . I thought he thought that he owned the  _  table. I took various papers out of my bag and put them on  his case  ! When I did this he stiffened and his eyes nearly popped out of his head. I had invaded   his space ! A few minutes later I took my papers   off   his case in order to read them. He immediately   _  his case to his side of the table. ( Of course , it is possible that he just wanted to be helpful to me ! )",
