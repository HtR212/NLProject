We have the double-hung    _    that you can pull forward and flip , allowing us to   _   the inside and the outside surfaces.\n    My husband was   _   one window---and it popped out  of its frame! Well, our   _  is for sale and the last thing we needed was for something to   _   .\n    He was so    _    and tried with all his strength to get it    _    together, using a few less than pleasant words(I am sorry to say). After twenty minutes he still could not get it    _   .that's when my 23-year-old   _   told his dad to    walk away    for a minute and he would try to fix with me.\nIt's amazing how you can see things more clearly and do things more   _   when you are    _   . He and I fixed the window in three minutes! I called my husband in to see! He couldn't    believe   it!\n   I know this isn't really a gift   _   , in a way, it was. My son   _   my husband to leave, to cool down, and    _    him from the worry for a moment. And my son fixing it with me was a    _   to me, because I saw him as a man instead of the kid he always seems to be in my   _   .\n   Calm is good. Breathe through    _    times and maybe even take a break from stressful times. Return with a clear mind and things will usually   turn out   much better!",
