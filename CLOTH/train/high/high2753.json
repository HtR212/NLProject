    "article": "Basketball is a sport enjoyed by millions of people in at least 100 countries. It's one of the  best known  sports in the world. It began in 1891. Dr. James A. Naismith, the father of basketball, was a teacher of YMCA training school. It trained the people to work in YMCAs. Officials at the school were  _  about the low attendance during the  _  months. They  _  that people didn't attend then  _  the school did not have a good sports program in winter. So they asked Dr. Naismith for  help  . He came up with a new indoor game. Naismith studied games being played at that time. He found that all the most  _  games used a ball. So a ball would be part of his new game, he decided. But  _  the ball or hitting it would be too  _  for indoors. So he put two  _  up on the poles. The players had to try to  _  a ball into them. Naismith then made thirteen  _  for the game. Twelve of them are still in  _  today. Just seven  _  after the game began professional basketball teams were  _  . And that's how basketball was born.",
