Suddenly, I noticed that the house near mine had been sold. An elderly lady was in front of the door, with some beautiful   _   beside her. I walked to her. She looked to be in her early eighties and had the prettiest white hair.\n\"Hi! My name is Karmen,\" I said,   _   brightly at the old lady. She smiled back and said,\" Hello, Karmen. I'm Kitty.\" Her voice was very strong for someone at her age. Later, I learned that she was   _   and had no   _   or  s to help her. From that day on, I often visited her and   _   her with her housework and sometimes she gave me some delicious   _  . A year passed, and I considered her to be one of my best friends.\nOne day, I walked over for my morning   _   and knocked on the door, but there was no   _  . I knocked again, and she didn't still turn up. So I let myself in, using the   _   she had given me. I checked her living room and then her kitchen. I finally went into her   bedroom  , and she was lying peacefully on her bed. Beside her there were two   _  . One was her will , which said all that she had would be given to me. The other was a thank-you note. I went to her bedside and cried   _  .\nThough several years has gone by, I still   _   her deeply. Whenever I look at the beautiful flowers in front of her house, I remembered the wonderful   _   we had.",
