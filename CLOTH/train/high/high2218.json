She thought she'd just  _  a shooting star. Less than thirty minutes later, that surprise turned to  _  .\n\"I was  _  walking through the park when I felt a tap on my  _  .\" Williams explained. As a result of being  _  , she started to run, thinking a stranger had appeared out of  _  . Then she heard something hit the ground behind her. \"The  _  was similar to an empty glass jar, \"  Williams recalled.   \" Then I  turned around  and found it looked like a piece of fabric   ,  _  it sounded like metal. \" Williams felt  _  that she was just fine.\nExcited by her  _  , she took the fallen piece of sky to her local library where she was advised to  _  the National Weather Service, who told her about  a rocket  that had entered the earth ' s atmosphere the night before.  After  _  what had happened,  Williams took the piece to the University of Tulsa where Dr Winton Cornell  _  it with an electron microscope.\n\"It had been partly  _  when flying down at high speed. It appeared to be the kind of material used t0  _  fuel tanks,\" Williams said. She then sent it to a research center, where they did further analysis  _  the material to be part of the fuel tank of a US spacecraft, the  _  0f which is to make sure fuel tanks can not be damaged easily. Lottie Williams has become perhaps the only person in history to ever get hit by falling space rubbish.",
