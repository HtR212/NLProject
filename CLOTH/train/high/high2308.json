    "article": "It was a normal summer night, humidity hung in the thick air. The only sound was my sister's heavy  _  from the bed next to me. I couldn't go to  _  , partly because of my cold and partly because of my  _  for the next day. My mum had said that tomorrow was going to be a  _  . Sweat stuck to my aching body. Finally, I gathered enough  _  to sit up. I looked out of my small window into the night. There was a big bright  _  hanging in the sky, giving off a magic glow. My sister turned over as though she was as light as air. Why could she sleep soundly? Why wasn't she  _  too? Did she know about tomorrow? I couldn't stand the  _  anymore, so I did what I always do to make myself feel better. I went to the  _  and picked up my toothbrush and toothpaste. Pouring the red paste onto the brush, I cleaned back and forth, up and down. Then I walked downstairs to look for some  _  of movement, some life. Gladiator, my cat,  _  me as he meowed his sad song. He was on the old orange couch , sitting up on his front legs,  waiting for  something to happen. He looked at me as if to say, \"I'm  _  , pet me. I need a good hug.\" Even the couch begged me to sit on it. In one movement I settled down onto the soft  _  . This couch represented my birth, my parents' marriage, and hundreds of other little  _  . As I held Gladiator, my heart started beating heavily. My mind was  _  with questions: What's life? Am I really alive? Are you listening to me? Every time I moved my hand down Gladiator's body, I had a  _  thought; each touch sang a different song. I forgot all about the  _  and the next day's surprise. The  _  was so full of warmth and silence that I sank into its arms. Falling asleep with the big cat in my arms, I felt all my worries  _  move away.",
