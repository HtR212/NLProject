    "article": "My wife Andrea and I picked a great time to move to New York City just a few days before the super storm Sandy hit the place.\nAlthough Sandy  _  my family to stay indoors for two days while the wind and rubbish swirled through my new neighborhood, it  _  some unusual opportunities for us to meet our  _  by serving them. Before the storm  _  , my family went for a walk. We knew we'd be closed up for a while. We should enjoy some  _  time while we could.\nWhile we were walking we noticed a woman  struggling with  a huge load of emergency supplies,   _  moving from the market to her  _  . She had three large piles of supplies. Each time she'd  _  15 or 20 feet with a pile, set it down, then go back and get another.\nThe  _  was going to hit before she got all of her supplies up to her living place.   _    we were already set, we figured it would be a good  _  to get to know a neighbor.\nSo Andrea and I each  _  a pile of supplies and helped the woman get  _  home. We had a good time getting familiar with her. She was from the Caribbean. Andrea and I loved  listening to  her thick, rich accent. When the storm hit later that night, we felt a little\nless  _  because we had a friend just a few buildings  _  . After Sandy there were dozens of  _   of selfless acts of service on TV, as people helped friends, neighbors and strangers in need.\n  _  others when you are in need of service yourself is a sign of greatness. As Luther King Jr. said, \"Everybody can be  _  , because anybody can serve.\"",
