It's time to turn off personal electronic devices when the plane's door  _  . However, there's always at least one person who keeps talking, texting, playing, watching or emailing -- and  _  strict orders to power down during flights. \"People have become so  _  to those devices, and a lot of people  _  whether they really need to turn them off,\" says an airhostess from Southwest Airlines. Is turning off the devices really  _  in the first place? Lots of passengers have doubted about the  _  of leaving devices on. They think one cell or message or game isn't going to  _  down the plane. Indeed, there's no  _  scientific evidence that having devices powered on during takeoff and landing would cause a  _  , only that there is the potential of a problem. In the US, pilots are allowed to use certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing, but if passengers'  _  devices are tested at the same time, it may lead to wrong warnings and  _  readings on the aircraft instruments. In some studies researchers found mobile phones could  _  global-positioning satellite systems or other aircraft systems. Though the effects are  _  slight, they could result in disaster.
