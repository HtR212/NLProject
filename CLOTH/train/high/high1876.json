Miss Ellen has another best friend,her  _  ,Imogene. Soon as her lights were off,I went into our kitchen and got a(n)  _  to say goodnight to Imogene. \"Imogene?\" I kept my voice  _  because Imogene is old and I didn't want to  _  her. Imogene looked at me  _  I put the egg under her. She seemed to  _  sitting on that egg. I guessed it must  _  her of good old times. Every morning,I went to Miss Ellen's home to  _  her bread while she ate Imogene's egg.\" I should let you eat the egg too,but it's Imogene's  _  to me,\"she said. When Imogene stopped laying eggs last year,Miss Ellen became  _  and quiet. That was before I started  _  giving her one of Mom's every night. One morning when I got to Miss Ellen's kitchen,something was  _  .Miss Ellen seldom allowed Imogene in the house,but that day she was on the table.

I looked at her in  _  .\"You knew?\" \"Yes. I'm sorry. To tell the truth,Imogene  _  that you come to visit her every day. She didn't want you to stop. So we decided to keep  _  .\" It took a minute for me to  _  .Then I figured it out. Both of them wanted me to come. I touched Imogene's head and smiled at Miss Ellen.",
