They will wonder how people could have been so 20 _ to use radioactive dyes in the nuclear imaging process. They will 21 _ my published research and think that I must have been a foolish doctor.\"\nHe further explained, \" 22 _ of the day can be the stupidity of tomorrow. The scholars who 23 _ my work today will be denied by the intellectuals of tomorrow. I am not 24 _ by their high regard of my 25 _ because I know a day will come in the future where we are all regarded as having been miserable 26 _ .\"\n\"Ever hear of a guy named Aristotle? In his day, he was considered to be a 27 _ . Of course, he also believed 28 _ in the concept that the sun revolved around the earth.
