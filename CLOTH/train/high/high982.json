    "article": "In the north of Scotland there is a lake called Loch Ness. It is the biggest  _  in Britain. It is over thirty kilometers  _  and in some places nearly 300 meters deep . It is cold and dark and not many people went there until after 1930. Then a road was made  _  the lake. Holiday makers began to use the road, and this was when the  _  began. Someone said that he had seen a monster in the lake. He said it was twelve meters long. It had a long  _  and a small head. Then someone else said he had seen  _  . Others said the same thing and in 1933 a London doctor took a  _  . It  _  like a monster with a long neck and a thick body but the photo was not too  _  . The newspapers printed the picture and  _  it the Loch Ness monster, or \"Nessie\". Then the argument began.  _  people, however, were certain there was something living in the lake. Others said there was  _  there. In 1961, a lot of people joined together to make a real  _  to see and photograph the monster to find  _  there was one! Several times people thought they saw something but after ten years there was  _  no hard evidence. Later underwater television cameras were used, but  no one  found any real proof . However, they  _  find something interesting: a huge underwater cave. It was big enough to be  _  of a monster, but of course, this was not a proof. In 1975, however, some American scientists  _  a search group. They used an underwater camera. It took pictures every seventy seconds. Some of the pictures seemed to show a red-brown creature. Its body was about four meters long  _  had a very ugly head on the end of a four -meter neck. Many people then began to believe in the monster. But even today we can't be certain.",
