The recent  _  Ant Tribes about the life of some young people  _  flock to Beijing after  _  university,describes the graduates,like ants,as smart but  _  as individuals,drawing strength from living together in communities.

The book's chief editor,Lian Sir,tells that piece of statistic says  _  about the real situation for many of these graduates.\"I am always  _  how many of these employed college graduates are leading a happy life,\" Lian said.\"I hope this book could offer a window on these graduates,whose stories are  _  known.\" The setting of the book is several so-called \"settlement villages for college students\" in the outskirts of Beijing,where a large  _  of college graduates  _  .Most of these graduates work for  _  or medium-sized businesses,  _  less than 2,000 Yuan a month.They live together because it's  _  The rent in these communities is only around 350 Yuan a month.Many of them travel several hours a day for short-term jobs or job interviews. Tangjialing,a small  _  20 kilometers from Tian'anmen Square,has around 3,000  _  villagers,but has become a  _  for more than 50,000 migrants ,most of whom  _  from universities or colleges all over the country.Lian describes the students'  _  as five or six-storey buildings built by local farmers with 12 rooms on each floor and two or three people crammed together in each room of about 10 square meters.Up to 70 or 80 people share the same toilet and kitchen.",
