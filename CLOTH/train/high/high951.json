She looked at me and said, \"I want you to  _  this two - dollar bill for extra good luck.\" \"Thanks, Mom,\" I replied. \"I will keep it close  _  me always.\" My mother passed away when I was 17 years old and I remembered  taking out  my two -- dollar bill, holding it in my hand for the longest time and I knew she would be  _  me the rest of my life. On my first  _  , I was thirty years old. As I sat in the  waiting room  , I noticed there were five women ahead of me. All of them were  _  and well dressed, which made me more nervous. \"What makes you feel you are  _  for this job?\" Mrs. Martin, the office manager asked me. \"I really need this job and there is  _  I can't do. I know I am not as  _  as your other applicants for the job, but please give me a  _  . I learn quickly and can be a very capable  _  of your team.\" That evening I received a(n)  _  from Mrs. Martin. \"Gina,\" she said, \" you were not the most suitable  _  , but you have so much confidence in yourself  _  we decided to give you a chance to prove yourself.\" \"Thank you, Mrs. Martin. You will not regret this  _  ,\" I said excitedly and  hung up  the phone. I got my  _  and took out my two -- dollar bill. \"Thanks, Mom. I am sure to  _  it,\" I said out loudly so that she could hear me.",
