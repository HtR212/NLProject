    "article": "Like any good mother, when Karen found out that another baby was on the way, she did what she could to help her three-year-old son, Michael, prepare for a new baby. They found out that it was going to be a girl, and day after day, night after night, Michael  _  to his sister in Mommy's tummy .He was building a bond of love with his little sister before he even met her. The pregnancy progressed  _  for Karen. In time, the labor pains came. Soon it was every five minutes ... every minute. But something serious  _  during delivery. Finally, Michael's little sister was born. But she was in serious  _  . With siren howling in the night, the ambulance  _  the infant to the Intensive Care unit at St. Mary's Hospital in Knoxville, Tennessee.  The days  inched by. The little girl got worse. The doctors told the parents, \"There is very little hope.\" Karen and her husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot. They had  fixed up  a special room in their home for the new baby -- now they planned a funeral. After two weeks in Intensive Care, it looked as if a funeral would come  _  the week was over. Michael, kept begging his parents to let him see his sister, \"I want to sing to her,\" he said. Kids were never  _  in Intensive Care. But Karen made up her mind to take Michael  whether  they liked it or not. If he didn't see his sister now, he may never see her alive. She  _  him in an oversized suit and  _  him into ICU. He looked like a walking laundry basket, but the head nurse  _  him as a child, \"Get that kid out of here now!\" The mother rose up strong in Karen, and the usually  _  lady glared steel-eyed right into the head nurse's face, saying in a  _  tone of voice, \"He is not leaving until he sings to his sister!\" Karen towed Michael to his sister's bedside. He gazed at the tiny baby  losing  the battle to live. And he began to sing.  _  the pure hearted voice of a 3-year-old, Michael sang: \"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are gray...\"  _  the baby girl responded. The pulse rate began to  _  down and became steady. \"Keep on singing, Michael.\" encouraged Karen. \"You never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away...\"As Michael sang to his sister, the baby's breath became as smooth as a kitten's purr. \"Keep on singing, Michael.\" \"The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping...\" Michael's little sister relaxed as rest, healing rest, seemed to sweep over her. Funeral plans were  _  . The next day -- the very next day -- the little girl was well enough to go home! The medical staff just called it a miracle. Karen called it a miracle of God's love!",
