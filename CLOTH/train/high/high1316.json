    "article": "I looked at my beautiful Christmas tree and sighed. The New Year was a week old and my tree  _  stood in the corner of our room with its collection of memories proudly  _  in a shower of colorful lights. I'd  _  long enough.\nI got up, went to the  _  and dragged the boxes into the room. The garland   was the first to  come down  . I took the large ornaments   off next. They  _  a large pile on our bed. An hour later, our bed was covered with Christmas memories.\nI prepared the boxes and  _  placed ornaments in their protective packaging, pausing every few minutes to  _  a favorite. \"Hey, little Santa!\" I held the Santa from my childhood. \"Thanks for being my friend for almost fifty years.\" He was a little  _  but still gives me a flood of wonderful memories.\nThere was a collection of handmade ones my children made in their first years of school more than twenty years ago. They are  far from  perfect in design, but every year they go on my memory tree.\nA few hours after I started, the  _  boxes were back in the garage, the room was  _  and I sat staring at the corner. It took me two days of work to  _  my tree, but only a few hours to take it apart.\nMy tree is a good marriage or a great friendship.  Similar to  the tree, they take a long time to decorate with memories, but can be torn down  _  .What once stood proudly in the glow of love comes tumbling down and all it  _  is an unkind word or a thoughtless act.\nEvery year I have to put my tree away, but not my marriage or friendships. They get to glow in the corner of my life for  as long as  I live. I get to analyze my tree and find memories for a few weeks every year. I can do the same with the loves in my life every day. When I held the Santa, a flood of wonderful memories  _  . The same happens when I hold my wife or see the smile of a friend across the room.\n  _  your friendships and your marriage. Once they come down, they aren't as easy to put back together as a Christmas tree, if  at all  . Stand them in that special spot in the corner of your heart and admire their glow.",
