I was not a bad student,but I just didn't understand  _  they were teaching because I have a learning  _  . I wanted to show everyone I could graduate and go to  _  . I wanted to make something of myself, and  _  I wasn't a failure.  _  the time came to choose a college, I wasn't sure which would be the best for me. I knew I didn't  _  to go to a big school, which narrowed my  _  to a small college which could be  _  for me with a learning disability. I looked in Florida and found three schools.

After a two-day drive, we arrived. \"Welcome to Beacon College! It is so nice to see you!\" I heard  over and over  from the teachers and students, as we were introduced. I felt so  _  to hear those cheerful voices. I knew I had found a perfect school. I had found my home for the next four years.",
