I'd  _  five million people could have  _  me in the pole vault   the years I won it, at  _  five million. Men who were stronger and faster than I was could have done it, but they never  picked up  a pole, never made the  _  to pick their legs off the ground to try to get over the bar.\nGreatness is all  _  us. It's easy to be great because great people will help you. What is fantastic about all the conventions I go to is  _  the greatest in the business will come and share their ideas, their methods and their  _  with everyone else. I have seen the greatest men open up and show young people exactly how they did it. They don't  hold back  .\nI'll never forget the time I was  _  to break Dutch Warmer Dam's record. I was about a foot  _  his record, so I called him on the phone. I said, \"Dutch, can you  _  me? I seem to have leveled off. I can't get any higher.\"\nHe said, \"  _  , Bob, come to visit me and I'll give you all I got.\" I  _  three days with the master, the greatest pole vaulter in the world. For three days, Dutch gave me  _  that he'd seen. To make a long  _  short, I went up eight inches. That great guy gave me the best that he had. I've found that sports champions and heroes  _  do this just to help you become great, too.\nGreat people will share and will tell you their  _  . Look for them, call them on the phone or buy their books. Go  _  they are, get around them, and talk to them. It is  _  to be great when you get around great people.",
