So I wrote to the host of the  _  , cartoonist Jack Cassady, asking for advice on entering the profession . Two weeks later I got a (n)  _  letter from Jack, answering my questions about materials and process . He also  _  me not to get discouraged if I was refused  at first  . He said the cartoon samples I sent him were good and worthy of publication . I got very  _  , finally understanding how the whole process  _  . I sent my best cartoons to and ,  _  the magazines rejected me immediately. Discouraged, I put my art supplies in the box and  _  to forget all about cartooning. To my  _  , in June 1987 I got another letter from Jack, although I hadn't even  _  him for the former advice. Here's what he said: Dear Scott, I was reviewing my \"Funny Business\" mail file when I again came  _  your letter and your cartoons. I remember answering you letter. I'm writing to encourage you to submit your ideas to various publications again. I hope you have  _  done so and are making progress and having some  _  too. Sometimes encouragement in the funny business is hard to come by. That's  _  I am encouraging you to hang in there and keep drawing. I wish you good luck. Sincerely, Jack I was deeply  _  because Jack had nothing to gain--including my thanks. I acted on his  _  , took out my art supplies and inked the sample strips that  _  became . I feel  _  that I wouldn't have tried cartooning again if Jack hadn't sent the second letter. As became more successful I came to  _  Jack's simple act of kindness.",
