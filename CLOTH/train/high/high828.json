I was in the kitchen when  the nursing home  called and told me to make a quick decision .They could only hold a place for my  _  until the next morning. The thought of being  _  from my Alzheimer's stricken mother when she needed me most  _  me .Dad died when I was a teenager ,Mom and I had  _  many hard times together .Mom taught me to laugh my way through bad experiences and sing through  _  days .But in recent years , except for extremely  _  moments of consciousness , she'd become lost in her own private world .I knew that Mom needed  _  nursing and medical care ,yet the possibility of a complete stranger coming to her at night ,when she would  _  around like a sleepwalking child ,filled me with a feeling of  _  . Two bitter days passed  _  we left for the nursing home .I hugged and kissed her with  _  tears ,I'd always planned the best golden years for Mom in her old age ,but now I was saying  _  . Suddenly there was something shining in her  _  a look of recognition .\"Stop crying now\",she said firmly ,\"Say goodbye and get going .Don't  _  about me .\" I stood with  _  and stared into her face .\"Mom!\"I cried and reached out for her .But as quickly as my \"real \"Mom had appeared ,she  _  again into her world of a little child .  _  ,at that very moment I realized the mother ,that familiar Mom who knew and understood ,who  _  and sang with me in hard times ,would always be there , giving me  _  when I needed it most .",
