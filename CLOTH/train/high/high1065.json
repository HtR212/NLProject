    "article": "They say after a parent dies, the surviving children can take on some of their parent's characteristics. I  _  becoming anything like my dad for years  _  I wanted to be me, not him; but there I sat at his memorial service several months ago, telling myself, \" You've  _  a lot more of your dad in you than you think.\"\nThere is this phrase my dad  _  and I know I'm going to sound  _  to complain about it, but it used to  _  me. \" I am so proud of you,\" he told us kids, whether we'd won a race or helped others. That should be a (n)  _  thing, but here's what always  went through  my mind: \" You are taking credit for what isn't really yours. You can be proud, but the  _  is mine.\nYour parent is doing his best to give you  _  , but you do not  _  it. \" I'm so proud of you.\" It came out of my dad's mouth  all the time  , on those calls where I might have   _  something that happened at work or when he and Mom came to visit and we  showed off  the talents of our two boys. I knew the feeling of parental  _  well, especially when my boys achieved in ways that were  _  my comprehension and ability, but I looked for other ways to  _  it. \" That's an extremely good story you've written!\" I would say about the composition. I thought that by making my praise  _  , it would feel like I was claiming their achievement less as mine and more as one they could own themselves.\nSo just the other day when my older son sent me an email about his scholarship, I searched for  _  things to say, but finally  _  he doesn't need my cleverness. They just want what my dad gave me. \" I'm so proud of you,\" I wrote. Just like the old man to me.",
