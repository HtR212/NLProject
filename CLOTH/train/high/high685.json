In one of my earlier   _  , my mother was telling me \"Don't watch the   _   when you say, 'I'm sorry'. Hold your head up and look at the person in the   _  , so he'll know you 40 _  it.\"\nMy mother thus made the key point of a(n) 41 _  apology: It must be direct. You must never 42 _  to be doing something else. You do not 43 look through  a pile of letters while apologizing to a person 44 _   in position after blaming him or her for a mistake that turned out to be your 45 _ . You do not apologize to a hostess, whose guest of honor you treat 46 _ , by sending flowers the next day without mentioning your bad 47 _ .\nOne of the important things we should do for an 48 _  apology is a readiness to 49 _  the responsibility for our careless mistakes. We are used to making excuses, which leaves no 50 _  for the other person to 51 _  us. Since most people are open-hearted, the no-excuse apology leaves both parties feeling 52 _  about themselves. That, after all, is the 53 _  of every apology. It 54 _  little whether the apologizer is wholly or only partly at fault. Being responsible for one's 55 _  encourages others to take their share of the blame.",
