    "article": "A young and successful executive was driving along a neighborhood street, going a bit too fast. He was watching for kids playing between parked cars and  _  down when he thought he saw something.\n  _  his car passed, one child appeared, and a brick  _  onto the car's side door. He braked his car and backed to the spot from  _  the brick had been thrown.\nHe  _  out of the car, grabbed some kid and  _  him up against a parked car, shouting, \"What was that all about \"Just what are you doing?\"he  worked on  \"That's a new car and that brick you threw is going to  _  lot of money. Why did you do it?\"\"Please, mister, Please, I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do!\"  _  he youngster. \"It's my brother,\"he said. \"He  _  off the step and fell out of his  _  and I can't lift him up.\"Sobbing, the boy asked the executive, \"Would you please  _   me get him back? He's hurt and he's too  _  for me.\"\n  _  by the words , he lifted the young man back into the wheelchair and took out his handkerchief and wiped the cuts,  _  to see that everything was going to be okay.\n\"Thank you, sir. And God bless you,\"the  _  child said to him. The man then watched the little\nboy  _  his brother to the sidewalk toward their home. It was a long walk  _  to his car, a long slow walk. He never did repair the side door. He kept the mark to  _  him not to go through life so fast that  _  has to throw a brick at you to get your attention.",
