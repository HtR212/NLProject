But for those who are not that sporty, nothing could be nicer than having a  _  afternoon tea with a few good friends and taking a break from studying. But are you  _  with the culture of afternoon tea----its origins, what's  _  , and the proper etiquette ? While the tradition of drinking tea  _  back to more than 3,000 B.C. in China, it was not until the mid 17th century that the  _  of \"afternoon tea\" first appeared in the U.K. In 1840,Anna Maria Russell, the seventh Duchess of Bedford, started  asking for  a tea tray with butter, bread and cakes at 4 p.m. every day, as she found she was  _  at this time and the evening meal in her household was  _  fashionably late at 8 p.m. She found this new habit difficult to  _  and soon invited other ladies in society to join her. This  _  for tea quickly became a fashionable social event. During the 1880s, women of  _  class and society would  change into  long gowns, gloves and hats for their afternoon tea. Traditional afternoon tea, typically served  _  4 p.m. and 6 p.m., is technically a small meal, not a drink. It  _  of a selection of sandwiches, freshly baked scones served with cream and fruit jam, pastries and cakes. Of course, tea or coffee, served with milk and sugar, is also provided. Nowadays, you can enjoy a traditional yet fancy afternoon tea with pot-brewed tea and delicate snacks in many restaurants and hotels. But in the  _  home, afternoon tea is  _  to be much simpler-biscuits with a mug of tea, usually produced by using a teabag.  _  definition, afternoon tea is a dainty meal. So, when you drink you tea, take small sips  rather than  \"glugging\" it down. There's a definite order to taking tea, but the actual drinking of tea can take place throughout the \"meal\".  _  , the good served should be consumed in a restrained fashion as well. Sandwiches are eaten first,  _  by the sweet snacks, such as cakes, pastries and scones.",
