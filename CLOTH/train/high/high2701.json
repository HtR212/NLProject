    "article": "It was a cold winter morning. Half asleep at the train station, I stared into the distance,  _  for the train to take me to my  _  in Boston. The word was quiet. The very few people on the street kept to themselves,  _  their steaming cups of coffee. Reaching into my pocket as the  _  was approaching, my numb hand searched for the $ 20 bill to pay my fare. The pocket was  _  ! I searched through my bag and then I felt  _  . Unless the money dropped from the sky, I'd be  _  there. \"What's the matter?\" A short, elderly man stood before me. \"Oh, nothing.... Well, I  _  my money and now I can't pay for the ticket. I'm going to  _  my match class, and the train is leaving.\" \"Here, use this.\" The man held a $ 20 bill. I looked up,  _  . People just didn't do that anymore. Everyone worried about their own  _  , rarely stopping to think about others, especially teenage strangers. \"Thank you, but no, I can't.\" \"  _  it - go!\" The man pushed me  _  the train. I bought a round - trip ticket, and he refused the change I  _  to give him back. I did not know what to say - a million thoughts raced through my mind, yet I stood  _  . For the train ride I was silent. I began to see the world through  _  eyes. That man made a difference with such a simple  _  . A week later I was at the train station again, with an extra $ 20  in case  I saw the man. And there he was. \"excuse me, sir, I believe I owe you this.\" I  _  the money into his hand. Failing to refuse, he said, \"Just remember to do the same for someone in your shoes someday.\" I smiled, content. The elderly man is my hero. For many, heroes are famous, but my hero is a  _  stranger who taught me a lesson in life. I will never forget his kindness.",
