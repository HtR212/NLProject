The largest kind of sea turtle can grow as long as eight feet and  _  1,500 pounds. Even the smallest kind, Kemp's-Ridley, can  grow up  to 28 inches long and weigh almost 100 pounds. Many other turtles are small enough to  _  in your hand. It is difficult to find population numbers for sea turtles because they do not  return to  shore once they hatch and reach the ocean, which makes it hard to  keep track of  them. Sea turtles  _  in the water because they are safer there. They cannot  _  their heads and feet into their shells like other turtles can. Sea turtles cannot hide inside their shells  _  other animals that want to eat them. They need to move quickly to stay safe. When the weather  _  warm, sea turtles leave the ocean to  _  their eggs on the beach. This is the only time they will ever leave the water. Most  other  turtles spend part of the time in water  _  part of the time on land. It is easy to understand  _  sea turtles stay in the water. Their  _  to swim is greater than their ability to walk. Their heavy bodies and unusual feet make it hard for them to  _  on land. They are better  _  for life in the water. They are well suited for life in the sea because of  the way  their bodies are made. The way their feet are made helps sea turtles swim very quickly. Their feet look like long  _  . When they swim, they flap their feet like a bird flaps its wings. This  _  way of swimming benefits sea turtles. It allows them to escape from their enemies.",
