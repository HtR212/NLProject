At that time, a wall of water swept in and tore the ground floor apart underneath us.  _  to be moved out to Colombo was very frightening because everyone was afraid that another and possibly bigger  _  would come. At one stage we heard that another wave was coming and there was  _  . Surprisingly, a fleet of small vehicles driven by local people arrived outside the hotel and we just  jumped into  a minibus. We were taken up a hill to a place of  _  where we were welcomed by a family who told us that we could stay as  _  as we needed to. Among all this death and  _  , these people were trying to help us! We were shown to the local Mosque where hundreds of locals were cooking, collecting and distributing food and supplies for those less  _  . In the three days we were waiting to leave, we saw many examples of ordinary Sri Lankans, many of whom had lost friends,  _  and livelihoods(,), trying to help others who were worse off. It was a very moving experience. We have since been  in contact with  the family who took us in and they are saying that what their country needs most urgently is practical help, doctors, nurses and medicines, helping to  _  roads and rebuilding electricity and water supplies. These people would have done anything to help us, it is time for the British Government to do more to help them.",
