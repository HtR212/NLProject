So he  _  the artist to work on one of the walls. At the same time, another artist came and asked to work on the  _  wall. He promised he would make the same picture as the first artist's  _  looking at the first artist's work. The second artist asked to have a thick curtain  put up  between the two walls  so that  neither of them could see each other. The following day they began to work. The first artist brought in a(n)  _  supply of paint, oil, water and so on. The second one came with a  _  and a bucket . A month later, the first artist's work was completed, and the second artist said, \"My wall is  _  too!\" The king went to  _  the first artist's wall. He was pleased with it and gave the artist a large  _  of money. He then asked people to open the curtain.  _  ! Each line was  _  the same as that on the opposite wall. The king was quite satisfied and gave him double money. However, he  _  how the second man had made it. \"I just  _  the wall with the cloth,\" the man said  _  .The wall was made of white marble .

If you are happy, the world will be happy.",
