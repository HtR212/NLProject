The assignment was to \"go to someone you love  _  the next week and tell them you love them.It  has to  to be someone you have never  _  those words to before or at least haven't shared those words with for a long time.\" That doesn't  _  like a very tough assignment,  _  you stop to realize that most of the men were over 35 and were  _  .\" Showing feelings or crying (heaven forbid!) was just not done  _  this was a very threatening assignment for some. At the  _  of our next class, I asked if someone wanted to  _  what happened when they told someone they loved them.I fully expected one of the  _  to volunteer, as was usually the  _  , but on this evening one of the men raised his hand.He appeared quite moved and a bit  _  .As he unfolded out of his chair, he began by saying, \"Dennis.I was quite  _  with you last week when you gave us the assignment.I didn't think that I had  _  to say those words to and  _  , who were you to tell me to do something that personal? But as I began driving home my conscience started talking to me.It was telling me that I  _  exactly who I needed to say I love you to.You see, five years ago, my father and I had a heated  _  and really never resolved it since that one.We  _  seeing each other unless we absolutely had to at Christmas or other family gatherings.But  _  then, we hardly spoke to each other.So last.Tuesday  by the time  I got home, I had convinced myself.I was going to tell my father I loved him.\"",
