He had   _  twenty dollars.\n     The third Saturday in December, Mark said he had   _  his list and had his money in his  _  . I drove him to a  _  supermarket. Mark picked up\na hand basket and went off on his own  _  I waited patiently\nreading a book at the front of the store. It  _  Mark over 45\nminutes to choose his presents. When he came up to the checkout  , the smile on his face was truly   _  . The clerk rang up his purchase as I  _  looked at\nthe other way. Mark kept  within  his budget   and   reached  into his\npocket for his money.  _  was not there! There was a hole in\nhis pocket, but no money. Mark stood  in the middle of  the store holding\nhis basket, with tears rolling down his cheeks. His whole body was  _  with\nhis sobs  . Then a(n)   _  thing\nhappened. A  _  shopping in the store came up to Mark. She\nknelt down and took him  _  her arms. \"You would do me the\nfavor if you let me  _  your money,\" said the woman. \"It\nwould be the most wonderful present you could ever give me. I only ask you\ncould  pass it on  . One day, when you grow up, I would like you to\nfind someone you can help. I know you feel as good about it  _  I\ndo now when you do help other people.\" Mark took the money, tried to dry his  _  and ran to the checkout as fast as he could.",
