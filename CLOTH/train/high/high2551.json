    "article": "It was very cold at 7 am that Monday morning in Harvard Square. I was nearly mad because I had just  _  the bus, and was standing out in the freezing cold waiting for the next one. My mind was filled with anxiety and  _  thoughts. \"Why didn't I leave two minutes  _  ?\"  _  the others at the bus stop was a woman in her fifties wearing a old-fashioned hat, an old pair of boots and a dark coat, but she had no  _  . Another woman, who looked to be in her middle twenties, said to the  _  woman, \"Your hands must be very cold. You'll get frostbitten in this weather.\" She  _  her heavy backpack to the ground, bent down, and began  _  for something inside her backpack. The older woman looked  _  and said, \"Oh no, that's OK. I'm  _  . The younger woman continued to search  _  in her backpack and the older woman kept repeating, \"Don't  _  yourself. I'll be all right.\" After  _  seemed like so many minutes, the younger woman  pulled out  a pair of purple gloves. She took the older woman's hands and gently  _  a glove on each hand, covering one finger  at a time  . The older woman said, \"Thank you. You're so sweet.\" Though I was very cold, the act of  _  gave ma a warm feeling inside. It also motivated me to buy five pairs of purple gloves, similar to hers, and  _  them in my bag, just in case I  came across  someone who was in great  _  on a cold day.",
