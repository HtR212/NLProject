    "article": "Do you ever feel like you are studying a mad rush of one subject after another? When things happen at such a  _  pace, it is easy to lose sight of what you are learning. It is important to  _  every now and then to think about what you have been learning.\nSelf reflection means stopping the mad rush and  _  yourself so that your brain can  evaluate what it has already  _  .Some people prefer to do their self reflections  _  , while  others keep a journal. Either method can work, depending on what your own personal  _  is.\nSchool textbooks are often divided into units. This can make it  _  for someone to begin the process of self reflection. Watch for the times when you complete a unit of study. Sometimes you are reminded that the unit is   _  because there is some kind of test or quiz. Use these natural  _  as opportunities to stop and reflect.\nYou should find a  _  place---anywhere without noise is OK. This can even be sitting at your desk at school when you finish something  _  and the other students are still working. If you are going to take notes, take out your journal Write down some notes on things that you  _  learned in this unit. Let your mind think about the notes you have written and make some  _  .\nSometimes just pausing to think deeply allows your brain to make connections   so that  new information can quickly appear when you  _  it again. Next, think about things that you still wonder about.  For example  , maybe you learned about a certain body system, but you don't  _  how it works with the other body systems. Maybe you learned a new way to solve a math problem, but you are not sure when to use it. Writing down your  _  will help you remember to continue seeking answers the next time your  come across  the same topic.\nSelf reflection is an essential skill for a  _  student. If you have never taken the time to reflect, try it now.",
