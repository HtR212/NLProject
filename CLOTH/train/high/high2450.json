    "article": "The day for the great balloon competition finally arrived. Every insect in the garden had been    _   hard, and now they were preparing to begin their routines. The balloon competitions were always something really special. \nEach time, the flying insects were favourite   _   to win, because they could seize the balloon strings and fly off in all directions, creating all sorts of  58 _   in the air.   _   , on this occasion there were some rather unusual insects taking part: a group of ants. Of course,   _    expected that they could do anything special. They were so light that no ant had ever   _   to take part, but it was quite impressive to see all the ants all   _    organized and prepared. \nSo the competition began, and the    _   insects took their turns, performing beautiful movements with the balloons. As always, the butterflies left everyone    _    with their twist and turns, and their wonderful colours. When it was time for the ants to perform, it seemed like the competition had already been decided. \nFor the    _   time in living memory, the ants shared just one balloon between them, and one by one they climbed up the balloon string,  66 _  a thin black thread of ants. When all the string was covered, the last ant climbed    _    his teammates to reach the balloon.   _  he got there, he climbed onto the top of the balloon. \nThis strange    _    attracted everyone's curiosity, and they were just about to witness the most important    _   : the ant opened his jaws as wide as he could. . . and then he made a violent movement at the balloon with all his strength!\nThe result was powerful! The balloon began blowing out its air, flying    _   about, here and there, doing a thousand turns and spins, while the ants made all kinds of beautiful shapes out of the string. \nOf course, that acrobatic  flight    _    with quite a hard landing, but it didn't    _  . The creativity and teamwork of the ant performance was so   _    that the crowd didn't even have to vote for there to be a winner. \nFrom then on, in that garden, everyone understood how much could be achieved by working   _  . In the years to come, the balloon competitions were full of displays carried out by teams, and they put on some wonderful routines; something those individual insects could never have achieved on their own.",
