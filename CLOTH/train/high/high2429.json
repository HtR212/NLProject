I was busy trying to  find out  which way we went next when my brother pulled over and asked the guy if he needed any  _  . And he did. He had a flat tire and needed a wrench  to get it off.\nMy brother  _  him a wrench, and then began to help him  _  the tire. The young man said that this had been a  _  week for him; earlier he had gotten into a minor car accident, and now this  _  flat on his way home from work. But he called us \"breath of fresh air\", and kept  _  us because he really would have been stuck  _  we hadn't come along.\nAfter we had finished the job he thanked us  _  and pulled out $20 and  _  to give it to us. \"No,\" my brother said. \"We were  _  supposed to get on that bridge. Yet we took a wrong turn. But now we know  _  we did. It was to help you.
