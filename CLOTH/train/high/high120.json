    "article": "My parents passed away ten years ago and I miss them terribly. But I know they are with me every day in what they taught me and in the   _   they gave me. Every morning my father's message to me was: \"Remember that   _   you walk out of this door, you carry responsibility, the good name of this family, the hopes and dreams of your mom and dad. My mother often urged me to   live up to   the high standards she set for me.\"\nWhen I was in high school, I played in a rock band with friends in my class. We were devoted and practiced constantly. We moved past the guys-in-a-garage stage and   _   to be pretty good, doing getting-paid gigs   most weekends, which made me   _  . At that time, though part of me was   _  up in that band, another part of me was the oldest son in the Clark family,   _  of my origin and a dedicated student busy applying to colleges. Without even telling my parents, I applied to Harvard. I didn't think I had much chance of getting in,   _   I wanted to try. So I was riding around being Mr Cool Rock Musician half of the time, and the other half I was focused on family and   _   goals. I was running on parallel   _  .\nWhen the group won a city wide Battle of the Bands, things heated up. My bandmates had stars in their eyes - we might be able to make it big. However, I began to feel   _  . I realized I was on quite different tracks: I   _   was becoming two people,   _   identities back and forth depending on who I was with. I had to make an option. As I considered my   _  , my parents' words were right there, helping me to see that my dreams weren't about signing a record deal, letting my hair grow, and living in a tour bus. So I   _   out. My bandmasters were   _  . They thought I was crazy to withdraw   _   the peak of real success. But however successful that band got, I knew it wasn't in line with my   _  , with my feeling of what I was   _   to do, with who I was - it simply wasn't me.\nIn that instant and in many others throughout my life, my parent's advice has helped me recenter and   _  . I could remember who I was - the hopes and dreams I carried.",
