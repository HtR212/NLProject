    "article": "I met Billy the last summer before college. He was handsome and his irreverence was  _  to me. We liked each other the first instant we met.  _  , I was a straight A student and my parents had high hopes for me to  _  an Ivy League school. Billy did not concentrate all his attention  _  his study and school life. However, we were in love --- so  _  teenager love. I still remember we had a plan for prom . It was understood that we had  _  about where we would dance and drink and party together. This meant one thing to my parents---panic. And it grew as the  _  letters began to roll in. Of the eleven schools I applied to, nine accepted me. And one of them was Brown University---the Ivy League  _  in 1770 in historic Providence, Rhode Island. There was no  _  that I was drawn to Brown, but Billy (who had joined the army) was  _  down south and I had offers  _  for me there, too. I was torn between my love for him and my family  _  . One week  _  the start of school, my mother had a talk with me. She said I was eighteen years old and I had a  _  to make--- one that went  _  beyond the choice of  _  to attend university. In August, I  packed up  and drove north to Providence. It took several months to  _  that my life was moving on in a way that was completely different from Billy's. Brown changed my life, opening doors and giving me the  _  I now use to think, to learn and to write. Life is always about  _  it seems, and the older I get, the more I understand this. Still, there are times when I think of Billy because he taught me about love.",
