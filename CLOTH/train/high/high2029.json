    "article": "We always celebrated my Dad's November birthday on Thanksgiving Day, even after he entered a nursing home. As years went on, these events took on a(n)  _  meaning - a traditional birthday party for Dad, and a personal  _  for all that he had done for me in my life. When we knew that it might be Dad's  _  birthday, the whole family decided to come together for a huge birthday celebration at the nursing home. It was a crowded party  _  all of us sitting around him. Dad was a wonderful  _  , and here was a biggest audience he'd ever had. During a quiet moment, I announced that it was now Dad's turn to  listen to  stories from us. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him.  One after another  , we told stories from our hearts,  _  Dad listened with wet, flashing blue eyes. We  _  all kinds of lost memories - stories about when we were little, stories about when Dad was young and stories that are shared as family  _  . Even the littlest grandchildren couldn't  _  to tell their grandfather why they loved him. For a man who had been kind to so many people in his life, here was our  _  to honor him. A few months later, at Dad's memorial service, we fully realized what we had given Dad that night. Those were the stories people normally tell at a  _  . They are told, then, full of tears, with the hope that the departed will somehow hear the outpouring of love.  _  we had given those loving  _  to Dad when he was  _  , told through laughter, accompanied by hugs and joy. I'm sure the stories and memories  _  over in his mind during his last months and days. Words do  _  , and they are enough. We need to say them, to speak them  _  to the ones we love, for everyone else to hear. That's the way to  give back  love, and our chance to honor a person in life.",
