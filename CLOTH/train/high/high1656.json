We were sitting in an elegant restaurant that had a small but lively  _  . When it played a familiar waltz tune I decided to  _  my father for a dance. \"Dad, you know I've never  _  with you before. I begged you but you  _  wanted to. How about right now?\" I waited for the  _  refusal. But instead, he considered thoughtfully and then said, \"Let's hit the floor and I'll  _  you just what kind of moves an old guy like me can still make.\" My father took me in his  _  and I felt overcome by emotion. As we danced I looked up at my father carefully but he  _  my eyes. \"Dad,\" I finally  _  , tears in my eyes, \"Why is it so hard for you to look at me?\" At last his eyes dropped to my face. \"  _  I love you so much.\" he whispered back. I was struck dumb by his  _  . It wasn't what I had thought. But it was of course exactly what I needed to  _  . I had always known that he loved me. I just hadn't understood that his vast emotion had  _  him and made him silent. \"I love you too, Dad!\" I whispered back softly. He stumbled over the next few words: \"I'm sorry that I'm not open. It's  _  for me, but just remember how much I love you.\" When the dance ended I excused myself to the ladies' room and during my absence  _  changed. When I came back, Dad sat in his chair  _  his body leaning forward, very pale. Everything was really too late. He was  _  . That night all I saw was his leaning body and pale face. But it's a totally different scene that I  _  now. I remember his saying \"I love you\" and my saying it back. The three words  _  on forever long after we are gone.",
