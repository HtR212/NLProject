    "article": "That morning, I got on the train as always. I was a publishing director and was reading my newspaper   as usual    . But that day, I read it very   _    . I thought I must be tired. At the office, I sat down, turned on my     _   and found I couldn't read the message on the screen. \nEventually, worried  _   drove me to hospital. There, confirmation came that I suffered from aphasia , a condition that  _   it's difficult or impossible to receive and produce language.\nI was back at home a week later, and my  _  was to get better and return to work in a couple of months. I started   _  a speech therapist  three times a week, and was given homework to help   _  my vocabulary and grammar. After a month, my own speech became   _  --\"Could you pass the salt?\" \"Shall we go for a walk?\" -- but I couldn't have a conversation. I couldn't read the newspaper.\nFor 25 years, I was used to a(n)   _   day of meetings, and bringing three manuscripts home with me each night. I didn't feel   _   to say goodbye to my old self. \nIn the darkest months, I devoted myself to  _    . I would spend hours writing a description of something   _   like a pencil. I couldn't   _  novels or newspapers, so I tried reading poetry, and found the shorter lines easier to   _  . My speech came back, and I learned how to read again,   _   much more slowly. I spent more time with my family, and   _  myself to slow down.\nNow, 10 years later, my relationship with my   _  is deeper than ever. We have  _   to be very patient with each other. I'm no longer a high-achieving publisher or someone who  _  10 books a week. I'm a family man with aphasia, and if I read 10 books a year, that's good.",
