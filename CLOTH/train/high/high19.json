    "article": "A woman in her sixties lived alone in her little cottage with a pear tree at her door. She spent all her time taking care of the tree. But the children nearby drove her  _  by making fun of her. They would climb her tree and then run away with pears,   _  \"Aunty Misery\" at her.\nOne evening, a passer-by asked to  _  for the night. Seeing that he had an  _  face, she let him in and gave him a nice   _  . The next morning the stranger, actually a sorcerer  , thanked her by granting   her  _  that anyone who climbed up her tree  _   not be able to come back down until she   _  it.\n  When the children came back to steal her  _  , she had them stuck on the tree. They had to beg her long  _  she gave the tree permission to let  _   go. Aunty Misery was free from the  _  at last.\nOne day another man   stopped at  her door. This one did not look trustworthy to her,   _  she asked who he was . \"I am Death, I've come to take you  _   me,\" said he.\nThinking fast Aunty Misery said, \"Fine, but I'd like to  _   some pears from my dear tree to remember the   _   it brought to me in this life. But I am too   _   to climb high to get the best fruit. Will you be so  _   as to do it for me?\" With a deep sigh, Mr. Death climbed up the tree  _  and was immediately stuck to it. No matter how much he warned or begged, Aunty Misery would not allow the tree to let Death go.",
