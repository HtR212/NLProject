You can also use other  _  when you choose your food. You may  _  it because it smells good or because it  _  good. You may dislike some types of food because they do not look, smell or taste very nice. Different  _  use different senses to find and choose their food. A few animals depend on only one of their senses, while most animals use more than one sense. Although there are many  _  types of food, some animals spend their lives eating only one type. The giant panda eats only one  _  type of bamboo. Other animals eat only one type of food even when given the  _  . A kind of white butterfly will stay on the leaves of a cabbage, even though there are plenty of other  _  in the garden. However, most animals have a more  _  diet. The bear eats fruits and fish. The fox eats small animals, birds and fruits. The  _  of these animals will be different depending on the season.  _  have a very varied diet. We often eat food because we like it and not because it is  _  for us. In countries such as France and Britain, people eat foods with too much  _  . This makes them overweight, which is bad for their health. Eating too much red meat and animal  _  , such as butter, can also be bad for the health.
