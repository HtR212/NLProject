The family were  _  every night at the dinner table. But the elderly grandfather's shaky hands and  _  sight made this rather difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped the glass,  _  would often spill onto the tablecloth. \"We must do something about grandfather,\" said the husband. So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, grandfather ate  _  in the corner while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner at the dinner table.  _  grandfather had already broken a dish or two, his food was served in a  _  bowl. Sometimes, when the family  glanced at  grandfather, he had a tear in his eye as he ate alone.  _  , the only words the couple had for him were sharp  _  when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The 4-year-old boy watched all this  in silence  . One evening before supper, the father  _  his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the child sweetly: \"What are you making?\" Just as  _  , the boy answered: \"Oh, I am making a little  _  for you and mama to eat your food from when I grow up.\" The 4-year-old boy smiled and went back to  _  on it. The words  _  the parents so much that they were  _  . Then tears started to stream down their cheeks.  _  no word was spoken, both knew what they had to do. That evening, the husband took grandfather's hand and  _  led him back to the family table.",
