    "article": "A friend of mine named Paul received an automobile from his brother as a Christmas present. On Christmas Eve when Paul  came out of  his office, a street urchin was walking around the shiny new car,  _  it. \"Is this your car, Mister?\" he said. Paul nodded, \"My brother gave it to me for Christmas.\" The boy was  _  , \"You mean your brother gave it to you and it didn't cost you anything? I wish...\" He  _  . Of course Paul knew what he was going to  wish for  . He was going to wish he had a brother like that. But what the boy said shocked Paul all the way  _  to his heels. \"I wish.\" the boy went on, \"that  _  could be a brother like that.\" Paul looked at the boy in  astonishment  , then impulsively he added, \"Would you like to take a  _  in my car?\" \"Oh yes, I'd love that.\" After a short ride, the boy  _  with his eyes shining, said, \"Mister, would you mind driving in front of  my house  ?\" Paul smiled a little. He thought the boy wanted to show his neighbors that he could ride home in a big automobile. But  _  Paul was wrong. \"Will you stop  where  those two steps are?\" the boy asked. He got out and  ran up  the steps. Then in a little while Paul heard him coming back slowly. He was  _  his little crippled brother. He sat him down on the bottom step, then sort of squeezed up against him and  pointed to  the car. \"  _  she is, Buddy, just like I told you upstairs.  Some day  I'm going to give you one just like it...then you can see for  yourself  all the pretty things in the Christmas windows that I've been trying to tell you about.\" Paul got out and lifted the crippled boy to the front seat of his car. The shining-eyed older brother climbed in beside him and the three of them began a memorable  _  ride. That Christmas Eve, Paul learned what Jesus meant when he said, \"It is more blessed to give.\"",
