    "article": "My brother and I were in Orlando Florida to witness our first Space Shuttle Launch. The Discovery was  _  to soar at 10:14 AM on a blue sky September day. I'd seen it  go up  so many times on television,  _  now I was only minutes away from seeing it launch. And it's the final demonstration of the  _  of success: Success Takes Off Like a Rocket. Witnessing the Take Off: Standing close to the Space Shuttle  _  home one unforgettable point--the Shuttle is the height of a 15-story building--it  _  4.5 million pounds--and NASA is trying to lift it 200 miles off the ground. On TV the accomplishments look so much  _  , so much easier. Crowds of people are standing around with you to watch the Shuttle go. The countdown begins through the small  _  of hundreds of portable radios all tuned to the NASA station. It's enough to get your heart beating  out of your chest  . When time is up, the side booster rockets are lit up and the eight explosive bolts  _  . The first things you see are large white  _  clouds exploding away. Through the steam, you see the fire power. Then the Space Shuttle begins to inch off the pad and climb its way  _  . Thousands upon millions of pounds of  _  can hardly lift the shuttle at all. But with ever increasing ease, the shuttle picks up and roars into the sky, headed into space attaining a  _  of over 17,000 mph. It is within the first two minutes to launch the Space Shuttle that the great success lesson is  _  . Fact: 85% of the shuttle's fuel is consumed within the first 2 minutes just to get the 15-story super structure to its orbital  _  . And that's exactly how success  takes off  : The first steps you take towards launching a successful career are the  _  and will require an enormous consumption of energy--a great big push. However,  _  you persist through the launch period, which can seem almost  _  for quite some time, everything gets easier and easier and your results get bigger and bigger.",
