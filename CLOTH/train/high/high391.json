    "article": "After spending a weekend away with my adult son, I was so impressed by his generous heart that I sent him this letter. Dear son, I want to thank you for teaching me a very valuable lesson in life by the great example you  _  . When we were eating at that cafe in Boston and a person who had  _  his hamburger didn't have enough money to pay for it, without  _  , you went over and  _  the extra $2 into his hand. When we were leaving, you  _  threw a five-cent coin onto the pavement and said something like, \"Some kid will really enjoy  finding  this.\" Last week, a young man  ahead of  me in the line at a petrol station didn't have  _  money to pay for his petrol. I asked the money collector, \"How much  _  is he?\" She told me he had meant to put $15 of petrol in his car  _  he had been looking at the wrong gauge and had put in 15  _  , which came to a little over $20. That is an easy mistake as both gauges run fast. Something made me think of you and  _  you did that night at the cafe in Boston. I handed the man $6. He was so  _  and said, \"But why would you do this for me?\" I just smiled as I thought of you. Thank you, son, for teaching me that \"it's  _  to give than to receive\". Now when I see a five-cent coin on the  _  and want to pick it up, I think of you and leave it there, just in case some kid will get a kick out of finding it. Love always, Mum.",
