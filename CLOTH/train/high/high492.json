It was  _  expensive for my family, and I always carried my lunch and brought the bag back home to  _  again the next day. You can understand my  _  when I had the opportunity to buy a hot lunch. Kids always  _  about the cafeteria food but I was very  _  of them. When we  _  lunch that day, Mrs Amatuli took me aside and said she wanted to  _  why she had bought my sandwiches. I really didn't care why,  _  it gave me a few minutes of her precious  _  so I was very quiet as she explained. You  _  , she was a Catholic and she told me that Catholics didn't eat red meat on Fridays--they ate  _  on Fridays. Oh, I couldn't  _  to get home and tell my Mom that from then on I wanted fish on Fridays.  _  my Mom understood why, she gladly fixed fish for me on Fridays. From then on, every Friday I could get in  _  with the rest of the kids for a hot lunch. I didn't care how many of the kids complained about the cafeteria food--it  _  great to me!
