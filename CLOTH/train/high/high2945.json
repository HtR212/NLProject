    "article": "Today I went to my daughter's school and spoke about kindness to 60 kids plus teachers and assistant teachers.  _  a small talk about the meaning of kindness, I gave a challenge to the  _  ----I told them to write a small  _  about an act of kindness that they had done and how that made them feel. Or if they had  _  an act of kindness, how did that make them feel? In what way had that   _  changed them? Then the vice head and the head-teacher and I would choose the ones, the best ones that will  stand out  for their feeling of compassion and love  _  others.\nWhen I was waiting for my daughter I  _  some teachers that were at the meeting passing by and I was  _  that they would tell me whether they liked the talk or not, but they didn't  _  anything.\nThen a little  _  came to me and said, \"You know, I enjoyed the meeting.\" \"Okay, then are you going to  _  a lovely story?\" I asked. \"I'm not  _  at writing,\" the boy responded. So I explained that I would be  _  if he could just write a phrase or two about an act of kindness.\nI didn't have  _  to talk to him because he was in a hurry to  _  his friends who were waiting for him, but in my  _  , that was a beautiful act of kindness. The fact that he was able to  _  to talk to me for two minutes, to let me know that he had   _   the meeting was worth all the effort I had  put into  into preparing the talk for them.",
