    "article": "It's been a year since I last saw my dad alive. He was chained to a  _  bed after months of neglect. His life came to a tragic end because our plant marijuana   is federally  _  . As he desperately fought to survive long enough for me to say  _  , I arrived at the hospital in time to hear his silent, lonely, painful soul  _  to me. I heard my dad's final message loud and clear.\nTo most people, we lost the first registered caregiver in Montana. To me, I lost my King and my best friend. His  _  has made me feel more spoiled than ever, bringing me the most  _  friends from the community! They've been keeping me  _  , helping me heal, and they wait with me for my mom to come home from prison. When I fall, they bring  _  into my life, wipe my tears and make it easy to get back up.\nI wish I could thank my dad for all the amazing people his death has brought me, and all his selfless  _  . If I could, I would especially thank him for all the pain and  _  that has led the best of the best fighters to me. I would thank him for standing  _  the food bank lines when I was a teenager and he was  _  and we were hungry. I would tell him how  _  I appreciate him for spoiling us with food when he had money and I would thank him for  _  to give back to the food banks! I'd hug him for going broke to buy me a(n)  _  and dryer when I was a young mom, so my kids and I didn't have to go to a dangerous laundry to wash clothes.\nI would  _  to him for encouraging me to stay in Girl Scouts  _  I was in the tenth grade, despite what friends said about me. That taught me not to  _  what other people think!\nMy dad didn't have much to  leave behind  because the Feds   stole everything, but his death has made me feel rich  _  his heart was filled with gold. My memories are priceless.",
