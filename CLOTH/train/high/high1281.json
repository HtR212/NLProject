Instead of pigs being treated as its   _  , love turns nature's enemies into friends.\nIn a zoo in California, a mother tiger gave birth to a   _   set of three tiger babies. As this was a very unusual event,   everyone   at the zoo was very excited. Unfortunately, the tiger babies were born ahead of time and due to their tiny size, they   _   shortly after birth.\nAlthough   _   she was fine after she gave birth, the mother tiger was dispirited. The mother tiger's   _   was caused by the loss of babies. The   _   came up with an idea of making her take the place of another mother   _  . After checking with many other   _   across the country, all the people were  _   by the result that there were no tiger babies of the right age to introduce to the poor mother.\nThe veterinarians didn't   _   the plan of improving the tiger's situation and again they thought of another idea, which was to   _   the tigers with little babies from an entirely different species  . Sometimes a mother of one species will   take on   the care of a different species. So they   _   five little pigs. It seemed like they could   _   the tiger, but no one knew what the tiger's   _    would be. Would she see them as a meal, or accept them as her own? Then they came up with the   _   idea of wrapping   the pigs in tiger skins.\nEveryone held their breath as they placed the pigs in with the mother tiger.   _   they felt joy when instead of   _   them as dinner the tiger accepted them as her new babies! These little pigs now have a   _   tiger mommy to look after them, and the mother tiger has a way to share her love.",
