    "article": "Teaching second grade is always a challenge.Each student arrives at school with his own needs and difficulties.One year a student called Billy  _  me with his behavior as well as his academic requirements.He struggled daily with his  _  emotions and often became angry or violent.I knew that,to make  _  progress,his emotions needed controlling. One  _  I tried to help Billy was to have him come directly into the classroom when he arrived at school.Billy's mom would  _  me to alert me to a particularly emotional morning at home.Then,I would focus on  _  his anger and calming him down before the other students arrived. One week our class was studying  _  .I thought one way to bring learning into the classroom was to bring my dog Rocky to school for the day. That day began as normal.I was preparing activities focused on dog themes  _  I was told that Billy had a  _  morning at home and I might need to get him  _  .As I was talking to his mom,Billy  _  into the classroom.To Billy's  _  ,Rocky immediately ran up to his new  _  ,wagging his tail and licking Billy's face with doggy affection.Billy couldn't  _  Rocky's charm and began laughing as his anger melted away. Throughout the day,Billy never left Rocky's side,feeding him,being gentle with him and even  _  the other students while Rocky was sleeping. Billy was known for doing anything he could to avoid  _  ,but on this day he found a good dog story,\" Clifford's Puppy Days\",and read it to Rocky.How  _  I was at the sight of Billy reading happily!My little dog was able to  _  Billy's day from one of anger and frustration to one of laughter,gentleness and  _  . That day Rocky more than helped me with my  _  ;he helped to change the life of a child!After that Billy's behavior definitely improved.",
