There was just my younger brother and myself in the house. One evening Dad came home from  _  and there was no food in the house, not  _  a piece of bread.

He  _  the house and about two hours later returned and quickly  _  us up. He had in his hand two small potato pies, which he gave us to eat. I don't know where he got the  _  but somehow he  _  to get us something to eat. My father had not eaten and had worked all day  _  he sat there with great satisfaction watching us eat.

I guess the  _  I am trying to make is that in difficult times it is  _  not to show weakness but strength and character.
