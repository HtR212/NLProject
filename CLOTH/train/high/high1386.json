    "article": "Once President Roosevelt's house was broken into and lots of things were stolen. Hearing this, one of Roosevelt's friends wrote to him and advised him not to take it to his   _  so much. President Roosevelt wrote\nback immediately, saying,\" Dear friend, thank you for your letter to  _  me. I'm all right now. I think I should thank God. This is because of the\nfollowing three reasons: firstly, the thief only stole things from me but did\nnot  _  me at all; secondly, the thief has stolen some\nof my things  instead of  all my things; thirdly, most luckily\nfor me, it was the man  rather than  me who became a thief...\"\n  It was quite unlucky for anyone to be stolen from.... However, President Roosevelt had such three reasons to be so   _  . This story tells us\nhow we can learn to be grateful in our life.\n  Being grateful is an important philosophy of life and a great wisdom.... It is impossible for anyone to be lucky and successful all the time   so long as  he lives in the world. We should learn how to face failure or misfortune\nbravely and  _  and to try to deal with it. If\nso, should we complain about our life and become  _  and\ndisappointed ever since then or should we be grateful for our life,  _  again ourselves after a fall? William Thackeray, a famous British writer,\nsaid, \"Life is a mirror. When you smile in front of it, it will also smile and  _  will it when you cry to it.\" If you are grateful to life, it will bring you\nshining sunlight. If you always complain about everything, you may own  _  in the end. When we are successful, we can  _  have\nmany reasons for being grateful, but we have only one excuse to show\nungratefulness if we fail.\n  I think we should even be grateful to life   _  we are\nunsuccessful or unlucky. Only by doing this can we find our weakness and\nshortcomings when we fail. We can also get  _  and\nwarmth when we are unlucky. This can help us find our courage to overcome the\ndifficulties we may face, and receive great impetus   to   move on  .\nWe should treat our frustration and misfortune in our\nlife  in the other way  just as President\nRoosevelt did. We should be grateful all the time and keep having a\nhealthy  _  to our life forever, keep having perfect\ncharacters and enterprising spirit. Being grateful is not only a kind of\ncomfort, not  an escape  from life and nor thinking of winning\nin spirit like Ah Q. Being grateful is a way to sing for our life which comes\njust from our love and  _  .",
