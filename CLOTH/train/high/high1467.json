    "article": "Modern zoos are very different from zoos built fifty years ago. At that time, zoos were places where people could  go to   see  animals from  many  parts of the world. The animals lived in  _  with iron  bars.  The  cages  were  easy  to  keep  clean.  _     ,for  the  animals, the cageswere  small  and impossible to hide in. Although the zoo   _   took good care of them,many of the  _  did not feel comfortable and they often became   _  .\nIn modern zoos, people can see animals in more  _  conditions. The animals are given more  _  in large places so that they can live more as they would in   _   . Even the appearance of zoos has changed. Trees and grass grow in the cages, and water flows  _   the places that the animals live in.There are few bars.  Instead  ,  there  is  often  a  deep  ditch,  filled  with   _  , which surrounds  a space where several   _  of animals live together as they would naturally. In an American zoo, the visitor can walk through a huge special cage that is filled with    _  ,some small animals and many birds, and large enough for the birds to live  _  .In a zoo in New York, because of special  night  _   ,people can observe certain animals that are  _  only  at night, when most zoos are closed. Some zoos have special places for visitors to  watch  animals that live in the desert, or under water. Some other zoos have special places for animals that live in cold conditions like the  _  from the Arctic.\nModern zoos not only show animals for visitors, but also  _  and save rare animals. For this reason, fifty years from now, the grandchildren of today's visitors will still be able to enjoy watching these animals.",
