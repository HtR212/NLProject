As the countdown progresses, the rocket's engines  _  and give it the required push to tear through the atmosphere and  _  the earth's gravitation.\nThese rockets take astronauts and manmade satellites into  _  . The satellites are used for communication, weather monitoring and research. But how do satellites  _  up without falling down, you  _  ask?\nTake a strong rope. Tie a small stone to one  _  to make a sling. Rotate the sling using one hand, you will  _  that the rope straightens out and becomes  _  as the sling rotates. As soon as you stop rotating, the rope slackens again.   _  does the rope tighten on being rotated?\nThe answer to this question will  _  the answer to our query how satellites remain in space without  _  down. When the sling is rotated, there are two  _  acting on the stone. The force of rotation, which tries to take the stone away from you and the force applied by your hand, which tries to  _  the stone towards you.\n  _  you are rotating the sling, the two forces balance each other out and  _  the stone keeps going round and round. If you  _  the sling midway, the sling will fly off.\nA satellite works in the same way. One of the two  _  forces acting on the satellite is the force of gravitation.   The other  force is that which is created by the rotation of the satellite  _  the earth. An orbiting satellite has these two forces balanced out so the satellite doesn't fall down to the earth.",
