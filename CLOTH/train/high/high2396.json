    "article": "One day,some of the girls in our neighborhood started acting a bit strangely towards me.They  _  talking to me.After a day or so of this,I finally  found out  what was going on.I'd said something to a(n)  _  girl the night before that she didn't like.I'd had a few  _  that night, and like everyone I sometimes say things that  _  severer than I mean them to. Anyway,it seemed that the girl had told many of her friends,and now they were all  _  at me.They found a great  _  to think of all the other supposed\"crimes\"I'd committed over the past year.  While  they'd all really liked me before, suddenly they  _  I was a really bad guy. This was a difficult problem.I  _  to get along well with these people and I liked them all.I didn't want them to  _  me because of something stupid I'd said when I was drunk.It didn't  _  much whether they or I was wrong.All I wanted was things to be  _  to normal again. So I wrote the popular girl a note  _  saying:\"I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.I didn't mean to\".And that was it.The problem was solved.  In fact  .the girls who were angry with me now liked me  _  than ever.They felt I'd done something  _  in admitting I was wrong and apologizing. Learn how and when to  _  .Often,the pride and stubbornness you hold onto by refusing to back down isn't worth the  _  of a lasting argument.An apology can  _  for healing a difficult situation.And often, people will think better of you for it.",
