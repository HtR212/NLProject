    "article": "Tick,tock,tick,tock. I'm sitting here,watching the movements of my existence pass slowly away. My house has been  _  for such a long time,and I'm lonely and forgotten. Sitting here, by myself, all that I can do is  look back  and think about my past. I could tell you stories that only walls would know. But walls can't speak. For a time, I was left alone, while people came and  looked at  the house.... Then, one day a nice couple moved in with a young son. From the beginning, their son Danny liked to stay with me, and I was completely  _  with him. He always looked as if he loved the stories I told, most of which began with. ''Back in my day...\" and ''When I was  _  ....\"I sometimes had the kind of idea that he didn't really understand what I was saying,but it felt good to be  _  . When Danny went off to college, my heart broke. Soon afterward,  I  sold the house.... New owners came and  _  . Then, one day it so happened that I was in when a new family was moving into the house. You can't even imagine my  _  when, unexpectedly, Danny walked through the front door. He had a  _  and kids now. I was so overjoyed when I saw him that I put all my energy into my daily activities. ... I spent the next twenty years watching his kids grow up, with a mixture of pride and  _  about what would happen next. The kids finally became  _  and Danny sold the house. That was about five years ago.... Some of the local kids have started the rumor that the house is haunted --- and, in  _  way, it is. It is haunted by memories of all the people who have lived in it. Every second has  _  me so much. I have been counting them down and they are almost up for me.... I hope that someday somebody will  _  me, and drop in on me again. Maybe then I'll get a new home and an opportunity for a whole new set of memories.",
