At our stop I   _   the man had two young boys and his own share of   _   to deal with, but he was still trying to help the mother. So I   _    to take her from there and the man thanked me, leaving for his own flight.\nThe mother showed me her   _   and I noticed that her flight 30 _  in 10 minutes and she had a handcart and a   _   which was the size of my bag. There was no time to lose. She gave me her ticket and I took the suitcase while she   _   the handcart. It was at this time that it occurred to me how much   _   she had in me.
