I became  _  and angry. I would even shut myself in my room for hours. The exams were approaching, but I  _  didn't care. My parents and teachers were  _  at my bad performance. Constant quarrels made life at home a living hell--all because of me. One morning, after a hard  _  from Dad, I stood blankly at the school gate. As the other students  _  to their classrooms, our English teacher found me.  _  what I'd done, she led me to her office. The next 45 minutes were the most  _  moments of my life. She said she had noticed a big  _  in me. She wanted to know why I was so often  _  and unhappy. She took my hand in hers and listened  _  as I spilled out my worries. She then hugged me  as  I sobbed my closed emotions out. I could feel my months of frustration and loneliness melt  _  . No one had tried to understand what the real problem was, but my teacher had done it with her  _  act of just listening to me with such attention and  _  . She  _  to be my best friend. From then on, I often went to her office and we discussed my problems, hobbies and everything  _  my mind. I looked forward to school every day. As the exams  _  again, I studied hard. When the results were declared, everybody was pleased. But happiest of all was my English teacher. With tears of joy, she  _  me with a pen. Today I have become a happy  _  thanks to her.",
