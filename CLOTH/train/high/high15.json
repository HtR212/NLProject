I want to  _   you something in the garden.\"\n    Harry walked into the garden with his father, who led him along   _  they came to a bed in which peas  were growing. Not a weed was to be  _   about their roots.\n\"See how beautifully these peas are   _  , my son,\" said Mr. Williams. \"How clean and healthy the vines  look. We shall have a good   _  .

The weeds are nearly as   _  as the peas themselves. There won't be half a crop!\" \"   _   are they so much worse than ours, Harry?\"\n\"Because they have been left to grow as they   _  .

A garden will soon be overrun with weeds   _   it is not taken good care of,\" Mr. Williams   _  , \"and so it is with the human garden. Children's minds are like garden beds. They must be  _   cared for. I send you to school in order that the garden of your  _   may have good seeds and   _  plentifully. Now which would you   _  , to stay at home or go to school?\"\n\"I would rather go to school,\" said Harry.",
