    "article": "When I began my high school years,I was quite interested in biology. I\nread lots of books of my father's about animals,and I was   _  much\neducated about such things that I was very satisfied with myself.\nOne Sunday afternoon,I was   _  with\nfriends about animals.I said that the whale was a mammal animal, but they   _  .Finally, we turned to a   _  for help.I knew I was   _  ,so I was looking forward to the teacher   _  was right.My friends were eager for an opposite answer. We asked her   _  the whale was a\nmammal.\"No, the whale is a fish,\"she said without a moment's   _  .\n  You could have knocked me over with a feather.My   _  was\nhurt, and  of course I lost the argument,but that wasn't the main reason I was too   _  to\nspeak.I still knew I was right,which   _  the teacher was wrong. Not only was she wrong,  _   she was completely ignorant  about something that I thought was   _  knowledge.But she was my teacher and had taught for a long time.Every one   _  her and no one else thought she\ncould be wrong.\n      _  that,I hadn't thought that grown-ups could be wrong. And this  _  shaped\nthe way I viewed people as I grew up.Whenever I found that if anyone treated another person   _  too much respect\nand admiration,I thought,   _  silly\".From then on,I had no   _  for\nauthority .\n   Through this matter,I got an idea that everybody has his   _  ,even he is a great man.",
