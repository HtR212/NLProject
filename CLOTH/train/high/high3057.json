How can we tell?\" the child asked. Dad felt it was his  _  to give a more satisfying answer. \"Son, snowflakes are like people. We are each  _  in a very special way. We can test it right now,\" he said. The child stood up, put out his hands, and  _  as snowflakes landed on his gloves. \"These snowflakes are all different on my gloves, but those in the yard look the same. Together they are even more  _  and striking. Then if people are like snowflakes, why don't they  get along  well?\" \"Choice,\"Dad said. \"Their choices  _  them what they are.\" \"  _  choice is a bad thing?\" the boy asked. \"Oh, no. Only when we choose the  _  things.\" \"How do we tell right from wrong?\" the child asked. Dad was given the chance to build upon the foundation of his son's  _  . He reached down and began to  _  with the snow. He  _  the snow into two sides, three large snowballs on one side and several smaller ones on the other. \"Which side did the right thing?\" he asked the boy. The child looked at both sides but  couldn' t  answer. Then Dad placed the three larger snowballs on top of each other. \"It' s a snowman! The side  _  made me snowman!\" the boy replied with  _  Yes, all these people came together and recognized how special each of them was, so they joined in a(n)  _  to build up mankind,\" Dad said. The child then stood up and  _  an arm full of the smaller snowballs. One by one he began to throw them at the other small piles of snow. He said,\"This is what happens when people can't work together. They have a(n)  _  .\" Dad was shocked. He stood up, lifted the boy and  _  him tightly, whispering to him, \"I hope that your world will learn to work and live together. I hope you will make the right  _  and learn to build the best snowman ever.\"",
