    "article": "This morning, as I was getting close to the supermarket, I saw a small  _  gathering around an elderly woman with blood under her face. I stopped and asked if I could  help out  . I told her I was certified in first aid. Then I  _  someone for a first aid kit . But she didn't want help, saying she was fine. But she wasn't fine. I asked her to  _  with me and we  _  about her routine of getting groceries. People brought out ice packs, water and paper towels from the  _  nearby. I put on the gloves from the first aid kit, and cleaned her up a bit, but  _  I just talked to her and held her hand. Two  _  happened to be passing by and  _  to help check her out a bit. Finally, after ten minutes the  _  arrived and I talked to the emergency medical team and they  took over  . I was certified in first aid years back, and I got re-certified a month ago, but I never  _  it once. However, I realized being certified isn't  _  about providing the aid. I didn't stop the bleeding. I didn't  _  to examine her. Mostly it was about providing comfort for people in a difficult  _  . The certification gave me the  _  to do that: to kneel on the sidewalk, holding an old woman's hand, and to help make those  _  few minutes just a little bit better. If you're not certified in first aid, I can't  _  it strongly enough. It takes four hours of your time at your  _  Red Cross. With what you'll  _  , maybe you'll be able to help someone like the old lady one day.",
