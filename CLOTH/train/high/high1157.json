    "article": "This happened years ago when I was a waitress,but I still remember this specific incident so vividly .As the end of the night was   _  ,ten minutes before our restaurant closed,a gentleman came in.I was the   _  waitress who got to stay after closing to serve him his food.\nThe customer was quite  _  with how his food was prepared.He sent his  _  back twice.When it eventually arrived to his liking,he  _  some fresh coffee.Meanwhile,my manager and our cooks were  _  me closely,as they wanted the last customer of the  _  to finally leave so that we could  close up  the shop and go home.  At that time I was frustrated and tired.I also knew he would probably not  _  very well,seeing his inexpensive meal  _  ,I tried to give him good service.\nThen in the last ten minutes,as I was refilling his coffee,I somehow  _  it on the table as well as his plate.I apologized,but I was  _  to get him another plate of  food as everything was shut down in the  _  .Knowing his previous temperament ,I had a certain  _  of how he might react.He asked to speak to the manager.\nBut he  _  shocked me at this point.Instead of  _  to my boss,he simply said,\"This young lady's done a fine job.You need to keep her  _  as long as you can!\" After that he paid his bill and left,and I eagerly went home.\nThe next morning when I came to work and   picked up  my tips--you often don't get it till the next day34 if a customer charges it on a credit card--I was  _  that the customer had offered a $15 tip for his $8 dinner.People are often much nicer than they look!",
