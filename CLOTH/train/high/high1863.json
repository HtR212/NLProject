    "article": "I made up my mind to drive to South Carolina to meet my friends in my used car. Though I had only been there once  _  and did not know the  _  very well, I was on the  _  after I had made some inquiries . At Ashvelle, there was a crossroad where I could go on along the main road or I could take a short cut. The short cut was to  _  several hills and was dangerous, I hesitated for a little while and then chose the main road, for I wanted to be  _  . Something strange happened after I drove a long  _  and found it was not the correct road that I wanted to  _  , but the hilly road I decided to avoid. I realized that it was at the  _  that I had made the  _  mistake. \"What shall I do?\" I asked myself. If I went back to take that road again, it would be very late by the time I got to Columbia. Thinking it  _  , I decided to go on. \"If  other  people can go along this road, why can't I?\" I  _  myself The short cut, to my surprise ,was not that  _  . In fact, it was only a very peaceful country road,  _  up and down two low  _  .There was  _  traffic. On both sides of the road, you could see trees, wild flowers, and  _  with cows and horses. My fear was  _  with the wind. Listening to the beautiful country music over my car stereo , I drove on and  _  the scenery which was so quiet and so natural. Even my used car forgot to give me  _  . It was just in this light heartedness that I arrived at my destination. My friends, after they heard what had happened to me, all said it sounded like an adventure.",
