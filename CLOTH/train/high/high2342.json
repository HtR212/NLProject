    "article": "It was the first time in Cindy's 12 years that she had tried to make a cake, but it wasn't exactly a success. The cake was well lumpy  . And it tasted   _  , as if she   had used up   the sugar. Besides, the   _   was in a mess with all the fixings for cake out of place.\nBut Cindy wasn't thinking about the mess. She was anxious for her parents to   _   home, so she could   _   her gift to them. She turned off the lights and waited   _   in the darkness. When at last she saw the   _   of the car's headlights, she   _   herself in the kitchen doorway. When she heard the   _   sliding into the front door, she was close to exploding.\nHer parents entered quietly, but Cindy would have   _   of that. She turned on the lights dramatically and gestured towards the kitchen   _  , where a slightly off-balance cake awaited   _   praise. But her mother saw nothing but the   _  . She shouted, \"How many times have I talked to you about cleaning up after yourself?\"\n\"But, Mom. I was only...\"\n\"Clean this up immediately.\"\n  _  , Cindy's mother isn't the only parent who   suffers from   the occasional inability to see the wood for the trees. Sometimes we allow ourselves to be   _   to things of long-term significance by the thing that seems   _   now -- but isn't.   _   kitchen sanitation   is important, is it   _   the sacrifice   of tender feelings and relationships? As patents, there are times when we   _   need to see the mess in the kitchen, and times when we only need to see the cake.",
