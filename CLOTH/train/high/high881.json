As I was curiously  searching  different websites and guidebooks, getting ready for my little adventure, I  _  that besides getting all the necessities, I also needed to get a sun  _  . When I got to the shop, it  _  occurred to me that in the middle of planning my  _  ,I somehow hadn't paid much attention to the calendar. It was Feb.14, and Valentine's fever had  taken over  the whole shopping center. I finally  _  a rack with summer hats hanging on it .I walked over and tried on a couple.
