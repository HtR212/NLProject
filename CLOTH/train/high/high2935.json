Some groups of North America Indians were experts   at sending   messages . For example , a small stone on top of a large one meant \" This is the way .\" If there was another small stone on the right , it meant \" Turn right .\" Some grass with a knot ( )meant \" Danger \"  and so on   .\nMaybe you know that in the forests of Africa , it   used to be difficult   to travel from village . But drum (  )   could be heard   from many kilometers away . So , some groups of Africans made their drums   \"speak\"   like people .\nThe Incas (  )of South America used to send messages by typing knots in a rope. Messages have been found , but   nobody   can understand   what   they mean . And the Egyptians used pictures as a kind of   . writing   but only   a few   people   were taught   to understand them . \nToday , we also use   a lot of symbols   . When we are in a car and we see a red light , we stop the car . When a mother says to her child ,\" Eat your cake!\" the child eats the cake sometimes . The red light and the words of the mother are   symbols   . And it is a   fact   that the basic means of communication between people is , of course , sounds . \nMaybe you know that there are   _   than 3000  languages in the world today . And about 13 of them are spoken by large groups of people . Languages of the world are both similar ( )   _   different . They are similar because we can talk and write about the same things and they are different because we talk and write about these things in   _   ways and we use different   _   . \nIt is   no wonder   that we have to learn a second language   in order to   communicate with people who do not speak our language .",
