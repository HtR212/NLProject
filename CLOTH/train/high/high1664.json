I didn't want my little dogs  _  in it, so I reluctantly  _  on my heavy coat and grabbed the snow shovel to make a  _  . I had only gotten a bit done, however,  _  the handle of my old snow shovel  _  with a \"snap\". Laughing and shaking my head, I  _  to wait out the storm for a while. It was late in the afternoon when the snow finally  _  and I trudged over to my Dad's house to borrow his shovel and  _  again. By then the 10 inches of snow had turned into a foot and a half. I started out slow setting a steady  _  and stopping to rest whenever my back started to ache. After a while, though, the  _  finally broke and the sun peeked out to  _  me on. The work seemed a lot easier then even though it was still  _  . I even sang a few Christmas carols and  _  while I cleared out the drives, cleaned off the cars, and shoveled out the paths. After an hour of hard work the job was finally done.  _  , I let the child that still lives  _  of me fall back into the snow and  _  a snow angel for the angels in Heaven to see.
