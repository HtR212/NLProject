    "article": "War started in our house in late July with a month to go before my first day of college. It was a battle of wills over what college I was to attend. Mom wanted me to attend a famous \n  _   school, and I wanted to go to a small writing college. Every night for two weeks, we argued, shouted and gave   _   treatments until both sides went to bed with regrets.\nIt was mostly my   _  . Since my junior year of high school, I had   _   at being a nurse. I took all the science courses, and even worked as a 40 _  in my town's local hospital. My   _   was to help the sick and be superwoman to the world.\nYet,   _   graduation and college neared, it all changed. Treating the sick was\n  _  , but not what I was meant to do for the   _   of my life. I could picture myself in hospitals, making rounds, and taking   _  , but I couldn't picture myself happy. It wasn't the  _   I wanted.\nThen, I realized I had been creating and writing stories for as long as I could   _  .  I loved it, and writing was what I had been doing as a   _  . It was going to be my career. And it had to be.\nOn August 1st, Mom and I sat down at the dinner table and I told her that she had every  _   to choose where to spend her money, just like I had every right to decide where I wanted to go to school. If it was her choice not to   _   any of my college education, then I would take a year off to work and earn money so I could go to the college I wanted.\nStanding by my decision to be a writer had   _   my firm belief to my mom. Finally we were at   _  , and she decided to support me, which   _   the world to me.\nBefore that time, I had never stood up   _   my parents on any major decision. Choosing which college to attend   _   me to become a separate and complete adult. I am now finished with my first semester as a Professional Writing major and I cannot wait to see what comes next.",
