    "article": "Before India gained independence , a few young men from the villages wanted to free India from the foreign rule; they wanted the British to quit India. They needed material wealth to  _  the British out of India, so they started collecting  _  in the Indian villages. One day, they got encouraged to collect  _  things as well. They went from door to door carrying a huge bag, which gradually was  _  with money and gifts. As they went, a one-legged beggar kept  _  them. The young men did not mind. At the  _  of the day, they entered a house to see  _  they had collected. The beggar also wanted to enter, but since he was not a member of the group, they did not  _  him in. The beggar said to them: \"I walked such a  _  distance right behind you. You want freedom; I also want freedom. India is not only your motherland. It is also my motherland.\"  At first  , the young men got mad and told the beggar to go away. Then one of the men felt  _  for him, so they decided to  _  him the things they had collected.  _  the beggar was looking at the gifts in their bag, most of them were showing no  _  for him. Then suddenly the beggar opened up the bag that he had been carrying. It  _  a few coins and some rice. He threw all the contents into their bag at once. At the  _  of this, immediately all the members of the revolutionary group started dropping  _  of gratitude , because he had  _  all that he had to their cause. On that day, they had gone to visit so many rich families, who had given them next to  _  ; but this beggar had given them everything that he had! They were deeply  _  by the beggar's contribution.",
