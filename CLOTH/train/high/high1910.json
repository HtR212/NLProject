Why do you stand there as if you have 42 given up  the thought of eating?\" \"I am 43 _  ,\" said the crane. \"Because I heard the fishermen say they will pick up every fish in the pool tomorrow. I shall have nothing to 44 live on  when that happens. I am now prepared to die of   _  .\"\n    The fishes in the pool heard what the crane said, and they said to each other in   _  , \"Since he and we have a   _   enemy, perhaps the wise crane can advise us what to do.\" So they asked the crane how they may   _   themselves. \"There is only one   _  ,\" said the crane. \"You must get to another pool 50 _  it is too late. I know a pool nearby. Let me carry you there.\"\n                  The fishes 51 _  among themselves and said: \"Since we can't save ourselves, we must 52 _  with the crane.\" They agreed to let the crane 53 _  them to the pool. The    _   crane took the fishes to a spot nearby, where he ate them. He returned for more,    _    that all the others were safe in another pool.\n               Finally all the fishes were    _   , and the crab said: \"Sir, take me also to that pool, for I   _   to be with the fishes.\" The crane carried him to the spot where he had eaten the fishes. When the crab saw the   _   on the ground, he thought to himself: \"I am cheated! Yet when the wise are   _  , they will die fighting instead of giving up, even if there is no 60 _  of saving them-selves.\" Then the crab fastened his claws upon the crane's throat and tore at it until the crane died.",
