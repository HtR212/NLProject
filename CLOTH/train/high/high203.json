I have a math teacher who  _  to see struggling math students. He always  laughs at  the slow students  _  he gets a chance. For example, the teacher often  looks down upon  a student because of her failure in math. It's not that this student is stupid but rather she has no  interest in  math. The math teacher always gives the girl the cold shoulder and says this girl is the stupidest one he has  _  seen. Once the girl got the lowest score in  _  exam of math, the teacher made fun of her and then let other students in class  _  who had the worst score. When that girl student had questions to ask him, he  _  to give her  _  answer. Finally, the girl says to me that the paradise is too far from her and she feels that there is no way to reach it. She also feels that she's like a tiny paper boat which is  _  into the water and will  _  flow out to sea until it can't be seen. What a lonely vision that is!

Teachers should learn how to  _  the slower students properly, how to encourage them more often and not to  _  their feelings. Please leave a little bit of love for these  _  students. \"It is not how much we do, but how much love we put in the doing.
