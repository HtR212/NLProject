    "article": "Just off La Rambla Street in Barcelona, I skimmed through The Saints   of Spain in a bookstore. It would be a good read for the  _  home. At that moment, I couldn't help thinking of my own personal saint, the angel who'd  _  my trip.\nIt was the first time for me to travel abroad and I called it a \"spiritual journey\". I hadn't  _  a hotel before setting out  _  I thought I could find a cheap one when I arrived.  In fact  ,  it turned out to be a(n)  _  .\nI knew  _  Spanish, but the quick, sad  _  of each hotel owner's head was easily understood -- no room at the hotel. The sun had just gone down below the horizon  ,I didn't know what to do and began to  _  . Just then, an old man came  _  with a hat covering his white hair. He asked me if I needed any help. I supposed maybe he  _  the worried look on my face.\nAfter explaining why I was there, he asked me to  _  him. At first, I  _  whether the stranger did that out of kindness. However, considering my situation, I had no other choice but to  believe in  him. I walked behind him and passed through a narrow, dark side street. Finally he rang the bell on a door. \"You will stay here,\" he said. \"It is a  _  place.\"\nHe was  _  . My room was huge --with a bed, a desk and even a bath. I wanted to  _  him, but he'd gone away. \"This man can be trusted,\" I thought.\nNow , at the  _  , I felt a tap   on my shoulder. It was him ! So he was  _  . \"I want to thank you. What's your name ? \" I said.\n\"Raphael,\" he said. \"You're very welcome.\" With that, he went away into the crowd on La Rambla. \"He was not an angel but just a kind  _  ,\" I thought.\nOn the planet, I turned to a page in The Saints of Spain by chance. \"Raphael,\" it read, \"is known as the supporter of travellers. He helps guide spiritual journeys.\" Yes, he does.",
