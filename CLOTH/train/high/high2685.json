    "article": "The day I was given the news was a cold Saturday. My mom sat me on the floor and opened her mouth to give me the most  _  words I'd ever heard: \"Grandma Billie has been diagnosed with cancer.\" Tears filled my eyes immediately. Mom continued, \"Grandma is old and her body is too  _  . There's nothing they can do to treat her.\" I knew this wasn't my mom's fault but I was so  _  . I was almost yelling at my mom, \"So, they're just going to let her  _  ?\"\nWe had to just wait for her to die. I couldn't even  _  the thought. We went to the hospital right away. The doctor said, \"Billie has a tumor in her  _  . She won't be able to  _  because it hurts her too much. One option is a feeding tube, but there are times when it will be uncomfortable.\" At the end, the doctor sighed, \"With a feeding tube, she would probably have three  _  at most.\"\nMy whole family on my mom's side was really  _  and they were all looking to God to make this easy. I couldn't handle it. If God was so wonderful and so  _  then why did he allow all these awful things to happen to good people? Why was he letting my grandma die?\nI came and visited every day after  _  practice. Grandma would tell me the  _  stories over and over again, but every time I was just as surprised and excited to hear them. She was getting  _  really fast and every time I came to see her it broke my heart more.\n3 weeks later, after the softball practice, I was getting ready to see grandma when mom appeared in the locker room. She opened her mouth but at first no words came out. She  _  again, \"You can't go to see grandma today because she just died.\" Silence. I couldn't  _  anyone else in the room. Mom sat next to me and we both held each other and cried.",
