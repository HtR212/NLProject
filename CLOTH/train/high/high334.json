    "article": "A beautiful ,expensively dressed lady came to see her doctor and complained that her whole  _  was empty: it had no meaning. The doctor called over the old lady who  cleaned  the office floors, and then said to the rich lady, \"I'm going to  _  Mary here to tell you how she found happiness.  _  I want you to do is to listen.\" So the old lady put  _  her broom and began her story: \"Well, my husband died of malaria and three months later my  _  son was killed by a car. I had nobody... I had nothing  _  . I couldn't sleep; I couldn't eat; I never smiled at  _  , I even thought of taking my own life. Then one evening a little  _  followed me home from work. Somehow I felt  _  for it. I decided to let the cat  _  . I got it some milk, and it licked the  _  clean. Then it purred and rubbed against my  _  , and for the first time in months, I smiled. Then I began to think: if  _  a little cat could make me smile, maybe doing something for people could make me  _  . So the next day I took some biscuits to a neighbor who was  _  in bed. Every day I tried to do something  _  for someone. It made me so happy to  _  them happy. Today, I don't know of anybody who sleeps and eats better than I do. I've found  _  , by giving it to others.\" When she heard that, the rich lady cried. She had everything that  money  could buy, but she had lost the things which money couldn't buy.",
