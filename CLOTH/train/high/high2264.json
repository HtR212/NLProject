This young man had  _  hair on the sides of his head and a patch of blue hair on top of it. He had a nose ring, which was  _  to a ring he was wearing in his ear by a  _  . He held a skateboard under one  _  and a basketball under the other. Caitlyn, who was walking ahead of me,  _  when she saw the teen. I thought he'd  _  her, and she'd frozen on the spot. I was  _  . My angel went back to the door and opened it as wide as it would go. Now I was  face to face  with the young man. I stepped  _  and let him pass. His  _  was a polite one, \"Thank you very much.\" On our way back home, I praised Caitlyn for her  _  in holding open the door for the young man. She didn't seem to be troubled by his  _  , but I wanted to  make sure  . Once we had spoken I realized it was me who needed to  think about  the way I had responded.

She saw a person carrying something under each arm and heading towards a closed door. In future, I hope I am as  _  as her and not so judgmental about others.",
