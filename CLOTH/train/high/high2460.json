    "article": "\"I love myself.\" That sounds a bit   _   and I doubt if anyone would ever say it out loud, but finding the confidence to succeed is very   _   if you don't love yourself. If you're ready to love yourself, keep on reading.\nThink Positively\nFocus on your   _   instead of your weaknesses. Leap out of bed; don't   _   out of it. Look at every day as a new   _  , not the same old story.\nBe Thankful\nBe   _  of all the things you should be thankful for. Make a note of the people, places, things and   _   that bring you the most joy. If you   slow down  , you'll realize you have an awful lot to be thankful for.\nLearn and Grow\nDeveloping your   _   and skills will help you develop   _   that you can do anything.\nAccept Your Flaws  \nMy handwriting looks   _  , I can't ride a bike, and I have an unexplained   _  of bees, which is so bad that I once drove my car into a stop sign after  _  flew into my car through an open window on a summer day. And you know what? I wouldn't   _   any of them. Be confident in yourself, no matter how \"weird\" (interesting and unique) you  _  be.\nUse Your Strengths\nThink about the top three   _   in your life. I don't care how big or little they are. It could be graduating from college, landing a sweet job, losing weight, or   _  . Now write down the strengths you used to accomplish those three things, and do you see any common threads that   led to   achievement? If so, the path to more success is right in front of you.\nNo More Comparisons\nForget about the celebrities you   _   your body to, the relationships you contrast yours with. Life is not a   _  . Your only goal is to become a better version of yourself.",
