    "article": "I was doing some last-minute Christmas shopping in a toy store.  A nicely dressed little girl was   _    through the teddy bears  beside her father   _   she saw a little boy walk in and stop in front of the Pokemon toys.  His jacket was obviously too small. He had  money in his hand.    _   , it seemed to add up to five dollars at most. He was with his father as well, and kept   _   the Pokemon video games. Each time he showed one to his father, his father   _    his head, \"No.\"\nRather    _   , the boy gave up the video games and chose a picture book   _  .  After they walked away, the  little  girl  ran  over to  the  Pokemon video games. She excitedly picked up one   _   on top of the others, and raced down toward the check-out. I picked up  my purchases and   _   the girl and her father.\nThen much to her   _   , the little boy and his father got in line   _   her and me. After the video was paid for and bagged, the  little girl   _    it back to the cashier ( ) and said something secret to her. The cashier smiled and put the     _   under the  counter ( ). I was putting things in my bag when the little boy      _    up to the cashier. The cashier said, \"Congratulations, you're my hundredth customer today, and you win a(n)   _   !\" And she handed the boy the Pokemon game. The boy could only stood  there in   _   . It was, he said,    _    what he had wanted! The little girl and her father had been standing at the doorway, and I saw the biggest and sweetest smile on her face I have    _    seen in my life.\nI suddenly understood that the world is not   _    into the strong who care and the weak who are   cared for   . We must each in turn care and be cared for.",
