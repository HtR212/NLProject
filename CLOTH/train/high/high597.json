    "article": "There is an English saying: \"Laughter is the best medicine.\" Until recently, few people took the saying seriously. Now, however, doctors have begun to look into laughter and the  _  it has on the human body. They have found that laughter really can  _  people's health. Tests were carried out to study the effects of laughter on the body. People watched funny films  _  doctors checked their heart, blood pressure, breathing and muscles. It was found that laughter has similar effects to  _  exercise. It decreases blood pressure, the heart beat and breathing; it also works several groups of muscles in the face, the stomach, and even the feet. If laughter  _  the body, it must be beneficial. Other tests have shown that laughter appears to be able to reduce the effect of pain on the body. In one experiment doctors  _  pain in groups of students who listened to different radio programs. The group that tolerated the pain for the  _  time was the groups which listened to a funny program. The reason why laughter can reduce pain seems to be that it helps to produce a kind of chemicals in the brain which diminish( ) both stress and pain. As a  _  of these discoveries, some doctors in the United States now hold laughter clinics, in which they help to improve their patients' condition by  _  them to laugh. They have found that even if their patients do not really feel like laughing, making them smile is enough to produce beneficial effects  _  to those caused by laughter.",
