Some of these may be long-term   or  _  lifetime ones, and other dreams or wishes for more immediate satisfaction.\nJust as you  _  great pleasure when you're trying to  _  short-term goals, there's also power in having long-term and lifetime goals. Both  _  are valuable and serve each other. In order to be  _  in achieving a short- or long-term wish or goal, you must place your focus on the  _  result and train your mind on either a moment-to-moment, day-to-day, month-to-\nmonth, or year-to-year level.\nFor example,  _  a farmer is to plow   a straight line, he must keep his eye on a faraway point. If his attention is  _  just a few feet in front of him, he will not plow straight. So, in order for his field to be plowed straight, he must  _  and focus on his long-term goal.\nFocusing on a long-term goal can  _  the energy to get things done in the  _  . For instance, when a runner sets a(n)  _  to run a mile, he'll  _  be tired when he  _  the one-mile mark.  _  if this same runner sets a goal to run ten miles, he probably won't even be sweating   upon  passing  this same one-mile mark. If this very same runner was to set a goal to run 26 miles and keep his mind on the completion of this long  _  , not only wouldn't he be sweating, but most likely he wouldn't even be out of breath as he ran by the  _  mark.\nLong-term goals,  _  , can't be achieved without first achieving  _  goals. We may have a goal to climb a ladder  , but we have to take one step at a time in order to reach the top.",
