Getting a little  _  , he headed back to dinner. Then, he saw Grandma's pet duck, so he let it fly, hit the duck in the head, and  _  it. He was shocked and upset. In  _  , he hid the dead duck in the woodpile, only to see his sister  _  .Sally had seen it all,  _  she said nothing.  _  lunch that day grandma said, \"Sally, let's wash the dishes.\" But Sally said, \"Grandma, Johnny told me he wanted to  _  in the kitchen today, didn't you Johnny?\" And then she said to him in a(n)  _  voice, \"Remember, the duck?\" So Johnny did the dishes. Later Grandpa asked if  the children  wanted to go fishing, and Grandma said, \"I'm sorry but I need  Sally  to help make supper.\" Hearing this, Sally said with a smile, \"Well, that's  all right  but Johnny told me he wanted to help.\"  _  the duck, Johnny had to stay and Sally went fishing. After several days of Johnny doing both his  housework  and Sally's, he finally couldn't  _  it any longer. He came to Grandma and told her that he  _  the duck. She knelt down, gave him a hug ,and said,\"Sweet heart, I know. You see, I was standing at the window and I  _  the whole thing. But because I love you, I  _  you. But I was just  _  how long you would let Sally make a slave of you.\"",
