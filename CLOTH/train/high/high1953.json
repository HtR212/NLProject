    "article": "My mother has never beaten me and my brothers.   _  she found some\nspecial ways of punishment. One occurred when I was four.\n    One day at daycare, I   _  an extremely tired mother attempt to pick up her daughter. The little\ngirl asked her mother to have dinner in McDonald's, but the mother replied,\n\"Honey, not tonight. Mom has to go home and cook dinner for Daddy.\" \"But I\nwanna go.\" \"Susie, I said not tonight...\" Susie immediately dropped  to the floor  , kicking and screaming, \"I want to go to McDonald's.\" Her mother tried to\nstop Susie's tantrum , but   in vain  .\nFinally her mother\n  gave in  , \"Okay, Susie, let's go to McDonald's.\" Susie stopped yelling and   _  . I was amazed; and at\nthe same time, I was  _  that anything I wanted\ncould be got in this way.\n    That day my mother picked me up early from daycare to buy gifts for Christmas. When we passed by the toy section, I saw a white and red telephone   _  bells\nrang as it was pulled along. I asked, \"Mama, can I have that telephone?\" \"Baby,\nnot now, but if you are a good girl, maybe  Father Christmas  will\nbring it to you.\" \"But Mama, I want it right now.\" Her eyes  _  and her hand tightened on mine. \"Becky, you  can not  have\nthat telephone today, but if you misbehave, you can have a spanking .\"\n    By now we were standing in the long Holiday line in the Gift Department, and I   _  it\nwas now or never. I  lay down  on the ground and began\nscreaming, \"I want that telephone,\" over and over again. The shoppers looked at\nmy mother  _  my mother calmly said, \"Becky,\nyou'd better get up  by the count of  three or else.\nOne...Two...Three.\"\n      _  happened.\nI was still in full tantrum. So then she lay down beside me, and began kicking\nand screaming, \"I want a new car, I want a new house, I want some  _  , I want...\" Shocked, I stood up. \"Mama, stop. Mama get up,\" I  _  begged.\n    She stood. The others waiting in line began to clap, and then, laughed, patting my mother. The next thirty minutes in line was miserable for me as various parents left the Gift Department,\n  _   their heads at me and saying with a smile, \"I bet you'll never try that again.\"\n    And I didn't, because it left a lasting   _  picture more effective than\nany physical mark.",
