Curiosity has its own reason for existing. \" --Albert Einstein\nIt's no secret that curiosity makes learning more effective and  _  . Curious students not only ask questions, but also  _  seek out the answers. Without  _  , Sir Isaac Newton would have never put forward the laws of physics, Alexander Fleming probably wouldn't have  _  penicillin  ,and Marie Curie's pioneering research on radioactivity may not exist.\nCuriosity is just as  _  as intelligence in determining how well students do in school. Curiosity  _  the brain for learning. As we all known, we're more likely to  _  what we've learned when the subject matter interests us. Actually, curiosity also helpsus learn information wedon't consider  _  or important. So if a teacher is able to  _  students' curiosity, they'll be betterprepared to learn things that they would normally consider boring or difficult. For instance, if a student struggles with  _  , personalizing math problem tomatch their specific interest could help them  _  remember how to go about solving similar math problems in the future.\nHowever, scientists think that there arestill a few things that remain  _  about curiosity's role in learning. For one thing, scientists have yet to determine its long-term effects. For instance, if a student's curiosity is aroused at the  _  of a school day, will it help them better absorb information all day long? Another thing the  _  are keen to investigate is why some people are more  _  curious than others, and which factors most influence how curious we are.",
