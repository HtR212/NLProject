    "article": "I once worked in a charter school .There students with serious problems were put in  _  .So when the year ended in May,only  a few  students sitting in the classes had been there since the doors  _  in August. Chad was one of them.He started out in my first semester  _  class.He had taken the course twice already  _  earning a credit ,which was  _  at the school.He was too excited at times but fairly bright,and he never  _  a day of school during the first semester.Chad earned credit for first semester Spanish and moved on to the second. I noticed a huge  _  in him when he returned from Christmas vacation.He was quieter and worked harder.I was  _  by his big improvement.Towards the end of the spring semester,Chad missed several weeks of school.When he returned.He told me he was soon being sent to \"yearround school\". I  _  the \"yearround school\" was prison.I was  _  to learn that he had broken into someone's house.  _  I wanted to give him an award,some teachers said,\"You should give the award to someone else.\" I considered it.  _  in the end I decided to  _  Chad only on what he had done in my class. Chad's sentencing had been delayed, and he  made it  to school that day.He  _  reacted when I gave him an award for Most Improved.He hugged me  _  and said,\"Thank you.Now I have  _  to show my mom.\" Chad didn't finish second semester Spanish,and he never got  _  for the course.But I'd like to think that  _  made a difference in his life.",
