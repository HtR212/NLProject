Since our  _  was\ngiven prominent media exposure, we  _  thousands\nof calls per day.\nI spoke with countless victims who were trying to locate family members lost in the flood. They all needed  _  with housing, food and\nclothing. It took weeks  _  federal assistance was\navailable to the majority. Some received none.\n  Even though  we were there to help, the trauma  made some callers rude. Some were   _  . Some were suicidal . It was hard to stay  _  and encouraging. Just at that time, I got a call from Brenda.\nBrenda was a single woman  _  her early fifties with no\nchildren. She was all alone and had been living in a crowded  _  in Houston for the past month. She said, \"I've heard that my house\nwas still  _  and at this point, the hardest part\nof all of this, though, is seeing the  _  suffer.\nThe young tend to recover easily,  _  many of the\nelderly have no other resources.\"\nBrenda was hit hard but her heart still overflowed with  _  for\nothers.\n\"I know that recovery lies ahead,\" she continued. \"I  _  that\nif we were the ones chosen to endure  this  _  , then God will give us the\ngrace to endure. The  _  of our city has given\nbirth to a spirit of unity.\"\n\"My hope isn't  _  on my circumstances,\" she continued. \"My hope is based\non my  _  to hope. Hope is a\nchoice.\"\nThe only thing Brenda could  _  was her attitude. She made a\ndecision to thrive , not just  _  .",
