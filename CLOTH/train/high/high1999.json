It always tried to  _  more load and walk fast in front of the washer man. Innocent Donkey-B was  _  , so it would walk normally, regardless of(/) the washer man's preference.  _  a period of time, the washer man started urging Donkey-B to be like Donkey-A. Donkey-B, unable to walk fast, got continuous  _  from the washer man. It cried and said personally to Donkey-A, \"Dear friend, only we two are here, why do we have to  _  with each other? We can carry  _  load at normal speed. That made Donkey-A more energetic and it told the washer man that it could carry more load and  _  faster. The washer man started  _  Donkey-B to make it run faster. During the following days, Donkey-A carried more load and started running even faster. But it was hard for Donkey-B to  _  that way. The washer man was disappointed,  _  he punished Donkey-B terribly, and finally it fell down  _  . Then the load of Donkey-B was also being  _  by Donkey-A, and still it had to run fast. Finally due to great tiredness it got tired and started feeling the  _  . But the washer man  _  more from Donkey-A. It tried its best, but couldn't  achieve  his owner's expectations. The washer man got angry with Donkey-A and started  _  it to take more load. But it couldn't come to the owner's  _  . Finally the day came when due to disappointment the washer man killed Donkey-A and began  searching for  some other donkeys. Think all colleagues are just the same and that everyone is  _  . Don't feel happy when your colleague is under pressure.",
