He said he had\njust come from the airport without a  _  , which was basically $70 in lost fare.\nOver the course of that ride, the anger slowly   died down   .He mentioned he had read an article\nsaying the  _  people are the ones that give, so he hoped he'd have\nmore  _  to give in his life. I was starting to  _  being\nwith him!

But I pulled out an extra $20 and said,\n\"Since we've been talking about giving this whole time, I wanted to share that  _  with you. I've already paid my fare, but here's an extra little bit. You can  _  it, since you're already down $70 from the airport. But if you want to\nexperience the  _  of the gift, then tell the next passenger in this taxi\nthat their ride is a gift from another and they can  _  their gratitude\nin whatever way.\"\nThe man turned toward me, tears in his eyes, and said, \"Sir, I have a better  _  . You give\nthat $20 to a  _  person around here and I'll treat the next passenger\nwith a  _  ride myself.\"\nWow. This man was   _  10 minutes ago.
