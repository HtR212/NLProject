    "article": "This is a real life story of the engineers building the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, USA back in 1870. The bridge was completed in 1883, after 13 years. In 1869, a creative engineer named John Roebling was  _  by an idea to build a spectacular bridge  _  New York with the Long Island.  _  , bridge-building experts throughout the world thought that this was impossible and told Roebling to forget the idea. Roebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. After much discussion and persuasion he  _  to convince his son Washington, an up and coming engineer, that the bridge  in fact  could be built. The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway, a tragic accident took the life of John Roebling. Washington was also injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage, which  resulted in  him not being able to talk or walk.  In spite of  his handicap, Washington was never discouraged and still had a burning  _  to complete the bridge and his mind was still as  _  as ever. He didn't want to  give up  . Suddenly an idea  _  him. All he could do was move one  _  and he decided to make the best use of it. By moving this, he  _  developed a code of communication with his wife. For 13 years Washington tapped out his  _  with his finger on his wife's arm, until the bridge was finally completed. Today the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge stands for his determination not to be  _  by circumstances. It stands too as a monument to the love and  _  of his wife who for 13 years long  _  decoded the messages of her husband and told the engineers what to do. Perhaps this is one of the best examples of a never-say-die attitude that overcomes a terrible physical handicap and achieves a(n)  _  goal. Often when we face obstacles in our day-to-day life, our hurdles seem very small in comparison to what many others have to face. The Brooklyn Bridge shows us that  _  that seem impossible can be realized with determination and persistence , no matter what the  _  are.",
