Her  _  , out-of-date swimsuit was two sizes too big. She struggled to reach the end of the pool. Always  _  and always being passed by the better-trained girls. The other girls would  wait for  their friends to climb out of the pool, giggle and run back to the starting areas.  _  nobody waited for her. She always walked back to the starting areas  _  .
