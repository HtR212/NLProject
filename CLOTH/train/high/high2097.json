    "article": "Last year, I lived in Chile for half a year. I lived with a Chilean family and had the   _   of any Chilean teenager. I had good days and bad days I didn't understand.\nChuquicamata, my   _   community, is a mining camp. When I arrived there, I was   _  . It was so different from   _   I was used to. There were lots of dogs on the streets, and there was no downtown,   _   smoothly paved streets, and little to do for   _  . Rain was not seen very often; earthquakes and windstorms were   _  .\nI had studied   _   for two and a half years and was always one of the best students in my class. But in my first week in Chile I was only able to communicate and needed one person to whom I could explain my   _  . I couldn't   _   the thoughts in my head and there were so many.\nMost exchange students experience this like me. Culture shock   _   itself in everything from increased aggression   towards the people   _   lack of appetite . I was   _   to overcome all difficulties.\nAs time passed, everything changed. I began to   _   words in English and to   _   in Spanish and love Chilean food. I got used to not   depending on   expensive things for fun.   _   in Chuquicamata was being with people. And I took math, physics, chemistry, biology, Spanish, art, and philosophy.\n  _   the sacrifices were nothing   compared to   the gain. I learned how to   _   and to succeed in another culture. I now have a deeper understanding of both myself and others.",
