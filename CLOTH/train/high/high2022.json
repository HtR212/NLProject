    "article": "A few years ago the company I work for sent my wife and me to live in New York for a year. I've always loved   _   in the morning, so I was really   _   when I found out the house they had bought for us was next to Central Park. This meant that every   _   I could go for a run before I went to work.\n  _   a lot of people had told me to be careful of robbers  in the park, I didn't usually take anything with me. How could they   _   me if I didn't have anything? But this one morning my wife asked me to   _   some bread on the way home so I put a $10 note in my back pocket.\nWhile I was running through the   _  , another runner nearly knocked me over. He apologized and   _   running. I thought it was a little   _   so I checked my   _   and found that the money was missing. I   _   started to run after him. I   _   caught up and caught him by the arm. I started   _   and demanding  that he give me the $10. I'm not   _   a hot-headed person but I really lost my temper  that day. This seemed to   _   him and he quickly put his hand into his pocket and   _   me the money. Then he ran away as   _  as he could.\nI bought the   _   and went home. As soon as I got there I began to tell my wife my   _   \"You won't believe what happened to me,\" I started. She immediately   _   me, \"I know, you left the money for the bread on the kitchen table.\"",
