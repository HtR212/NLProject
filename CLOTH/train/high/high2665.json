    "article": "For many people, being without any electronic devices   creates an uneasy feeling. I recently experienced a weekend without   _  . Allow me to share my   _  .\nLast month, my family and I drove to my aunt Nan's home. My aunt was preparing to move closer to us. The   _   of our visit was to help her pack her belongings. During the ride, my dad   _   us that Aunt Nan's style of living was   _  . We wouldn't hear cell phones ring because signals for electronic devices are not   _   in the mountains. My dad also told us that Aunt Nan had a television, but it   _   few channels.My mother added that my aunt doesn't own a computer and that I would need to write my English paper on Aunt Nan's typewriter.\nOnce we finally   arrived at   Aunt Nan's house, we packed household items. Very quickly, however, I realized that it was   _   to figure out what to do in my free moments. I was used to watching television or movies in my   _   time. I was becoming restless  .\nI'm sure that adults you know   _   tell you stories about the games they played and how they had time to think quietly when they were our age.Our parents grew up in a time when electronic devices were not advanced,   _   instant communication with friends and family wasn't even possible.\nOnce the packing was   _  , there seemed to be nothing else to do. All the quiet thinking time made me   _  , so I began writing my English paper. The old typewriter was fun to use, but I had to be a lot more   _   about making typing mistakes since there was no delete key. The best part of   _   the typewriter was hearing the sound that the keys made.\nI soon finished my paper. My   _   had time to hike, draw, and make unusual crafts -- much like my parents did. The   _   of putting these ideas on paper made me think that our dependence on electronics has   _   our creativity. I challenge you to spend a day without   turning on   any electronic devices. Maybe you will discover the benefit of thinking quietly as well.",
