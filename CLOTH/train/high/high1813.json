    "article": "My oldest child, Emma, just returned to campus after a long holiday break to finish up her last period of   _  . These days, friends and family have begun   _   me with one question: What is she going to do after   _  ?\nThe job market is, after all, awfully   _  . Just this month the Federal Reserve Bank   published   a study showing that \"recent graduates are   _   working in low-paid jobs or working part-time.\" The   _   spot, according to the study, is for students who majored  in STEM-- science, technology, engineering and   _  -- areas in which recent graduates \"have  _   to do relatively well\".\nBut Emma is a student of the humanities  at a small college. She's an American Studies major with a(an)   _   on the politics and culture of food. For quite a while, I think her field of study is so fashionable right now that I'm not the least bit   _   she will find a good job. Yet the more I've thought about it, the more I've decided to be honest. \"I'm not sure what Emma is going to do,\" I now say. \"But she's gotten a great education and has really found her   _  . -- and I know those things will serve her well over the   _   of her life.\"\nNowadays, more and more universities and colleges are being   _   by the salaries of their recent graduates. In this climate,   _   your kid to study the humanities, seems, at best, unwise or, at worst, unconcerned with   _   a living. But a college is not a vocational  school. And promoting STEM subjects should not be society's only answer to helping the next generation grow in a competitive world.\nFrom the beginning, we never urged Emma to   _   a college or a major with an eye on its expected return on money,   _   more and more families are doing. To Emma, what really   _   will be something that we may not be able to measure for quite a long time: Emma's   _   to the world and how happy she is in it.",
