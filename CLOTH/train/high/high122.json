    "article": "Childish Voice When I was a young child, my parents often told me that it was time to teach a man everything. I didn't understand and wondered why  _  had such a big influence  _  .But now,  _  I come to knock at the door of adulthood, I feel  _  to express my own  _  on this saying. I know that I'm just a high school student with very  few  experiences. There are still many things  waiting for  me in the future, yet I would like to express myself in a childish voice. I once read this sentence: \"To make this world a happy place to live, you'd better  _  yourself and your heart , instead of the whole world.\" I was shocked. It made me think about life  _  . There are so many things around us that  go against  our will. We can't force life  to follow  our wishes. The earth won't stop turning no matter whether we  _  it or not. What we can do is just to make ourselves  suit  the world. I think we should learn to accept  _  life gives us, no matter whether it's the spring sunlight or the winter snowfall, and try to be happy. Deeply moved by the pop song Grandmother (by Jay Chou), I always try to  _  every pleasant thing in my life, but now I see I don't catch most of the pleasant moments. It is more  _  that they slip by and leave you feeling  _  . I realize that I'm not just living  _  myself and that there are the others around me I should think of .They all pay attention to my growing up, even if it's just a little progress. Everyone has his or her own attitude towards life, be it positive or  _  .It doesn't matter, I think. There is one  _  that should be obeyed--and that's to make this world better.",
