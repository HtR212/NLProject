    "article": "There are four possible birth order positions within a family. A child may be the oldest, the youngest or the  _  child, or an only child   _  no brothers or sisters. Birth order theory says that our birth order influences what kind of person we each  _   .\nChildren in each birth position have a   _  way to gain an advantage in the family. The oldest children often get more time with their parents. They always try to be    _   and do everything correctly. The youngest children are used to other people providing for them. They may be more   _  about themselves than about other people. As for middle children, they can sometimes feel left out, since they don't get the   _  of being the oldest or the youngest. Some middle children become competitive and even rebel against   their parents.   _  many of them make peace in the family.\nThe last birth order position is only children. With no brothers or sisters they often   _  whatever they want! They don't have any    _  for their parents' time or resources. Only children often use language very well  _   they spend so much time with adults. They can also feel a lot of   _  as only children, which can make them competitive and hardworking.\nSome people    _   that birth order theory describes them very well. Other people say the theory doesn't   _  . There are many other different   _   that may change the effects of birth order on personality. These variables   _    the sex and age of each child and the number of brothers and sisters. Culture and education  _  make a difference. So does the amount of money that the  _  has. The experiences of the family can also change how birth order affects    _   .\nAs family expert Frank Sulloway says, \"Humans are complex. But that doesn't mean birth order isn't   _  we can learn from.\"",
