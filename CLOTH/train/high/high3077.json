I   pulled into   a small parking lot. Then I   _   the doors and picked up my phone to call a tow truck  . Soon a man   _   on my driver's side window and asked if he could help me. From his   _   and behavior, I knew he was far more   _   to rob   than help me, so I   _  refused and told him the tow truck was due any minute. He asked again, but again I gently shook my head. He finally said, \" Ma'am, you need   _  . A tow truck in Houston will arrive anywhere between 45 minutes and approximately   _  (which I knew was true), and you are not going anywhere until you have that tire  _  .\"\nI looked hard, straight into his   _  , and instinctively   saw someone different from the   _   person he appeared to be at first glance. So, against all reasonable   _  , but trusting my instincts, I got out. He looked  _  , but got right to work, trying to find the   _   tire. It took a while since it was stored under the van  .\nHe changed the tire,   _   the seat to its place and said, \"Thank you for letting me help you. You gave me a   _   when most people would never open the door to someone like me. Would it be okay if I gave you a hug?\" When I  _  , I gave him a giant hug. I left with a new tire and a renewed   _   in human nature.",
