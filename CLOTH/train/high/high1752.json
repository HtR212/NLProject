When Hoover, my drama teacher, was  _  in Alaska, I didn't want her to feel like she was ending her life  _  , so I sent her many packages, including Drama Club yearbook photos from each year she  _  there in order that she could see the students whose lives she forever  _  . Her nickname for our group of Drama Club was \"the Throwaway Kids\".  _  , no? She described us as that  _  we were nonconformists that other teachers didn't  _  know what to do with. She simply  _  us for who we are, and that was exactly what we needed. We have all become  _  members of society: reporters, lawyers, and singers, soldiers, doctors and, you guessed it, teachers. Every member of my family is a teacher. This year  marks  the 73rd year we have taught in Alaska altogether.  _  me, teaching the course is only one important part of the  _  job. As I returned to my classroom just before the final bell  _  on the last day of school in May, I thought how the most emotional part of the experience will not be seeing the recent  _  return to say \"hello\" at Christmas.
