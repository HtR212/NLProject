    "article": "A Housing Authority is a government agency that has apartments for old people in the U.S. and I work for one. My job is to do an activity once a  _  with their senior citizens. Sometimes we do a craft, play bingo,  _  watch a movie, etc. We always have snacks, and once a month we have a lunch.\nToday we had a Christmas potluck  _  . \"Potluck\" means everyone brings some kind of  _  to share. A true potluck is not planned - everyone just brings something and you all  _   whatever is on the table! However, I planned this one  _  . I brought spaghetti, meatballs and bread, just in case people didn't bring much.  _  they didn't have much money, I worried that maybe they wouldn't  _  much food.\nWell, everything went very  _  ! We had different kinds of food and people also brought coffee and tea. Everyone was  _  ! And I gave them each a pretty present they all  _  .\nSome old people who live there are very  _  and cannot come out of their apartments. When we have a big lunch, we  make up  some food for them and take it to them after the party. They are always so happy to get  _   .\nSome of these people hardly go  _  . For some of them, they only go out if they have to go to the  _  or go food shopping. So this one-day-a-week activity of socializing and  _  these people is very  _  , as some have no family around.\nI don't get  _  much for doing this job. It's only part-time, but it makes me feel so good that I just can't  _  doing it. I suppose I'll do everything I can to make sure the program continues!",
