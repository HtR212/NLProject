    "article": "Once, my father and I were waiting to buy tickets for the circus. Finally, there was only one family   _  us and the counter, who made a big  _  on\nme. There were eight children, all probably under 12. You could  _  they weren't rich. Their clothes weren't expensive but  _  . The children were well-behaved, standing in line behind their parents and  _  talking about what they would see that night.\nOne could   _  they had never been to the circus before. The mother was holding her\nhusband's hand while the father was smiling in  _  .\nThe ticket lady asked the father how many tickets he wanted. He proudly  _  , \"Eight for children and two for adults, please.\"\nThe ticket lady told him the price. The man's wife let go of   _  hand, her\nhead dropped, and his lip began to tremble. The father leaned a little  _  and asked, \"How much did you say?\"\nThe ticket lady   _  the price. The man didn't have enough money.  _  was\nhe supposed to turn and tell his kids that he didn't have enough  _  to take them to the circus? Seeing this, my father put his hand in\nhis pocket,  pulled out  a $20 bill and dropped it on the\nground. Then my father  _  down, picked up the\nbill and said to the man, \"Excuse me, sir, this fell out of your pocket.\"\nThe man knew what was going on. He wasn't begging for it but certainly   _  the\ntimely help in such an  _  situation. He took my\nfather's  _  in both of his, squeezed tightly onto the   _  , and with a tear running down his cheek, he replied, \"Thank you, sir. This\nreally  _  a lot to me and my family.\"",
