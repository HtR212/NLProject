I have been   _  at the Boston Children's Hospital every year since I was thirteen. At the beginning, I only wanted to go because I would get praise for entertaining children at the   _  . After giving my time for two months, my opinion changed completely.\nWhen I first   _   into the waiting room on the ground floor, I was very   _   that I would be spending my entire summer with kids. As it became routine for me to show up every day at 8 a.m., many kids began to   _   me. To my surprise, I began looking forward to seeing their   _   faces as well. They were always enthusiastic about   _  . My heart warmed every time I heard their   _   voices asking me for a story or an answer to a question. I felt   _   and irreplaceable  .\nAs I look back, I see the   _   that these special children have had on me. It is because of them that I have   _   a desire to become a psychologist. Recently, I have volunteered for a month. I have been asked to   help out   on many different floors besides the waiting room where I started. The kids on the floors above are usually there for a longer time. Despite their anxiety and desire to get better and go home, they always offer me a(n)   _   smile. I feel renewed after spending a day with them because I realize that there is much more to   _   than money. It is much more important to love and to be loved.",
