    "article": "Recently I paid a visit to Harvard University, where there are top class scientists and professors and the best academic system in the world. I was very  _  when I first stepped onto the campus . Well, it's not even really a campus. It's  _  like an area in a small town. Harvard's main buildings are from the 18th century.They look very old and  _  . You might  _  say they're a little shabby . They don't fit the modern  _  of university at all. The buildings are surrounded by  _  and trees, so I felt as if I had walked into a castle of the Mid-Ages. But when I looked across the street, the  _  shops and in-fashion students made me feel like I was in the 21st century  _  . It creates a strong contrast and brings a special  _  to the school. Our tents  _  Gary took us around told us.\"You see this grass field in the center of the school?Here is where they hold their  _  ceremony .They just set up tents and benches and have a very simple ceremony.\" It's  unbelievable  ! Who would think the most talented students just graduate on the grass? I  _  some students put a blanket on the grass and lie down to read a book. When I listened to the soft sound of  _  turning, along with the singing of the birds, I felt very  _  .There was no competitive felling at all. Harvard has the world's first computer in its science centre  _  there are hundreds of high-end computers, too. Its religion and the literature departments are also  _  the best. It is the perfect mix of tradition and  _  technology.It makes Harvard a very attractive place to  _  in. I hope one day I'll  _  my dream school --- Harvard.",
