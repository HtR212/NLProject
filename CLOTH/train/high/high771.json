    "article": "Times were tough in our household. My husband was out of work and there was no sign of anything  _  for him. In addition to going to nursing school full-time, I was working three part-time jobs   _  to put food on the table for our family of five.\nAfter a rather  _   meal one night, I answered the ringing phone. With no  _  , a voice asked, \"Do you need food? Come to my place and I can help you.\" Directions followed and he hung up the phone. No in-depth conversation or queries as to our   _  situation. It was up to us to decide whether we   _   a voice on the telephone.\nI was desperate. With   _   food in the cabinet and no prospect of a job for my husband, I had to take a    _   , swallow my pride, and accept the strange offer. Was there a   _   ?  When I uneasily got to a ranch home as  _   ,I found there was no car in the garage.   _   , lined up in orderly rows were tables filled with varieties of food. A craggy gentleman   _   me, not much different than our phone conversation! \"Look around. If you see what you want,   _   yourself.\" He handed me paper bags and turned to another new arrival, passing along the same   _  .This couldn't be real!\nI guiltily filled the paper sacks with what   _   needed and gratefully thanked the elderly man. \"Be here next week. You'll   run out  of the food by then\" was his reply.\nThen I learned the thing. Widowed and retired, he wanted to do something   _  in his golden years to fill his time. Daily, he drove his pickup truck and begged for   _  items and canned goods from local grocery stores and   _  folks like us who had fallen on hard times.\nI never knew what our weekly menus would be   _  I had \"shopped\" in the garage, but I knew, with our bellies full, we could focus on paying necessary bills.",
