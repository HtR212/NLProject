    "article": "An ordinary teacher named Pan Shanji has moved China by devoting the past 34 years as an educator who has been  passing on  his knowledge to children with few other  _  for schooling. Pan Shanji has  _  about 200 students over his 34-year teaching  _  , and although not one of them  _  it to college, he is very proud of all of them. \"My students are the first group of people from three local villages who have dared to leave the mountains to look for jobs,\" Pan, 53, says  _  .\nPan, a member of the Mulam ethnic group , is the only teacher for 12 students  _  from 6 to 9 years old in the mountainous Dayandong village of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. He teaches many subjects,  _  Chinese, math, sports, painting and music.\nAs far as the three villages are concerned, they are the most  _  in Guzhai town. In the 1940s, their ancestors  _  to the mountains to avoid the Japanese invasion  and  _  there. The average annual income per family is less than 1,000 yuan ($159). They plant some crops on the farmland in valleys and  _  a self-sufficient life.\nPan is the first high school  _  in Dayandong village, which makes him feel  _  for helping the illiterate villagers.\n\"I have four younger sisters who  gave up  their only chance of schooling for me. My father lost his chance to  _  the army because of illiteracy  in the 1950s. In the early 1970s, when he worked as a temporary worker at a local railway construction site, he often cried at night  _  because he missed home but could not  _  home for three years and he was too shy to ask for help. So I tried my best at school and realized that writing is  _  for us.\"\nPan told the media that he will stay in the village and do  _  he can to help the children because they are the future of the village.",
