    "article": "On a hot summer day in late August, I sought shade and a cool drink at a waterfront cafe on a Greek island. Over a hundred degrees in  _  air. Crowded. Tempers of both the tourists and waiters had  _  to meet the situation, making it a rather quarrelsome environment At the table next to mine sat an attractive,  _  couple, waiting for  _  . They held hands, whispered, kissed, and laughed. Suddenly they stood, picked up their  metal table  and stepped together  _  the edge of where they were sitting to place the table in the sea water. The man stepped  _  for the two chairs. He politely  _  his lady in the knee-deep water and then sat down himself. All people around laughed and cheered.  A waiter  appeared. He paused for just a second, walked into the water to  _  the table and take their  _  , and then walked back to the  _  cheers of the rest of his  _  . Minutes later he returned carrying a bottle of wine and two glasses. Without pausing, he went  once more  into the water to  _  the wine. The couple toasted each other, the waiter and the crowd. And the crowd  _  by cheering and throwing flowers to them. Three other tables  joined in  to have lunch in the water. The place was now filled with laughter. One doesn't step into water in one's best summer clothes. Why not? Customers are not served  in the sea  . Why not? Sometimes one should consider  _  the line of convention and enjoy  _  to the fullest.",
