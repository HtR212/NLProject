    "article": "Jerry was 15 when I was only 10, but the fact that he was so much older than I seemed to make no difference to him. We took long walks together, on which he would tell stories he had   picked up  from TV and radio programs. I suppose he changed the plots a lot and\nadded twists of  _  own, but he knew what would  _  the\nlively imagination of a 10-year-old.\nJerry never seemed to   _  giving me so much of his time and,  _  he had many\nold friends, he always made me feel that I was his  _  one.\nHe taught me all I  _  know about birds and flowers; he came\nover to read to me every day when I had to stay home for weeks with my leg\nbroken. I  _  came to feel Jerry meant more to me than either\nmy father or mother did, and began to  look up to  him as I would have\nto a god.\nBut as months rolled by,   a change  came in our relationship. Jerry  _  stopped coming\nby the house and every time I went to his or telephoned him, he put me off with\nsome  _  such as studying now. I noticed him with a girl once  _  a while and several times saw him going out in his family's car on\nweekends. I simply couldn't understand  _  was so great about\ngirls, parties and big social affairs.\nBut what I could understand was my   _  when he finally made me know that our  _  as\nfriends was at the end.  Of course  he didn't really mean to hurt me,\nbut it was a long time before I realized it was  an age  problem\nthat caused the break. There's a world of difference between the attitudes and\ninterests of a teenger and a 12-year-old.  Now that  I'm over 16\nmyself, I realize this and the hurt I felt then has  _  way\nto happy memories of the good times we once had together.",
