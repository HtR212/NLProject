Arran Fernandez, who was  _  at home by his father, Neil, will  _  a mathematics degree at Fitzwilliam College next month and he hopes to have a career as a research mathematician to  work out  the Riemann hypothesis that has confused the brightest minds. It will make him the youngest Cambridge student  _  14-year-old William Pitt the Younger studied there in 1773. Last night the child genius said: \"I am looking forward to going to the  _  . I have started the first-year books  _  and it is all right, not too  _  . I can understand it. I am excited about going to Cambridge,  _  I am used to making records about being the youngest in education. It isn't the youngest moment that is so important to me--  _  I'm more interested in going to Cambridge than comparing  _  with other people who go there.\" But  because of  his age he will not be able to  join in  many of the alcohol-fuelled festivities traditionally  _  to Freshers' Week. \"I don't think I'm missing too much fun,\" he insisted. \"Even if I was 18, I wouldn't want to go out  _  . \" Arran,  _  plans to join the bird-watching society instead and go boating while at university, was five when he  _  the youngest person to be  _  a GCSE (General Certificated of Secondary Education), after passing maths. He was offered the  _  to learn at Cambridge in 2010, when he was 14, on the condition he gained an A-level in physics, which he  _  with an A+ grade. Arran had already gained an A grade in further maths last year. Cambridge also asked him to attend three GCSEs in subjects which were not related to maths and physics to  _  his knowledge. He gained A+s in English literature and French and an A in English language this summer.",
