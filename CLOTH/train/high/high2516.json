While two old beggars were sitting on a  _  street corner, they watched helplessly as scores of people walked by. Some purposely  _  them and others too caught up in their own cares didn't even notice their  _  . Every so often, a kind-hearted woman or a small child would drop a few coins in the  _  which lay in front of them. As the crowd began to die down, they started to  pack up  their things and head for their evening  _  . Just as they were getting ready to leave, they noticed a man walking toward them. He was obviously a  _  man--they could tell that from his finely tailored business suit.

However, into his fingers fell a shiny white pearl worth thousands of dollars.",
