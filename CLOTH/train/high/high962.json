    "article": "Just three weeks after landing back in the UK, I was determined to quit my job. Hearing my   _  , my family were strongly against it. But I was   _  about going back to Ghana to set up more play centres and   _   people to use their local resources.\nBut a few of my friends   _   me-some even ran marathons to raise money for my   _  . They also paid to see me sing at a concert I put on to raise funds.\nIn the months before my   _   Africa trip, I spent all my free time   _   early childhood development-I wanted to know the best way to teach these children. In January 2012, a year after I first   _  as a volunteer teacher, having raised $1,000, I   _   to Ghana.\nThere I met David, a community development worker who   _  my play centre idea. He took me to a remote village on his motorbike and introduced me to village elders who helped me organize community meetings to tell   _   about my plans.\nI lived in a mud hut with a few   _  from a village in northern Ghana. I commissioned  local carpenters to   _   wooden games and asked friends in Tamale to   _  cardboard boxes, bottle tops and buttons for them.\nIt took David and I nearly three months to train teenage volunteers from villages, but this was extremely   _  to me, as I wanted the   _   to be running their own communities. At the end of the training we held a graduation ceremony and   _   120 children at the centre, where toys, puzzles and charts were used as  _   to help children learn. The volunteers started using their training to   _  teach the children each afternoon.\nThe kids at the first centre were so   _   to finally learn how to count and identify colours. All three centres were set up using the money I raised in the UK.",
