    "article": "Many people now think that teachers give pupils too much homework. They say that it is  _  for children to work at home in their free time.  _  , they argue that most teachers do not  _  plan the homework tasks they give to pupils. The result is that pupils have to  _  tasks which they have already done at school. Recently in Greece, many parents  _  about the difficult homework which teachers gave to their children. The parents said that most of the homework was a waste of time, and they wanted to  _  it. Spain and Turkey are two countries which stopped homework recently. In Denmark, Germany and several other countries in Europe, teachers cannot  _  homework at weekends. In Holland, teachers allow pupils to stay at school to do their homework. The children are  _  to help one another. Similar  _  also exists in some British schools. Most people agree that homework is not  _  . A pupil who can do his homework in a quiet and  _  room is in a much better position than a pupil who does his homework in a small, noisy room with the television on. Some parents help their children with their homework. Other parents take no  _  at all in their children's homework.",
