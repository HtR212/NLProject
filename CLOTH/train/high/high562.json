    "article": "A farmer had some puppies to  _  . He painted a sign advertising the puppies and  set about  nailing it to a post on the edge of his yard. As he was driving the last nail into the post, a little boy came to him. \"Mister,\" he said, \"I want to buy one of your puppies.\" \"Well,\" said the farmer, as he  _  the sweat off his face, \"these puppies come from fine parents and cost  a great deal of  money. Do you have enough money?\" The boy  _  his head for a moment. Then reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a handful of  _  and held it up to the farmer. \"I've got thirty-nine cents. Is that enough to take a look?\" \"Sure,\" said the farmer. And with that he  let out  ), \"Here, Dolly!\" he called.  _  from the doghouse and down the ramp ran Dolly  _  by four little balls of fur. The little boy' eyes danced with delight. As the dogs made their  _  to the fence, the little boy noticed something else stirring inside the doghouse.  _  another little ball appeared; this one noticeably smaller. Then in a somewhat  _  manner the little pup began hobbling toward the others, doing its best to  catch up  . \"I want that one,\" the little boy said,  _  to the smallest one. The farmer said, \"Son, you don't want that puppy. He will never be able to run and play with you  _  these other dogs would.\" With that the little boy  _  back from the fence, and began  _  up one leg of his trousers. In doing so he exposed a steel support running down both sides of his leg  attaching  itself to a specially made  _  . Looking back up at the farmer, he said, \"You see sir, I don't  _  too well myself, and he will need someone who understands.\"",
