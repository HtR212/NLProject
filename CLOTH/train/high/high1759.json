I wasn't working that summer and was  _  only two classes in summer school, so I had some  _  time. Three nights a week, I  _  in the kitchen of the shelter along with four other volunteers. We planned and  _  for 45 people hot meals  _  vegetables, chicken, fish and fruit. The homeless people  _  this good food because many of them usually didn't eat well. I  _  this volunteer work, making  _  with the four volunteers in the kitchen. One was a very nice elderly housewife, one a movie actor, another a young teacher, and the other a college student,  _  me. I talked to a lot of the homeless people at the shelter. Their life stories  _  me with sympathy . Some of them had  _  with alcohol or drugs while others only had bad  _  . One woman worked for almost 30 years for a small company, and  _  she lost her job. She looked for a  _  job, but couldn't find one, for she was too  _  . She could do nothing but sell her furniture -- sofas, chairs, and tables  so that  she could pay for her food. The woman  _  on job hunting, but she  _  couldn't find one.
