I gave the book to my father to read, and within a day he left me a voice mail saying that it was   _   and that I was going to sell it for $300,000.\n  _  , and rather quickly, the book was   _   by every publisher in New York. If there were a literary prize for Most Rejections, I would have won it. I was   _  , of course, but I knew better than to   _   -- writing wasn't an easy job, and if this book wasn't my 44 _  in, maybe the next one would be. I got back to work.\nBut this scenario  happened again: I wrote books...and then they wouldn't       _  . Still, my father's faith in me never wavered , even   _   I worked a host of other jobs. Some of the jobs, like being a bookseller, were great and   _   to my writing life. Some, like selling overpriced jeans to 12-year-olds, were only good insofar as they were material for future   _  . And they were -- because it finally   _  . I sold a book! I was going to make it big!\nI completely agree with motivational speaker and author John Maxwell's words: \"Successful and unsuccessful people do not   _   greatly in their abilities but in their       _   to reach their potential.\" Life's not   _  . It never was, it isn't now, it won't ever be. But do not fall into the entitlement trap of feeling you are a   _  , you are not. Get over it and   get on   with it. And yes, most things are more   _   when you break a sweat to get them.",
