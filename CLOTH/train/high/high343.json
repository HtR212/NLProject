This means different things  _  on the animal and the situation.  _  a wild animal, being kind may mean staying far away  _  the animal doesn't feel threatened and so you stay  _  .\nStepping outside can mean a world full of great animals to see --  from  squirrels in trees to birds in flight. In some parts of the world, kids  may  see slithery snakes, black bats,  _  even cool coyotes. And don't forget raccoons, skunks, and other critters  _  come out in some places at night.\nThe rule in the great outdoors is simple: Don't  _  or go near an animal.  _  some of these animals may look cool or even cute, leave them  _  . These animals aren't like regular pets. They're not  used  to being around people and may bite or attack if you come near them. They also might have rabies .\nDon't ever try to  _  a wild animal. Bird feeders are OK, but other animals,  even if  they look hungry, shouldn't ever be fed. When it comes to these animals, it's better for everyone if you stay   _  and check them out at the zoo, on the Internet, on TV nature shows, or in books.\nIf a pet looks sick or is injured, stay far away. An animal that  normally\n<IMG>  loves to be petted may get very  _  and even bite when it is feeling ill. Tell an adult so he or she can get  _  for the animal.",
