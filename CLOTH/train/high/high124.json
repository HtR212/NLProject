Well that's how I  _  about joining Madcaps, a mothers and daughters club assisting philanthropies .But now I believe that you  _  open up your mind to things because eventually you might  _  end up enjoying it. \"It's a waste of time\", I said when my mom told I had to join Madcaps, and then when she said I had to  _  at a homeless shelter I thought this just could not be  _  We got there late, of course, and the security guard led us to the kitchen  _  we ran into 48 other fellow Madcaps members. Since I'm  _  so socially awkward I had met only one person at a pool party, earlier this year. I looked around for her but she was not there. Damn, I was  _  ! When the man in charge came out and asked for 3 mothers to work outside the  _  to clean up the plates, my mom just happened to volunteer leaving me to  _  food with others. Soon the  _  families started to walk in and a little girl walked up and pointed to the food I was  holding out  I gave her the cold sandwich, she nodded in a form of saying  _  , and then walked to join her family at the large table. As she walked away I thought of how much I  _  I get to go the top schools. I have a great house and I have a warm meal every night. It  _  that little girl to make me realize how lucky I am. After that moment I had a change of  _  . Now, I love Madcaps and don't miss one meeting, I have  got over  being socially awkward and now have many friends. And this year I am sure I will do  more than  the required 20 hours of philanthropies. I believe that if you have an  _  mind about things you can accomplish more and become a better rounded person. I believe sometimes you can make a difference just  _  doing one thing you don't want to do .",
