Wind rocked  Leaf to   _   and shook her awake every day, and always told Leaf about the beautiful places he had been,   _   her feel excited.\n\"I will never leave you,   _   you make me happy,\" Leaf whispered to the gentle Wind.\n    When Tree heard these   _   he laughed and said, \" Remember that you will wither , become brown, and be   blown away   by Wind.\"\n    Leaf was   _   to hear this. \"That's a lie!\" she cried. She had heard the stories of   _    leaves turn old and die, but didn't   _   them.\n    Time passed, and Leaf grew bigger and stronger, but then came the period of   _   yellow and old.\n    \"Your   _   has come. You'll be blown away by Wind and become nothing but dust.\"\n    Leaf laughed. \"Your words cannot   _  . Others may be sad,   _   I won't. I choose to be happy with my fate\"\n    Tree was angry, \"You'll regret.\"\n    But one day, when Leaf actually was carried away by Wind, she laughed   _   the air. \"Oh, I'm   _   with Wind!\" Instead of feeling   _  , she felt free. She could   _   the soft song of Wind, and felt herself flying higher and higher.\n    When springtime came again, Leaf passed by Tree and heard him   _   the young leaves about their   _  . But Leaf whispered to them, \"Listen, my children. It doesn't have to be your fate. If you choose to be   _  , you will soar  into the sky. But if you bend to your fate, you will be   _   forever.\"",
