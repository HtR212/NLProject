    "article": "Many years ago three soldiers, hungry and tired of battles, came upon a small village. The villagers,  _  a poor harvest and many years of war, quickly  _  what little they had to eat and met the three at the village square, wringing their clothes and complaining of the  _  shortages. The soldiers spoke quietly among themselves and the first soldier then  turned to  the village elders. \"Your tired fields have left you  _  to share, so we will share what little we have: the  _  of how to make soup from stones.\"  _  the villagers were interested and soon a fire was put to the town's greatest pot as the soldiers dropped three smooth  _  into the pot full of water. \"Now this will be a fine soup,\" said the second soldier, \"but a little salt and some parsley would make it  _  !\" Up jumped a villager, crying \"I've just remembered  _  some have been left!\" She ran away,  _  with the parsley and salt.  _  the water boiled, corn, carrots, beef and cream  _  their way into the pot when all sat  _  to have a large meal. The villagers ate and sang and danced well into the  _  , full of energy again by the meal and their new-found friends. In the next morning the three soldiers  _  up to find the whole village standing before them. At their feet  _  a bag of the village's best bread and cheese. An elder said that the soldiers had given them the  _  gift: the secret of how to make soup from stones and they would never forget. The third soldier turned to the  _  and said, \"There is no secret, but this is certain: it is only by  _  that we may enjoy a large meal.\"",
