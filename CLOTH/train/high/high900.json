    "article": "Many sports players have not only accomplished incredible acts of athleticism , but also unbelievable acts of sportsmanship. There were some   _  examples in 2014, and I have   _  two that inspired me.\nOne example of sportsmanship took place in the Sochi Olympics. Russian Anton Gafarov was hobbling  along the track, far   _   the rest of the skiers. One of his skis  was broken. He had tried to   _   with the damaged equipment. Canadian ski coach Justin Wadsworth was the only one who had an extra. Wadsworth didn't want Gafarov to finish slowly, hobbling across the line. He wanted him to finish with   _  . The Canadian skiers were already out of the race, giving Wadsworth two   _  : Leave Gafarov to hobble across the line on one ski,   _   give him the spare one. Wadsworth gave him the extra ski,   _   Gafarov to get second place in the quarter-finals.   _  , he came in sixth in the semi-finals.   _  was Wadsworth who helped Gafarov complete his Olympic dream.\nThe other example took place in the 2014 World Cup quarter-final match between Brazil and Colombia. The game had just ended. Brazil had won, 2-1. Brazil was   _   on the sidelines, cheering and having a good time. Colombian midfielder James Rodriguez had just had his World Cup dream tore apart   _   scoring a record-breaking six goals in the competition. Brazil defender David Luiz walked over to him, pointed at him, and   _   the crowd to acknowledge him. He then declared his   _   for a game well played and   _   him for his wonderful World Cup performance. It made both the crowd and Rodriquez   _  .\nAs an athlete, I know it's easy to get caught up in the   _   of a game. But I also know that    _   is just as important as losing and winning.\nAlways remember to   shake hands with   your opposing team. Play hard, but play fair. And always be nice. It's the right thing to do and it always   pays off  .",
