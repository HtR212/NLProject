    "article": "For centuries, magicians have used various ways to shock the audience. We all have seen how a  _  performer carefully steps  _  a bed of burning coals -- barefoot. Then he walks across  _  a single burn on his feet. Is it mind over matter, or is it just physics? As it turns  _  , walking on burning coals isn't that hot as  imagined  . \"The coals are hot enough to  _  you, but if you walk quickly across them you  _  being burned.\" says Jonathan Hall, a physician at Penn State University in Eric Pennsylvania. That's because some coals are made  _  burning wood chips. Wood has two  _  properties for fire-walking, explains Hall. First, wood is an insulator --it doesn't  _  heat very well. \"It  _  time for heat to travel  _  the wood to your feet.\" Hall says. If the performer walked across red-hot metal  _  , that would truly be  _  , because metal conducts, or transmits, heat very well. The metal would  _  burn a performer's feet. Second, wood has a low specific heat-- it doesn't take much heat to  _  its temperature. Heat is a form of  _  . Temperature is a  _  of heat, in units of degrees. So  even though  the coals are hot, the value of heat energy they contain is low. Thus, a well-trained performer can  _  such an amazing result. Still, you don't want to walk on burning coals, do you?",
