To be honest, it is  _  how many problems are caused by such little things in the life of a teenager .It has awakened another side of myself  _  me. And it couldn't have happened at a worse time.\nI'm a senior, I'm going to  _  soon and I know what college I'm going to. And now I have to deal with this little voice in my head constantly  _  me that I'm going to be a rock star, not a scientist.\nA few weeks ago I was given the  _  simple task of writing a short story. I sat down to  _  a beautiful work of fiction that would  _  my teacher and classmates. To be honest, this is an area I generally feel very  _  in. I really enjoy it and such writing tasks used to take the  _  amount of time.\nSo I was  _  to write my story, and across the room lay my beautiful birthday present. \"Once upon a time,\" I wrote. Then I stopped,  _  in my chair, and stared for a moment at the  _  . Its dark red paint was  _  and I could see my reflection in its perfect surface. And then my reflection started dancing and singing. I wasn't  _  , but it sure was. I'd follow its  _  . So I seized my guitar and plucked   a string. I sat rocking with my guitar until late  _  the night. I was sure I was preparing for the  _  much more efficiently now that I wasn't spending time writing stories.\nNeedless to say, no story was written, and many  _  arose in my mind. Since then, I have constantly asked, \"Am I  _  for not wanting to do my work anymore?\" More importantly,  _  , I've learned I really am going to be a rock star.",
