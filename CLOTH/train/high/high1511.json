I discovered something I had   _   forgotten, something that happened to me as a child.\nOne night, as I lay in bed   _   my sister and I had said our prayers, I recalled the events of the day and how   _   I had behaved towards Mother. \"I must make things right before going to sleep,\" I thought.\nQuickly I slipped out of bed and picked up a pencil and paper, then tiptoed into the hall. The   _   from the living room shone dimly. I knew Mother was downstairs mending socks.\nI quickly   _   a note asking Mother to forgive me for being so   _  . I didn't want my brothers and sisters to know our   _   so I added a postscript: \"Please don't let anyone see this.\" Then I quietly moved into my parents' bedroom and put the letter under Mother's pillow.\nThe next morning, when I   _   my bed after breakfast, I unexpectedly   _   a note under my pillow. Mother wrote that she loved me and   _   me.\nThis became my way of apologizing whenever I talked back or disobeyed. Mother always left a note, but she never spoke out our under-the-pillow messages in front of the family. Even when we were   _  , she never mentioned them when we brothers and sister recalled our childhood. \nWhen Mother   passed away  , I had to go through her personal belongings. In her desk was a bundle of notes tied with a faded ribbon  . On top was a message in her handwriting. It read, \"In the event of my death, please   _   these.\"\nI   turned over   the packet and glanced at the handwriting on the bottom. To my surprise, I   _   my childish writing, \"P.S. Please don't let anyone see this. Love, Edie.\"\nI gently placed the unopened bundle in the wastebasket along with other things for the rubbish burner. \"Lord,\" I prayed, \"make me like my mother.\"",
