Life has   _  for\nmillions of teenagers across the world who now make friends online.  _  you use chat rooms, QQ, MSN or ICQ, you are  _  of\na virtual community .\n\"I rarely talk with my parents or grandparents,    _  I talk a lot with my old friends\non QQ,\" said Fox's Shadow, the online nickname used by a Senior 2 girl in China. \"Eighty per cent of my classmates use QQ    _  school.\"\nQQ is the biggest messaging    _  in China. A record 4 million people used it on\nSaturday nights in October,  _  to Tencent, the company which\ndeveloped QQ.\nAnd Fox's Shadow might well have been one of them. \"I log in   on Friday nights, and Saturdays or Sundays when I feel   _  . I usually  _  about 10 hours chatting online every\nweek,\"she said. \"But I rarely talk with  _  , especially\nboys or men.\"\nEven though she likes chatting, she is careful about making    _  with strangers online.\n\"You don't know  _  you're talking to. You should  _  be careful about who you trust online.\"\nMany people would like to meet offline when they feel they have got to   _  someone \nvery well. Fox's Shadow once met one of her online friends face to face. It was\na girl who was a comic fan like  herself  and they went to a comic\nshow together.\nHowever, not all teenagers have been so   _  . At the beginning of this year, a 17-year-old girl was\nkilled after meeting a friend she had found on QQ. The criminals weren't  _  until last month.\nA 16-year-old Beijing boy, known online as Bart Simon, dislikes QQ users. \"I used to chat on QQ, but I found that most people were talking   _  ,\" he said. Now he\nchats online in English, using MSN. But he spends little time chatting as he\nsees it as a  _  of time and money. \"If you are really  _  to it, sometimes you just can't cocentrate in class,\" he said.",
