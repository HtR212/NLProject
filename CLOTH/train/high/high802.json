    "article": "My father and I disagreed about curfew . He'd say I was to be in by 9:30 on weekdays, and 11:00 on weekends, no exceptions without my first asking. I told him it made me  _  like a juniorhigh kid. He explained that while a curfew  _  sound like a restriction, it's really about people looking out for one another. The very next Friday after that pretty heated  _  , my dad and I had tickets to see our town's professional football game. On that day he was  _  to a nearby city to meet with some major clients and  _  me that his getting home and our leaving for the game would be tight. To make sure we could  _  off the moment he walked in, I got everything prepared. When a half hour had passed from the time he said he'd be home, I understood that he was a little  _  . But then, nearly a whole hour passed. I was getting  _  . We were going to miss the kickoff! And why hadn't he  _  me and let me know he was going to be really late? As I anxiously  _  the floor, another half hour passed. That's when I got really angry. How inconsiderate of my father! Now we were going to  _  the whole game! When yet another half hour passed, my anger turned to  _  . What if something terrible had happened to my dad, like he had a heart attack or had been in an accident, or something? I began to really  _  . I'd already called his cellphone about ten times, but no  _  . I was beside myself, assuming the worst had happened. Finally, the phone rang, and my dad said  _  , \"Son, I'm so sorry about the game, but...there was a terrible accident...on the freeway coming home, and I  _  to help... and ended up going to the hospital. I  _  my cellphone in the car, so I couldn't call until now.\" I was so relieved to hear from my father and to  _  that he was safe that I actually cried. That was  _  I \"got\" the importance of a curfew: Checking in! It's about knowing that someone you love is  _  . It was one more proof of my father's loving me as much as he does.",
