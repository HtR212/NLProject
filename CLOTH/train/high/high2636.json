I'll sit  next to  the boy who's the best at  _  ,\" Henry thought, \"and  _  his answers.\" The day of the exam  _  , and Henry sat next to Allan,  _  was  _  at the top of the class in math. Henry copied Allan's answers  _  his own exam paper. At the end of the exam, the teacher said, \"Well, boys and girls, I've decided to give a red  _  to the student who got the  _  grade. It's  _  for me to decide who I'll give the star to, however,  _  two students, Henry and Allan, got the  _  grade.\" After a moment she went on, \"  _  I've decided to give the star to  _  this time.\" Henry was  _  when he heard this. He stood  _  and said, \"But I got the same grade as Allan, madam.\" \"That's  true  .\" The teacher said. \"However, Allan's answer to Question 6 was 'I don't know.', but  _  was 'Nor do I.' .\"",
