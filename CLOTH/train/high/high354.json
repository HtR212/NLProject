Habitat, a United Nations agency.\n  A century ago,   _  than five percent of all people lived in cities. By the middle of this century it could be seventy percent, or almost six and a half billion people. Already three-fourths of people in   _   countries live in cities. Now most urban population  _   is in the developing world.\n  Urbanization can  _  to social and economic progress, but also put   _  on cities\nto provide housing and  _  . The new report says almost two hundred thousand people move into cities\nand towns each day. It says worsening inequalities,  _  by social divisions and differences in  _  , could result in violence and crime unless cities plan better.\n  Another issue is urban sprawl  . This is where cities  _  quickly into rural areas, sometimes at a much faster rate than urban\npopulation growth.\n  Sprawl is   _  in\nthe United States. Americans move a lot. In a recent study, Art Hall at the\nUniversity of Kansas found that people are moving away from the  _  cities to smaller ones. He sees a  _  toward \"de-urbanization\" across the nation.\nBut urban economies still provide many  _  that rural areas do not.\n   www.k@s@5@u.com                            ####",
