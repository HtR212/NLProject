    "article": "For many people today, reading is no longer relaxation. To keep up their work they must read letters, reports, trade publications, not to mention newspapers and magazines: a never-ending flood of words. In  _  a job, the ability to read and understand  _  can mean the difference between success and failure. Yet the unfortunate fact is that most of us are  _  readers. Most of us  _  bad reading habits at an early age, and never get over them. The main reason  _  in the fact that words have little meaning  _  they are put together into phrases, sentences and paragraphs.  _  , however, the untrained reader does not read groups of words. He reads one word at a time and often goes back to  _  words or passages. The tendency to look back over  _  you have just read is a common bad habit in reading. Another habit which  _  down the speed of reading is sounding each word as  one  reads. To overcome these bad habits, some reading clinics use a machine called an accelerator , which moves a bar  _  the page at a predetermined speed. The bar is set at a slightly faster rate  _  the reader finds comfortable, in order to train him. The accelerator forces the reader to read fast,  _  word-by-word reading impossible. At first it is difficult to understand. But  _  you have learned to read ideas and concepts, you will not only read faster,  _  your comprehension will improve. Many people have found their reading skill quickly  _  after some training.  _  Charlce Au, a business manager, for example, his reading rate was 172 words a minute  _  the training and now it is an excellent 1,378 words a minute. He is happy that now he can  get through  a lot more reading materials in a short period of time.",
