I watched the man  _  off the blocks and knew immediately that something was wrong. Now I'm not an expert  _  but I do know a good dive  _  a poor one, and this was not exactly medal  _  . I listened to the crowd begin to  laugh at  this poor man that was clearly having a  _  time. Finally he made his turn to start back. It was  _  he made a few desperate stroke and you could tell he was exhausted. But in those few  _  strokes, the crowd had changed.

Even though he recorded one of the  _  times in Olympic history, this man gave more heart than any of the other  _  .
