Once, before a major  _  in front of a standing-room-only audience, a member off Arturo\nToscanini's orchestra approached the great Italian conductor with a terrible  _  on\nhis face.\"Maestro ,\"the musician said  _  ,\"my instrument is not working  _  . I cannot reach the  _  of E-flat. Whatever\nwill I do? We are to  _  a few moments later.\"\nToscanini looked with total  _  at the man. Then he  _  kindly and placed an arm\naround his shoulders.\"My friend,\"the maestro replied,\"do not worry about it.\nThe note E-flat does not  _  anywhere in the music that you\nwill be  _  this evening.\"\nThe next time we find ourselves in the middle of  _  about some matter, we might be wise to  _  and ask ourselves what the odds are of the problem really coming to  _  ,\nWe may be able to go on to something more constructive.",
