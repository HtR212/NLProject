    "article": "During our two months on the road, Bennett and I had a really  _  experience with a good, honest   _  and some helpful mechanics .\n              We were driving east on Highway 10 when our \"chick engine\" light came on. We limped of a (n)  _  into Las Cruces. We had a real car  _  .Bennett nursed the car into a local garage. By this time the car was missing so  _  it was shaking all over .This was the   _  time to arrive at a garage--late Friday afternoon. Service adviser Scott was busy  _  paper work and customers as we  _  our problems.   _  he was already \"ten cars behind\", he told us to pull the car into the garage.\n              Lincoln, who we later  _  was one of the too motor technicians, took  _  of our car repairing. He and Scott and some other mechanics stayed several hours after closing,   _   the car. \n              Early the next morning (the shop was officially closed on Saturdays), Lincoln finally located the  _   and fixed it easily within only  _  .\n              Later Scott  _  out to us that it was our attitude that helped . \"You didn't come into the place demanding this or that. You showed an   _  of our problems on a busy Friday afternoon. Customer's attitude means a lot.\" He was right in some way, customers should show  _  and understanding to people who  _  them.  Even if  people were extremely busy ,they found way to at least try and help when they are met with politeness.\n              The pleasant experience I had shows that  _  for other people can always help.",
