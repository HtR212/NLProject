    "article": "Mum adopted Monti from Melbourne's Lort Smith Animal Hospital in 2009. The   _   she shared with him was unbelievably strong. Monti took away a lot of   _   for Mum and really made her happy. He had been   _   by his former owner so he really took to our family. He was Mum's   _   friend and enjoyed her attention.\n              Not long after she adopted Monti, Mum came out of   _   after a near-death experience. I had put her to bed and went to bed myself, dead tired. Monti slept on Mum's bed, acting as a guard, and I had left the bedroom door slightly open   in case   she called out.\n              I was in a deep sleep when I awoke to Monti trying to lick my face. I was so   _   that I drove him away but he refused, which was really out of   _   for him. Suddenly, I heard the faintest of voices calling out for   _  . I jumped from my bed and rushed to the bathroom where I found my mother almost unconscious   and 45 _  in blood.\n              I called the ambulance and she arrived at the hospital without a pulse,   _   the medical team was able to bring Mum back to life and gradually she made a full   _  . We were blessed to have her in our lives for another three   _  . But for Monti's efforts that night, I know we would have   _   her.\n              After Mum passed away in 2012, Monti was extremely   _   and anxious. He couldn't find peace and constantly searched for her. Shortly after she   _  , he developed a facial palsy   that paralyzed half his face. I honestly believe it was due to his stress and the heartbreak of   _   my mum.\n              I love deserted dogs. They are certainly different from other dogs--not because they are \"damaged\", but because they are thankful. They   _   know they have been given another chance and they love you   _   it.\n              Monti has now become used to his new life with me. He is happy and   _   and has almost fully recovered from the palsy. My family will be forever grateful for his heroic deed that granted us that extra precious time with our mother.",
