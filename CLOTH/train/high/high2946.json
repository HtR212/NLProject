They all laughed. From that day on, I always  _  to be quiet in class.\nWhen I was thirteen years old, my family moved to a  _  city, so I went to a new school. On the first day, my dad and I  _  our house late. When I arrived at the school, the class had begun. I walked in and found the entire class was  looking at  me. This frightened me. For the next couple of classes I just sat  _  .\nMrs Smith, a kind-hearted teacher in my new class, noticed I was quiet. She decided to  _  me. The next day in her class, she handed out a piece of  _  to everyone. What I saw on the paper made my heart beat  _  ; it was an activity where you had to  _  people if they had or did any of those things listed on the paper. This meant that I had to talk to those strangers  _  I wanted to finish it. At first, I just stood there not  _  what to do, but then I thought, \"What if I actually tried to  _  to people? Then maybe I would make some  _  at this school.\" I encouraged myself and finally  _  talking with other students. Sure enough, those \"strangers\" turned out to be really  _  and helpful. They invited me to  _  with them after class. These people are  _  my friends today. We often hang out together.\nIf you're  _  just like I used to be, don't be afraid to talk to others. They can be very nice and may become your friends.",
