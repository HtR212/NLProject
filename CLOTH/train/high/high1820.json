    "article": "Recently, I flew to Las Vegas to attend a meeting. As we were about to arrive, the pilot announced with apology that there would be a slight   _   before setting down. High desert winds had   _   the airport to close all but one runway. He said that we would be   _   the city for a few minutes waiting to   _  . We were also told to remain in our seats meanwhile with our seat belts fastened   _   there might be a few bumps . Well, that few minutes turned into about forty-five minutes, including a ride that would make a roller coaster    _   by comparison. The movement was so fierce that several passengers felt   _   and had to use airsickness bags. As you might guess, that's not a good thing to have happen in a(n)   _   space because it only   _   to increase the discomfort of the situation.\nAbout twenty minutes into the adventure, the entire airplane became very   _  . There was now a sense of anxiety and fear that could be   _   noticed. Every passenger simply held on for dear life... except one. A   _   was having a good time! With each bump of the   _  , he would let out a giggle  of delight. As I observed this, I   _   that he didn't know he was supposed to be afraid and worried about his   _  . He neither thought about the past nor about the future. Those are what we grownups have learned from   _   . He was   _   the ride because he had not yet been taught to fear it. Having understood this, I took a deep breath and   _   back into my seat, pretending I was   _   on a roller coaster. I smiled for the rest of the flight. I even   _   to giggle once or twice, much to the chagrin  of the man sitting next to me holding the airsickness bag.",
