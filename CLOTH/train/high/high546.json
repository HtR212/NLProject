    "article": "I Was Forced to Find My Gifts\nI was a pretty typical 17-year-old with a strong interest in painting when something happened. One Sunday, I went to an old swimming hole and dove in. I   _   something under the water head-on and broke a couple of vertebrae of my neck.\nFor five months I stayed at the hospital, feeling like a   _   to my family. My self-image was instantly   _  . I was described with terms like \"disabled\" or \"crippled.\" I was angry and  _   after I failed so many times at some   _   task--dropping something on the floor and trying to get it back up again.\nNear the end of my stay in the hospital, my doctor almost forcibly tied a   _   to my hand. He had seen my paintings I'd done before and   _   me to paint. Fortunately, I found that I  _   had this artistic ability left. It was like a big weight had been   _  . At least I could do something worthwhile again, and it became a   _   part of my recovery.\nAfter I left the hospital, I stayed at home, feeling desperately   _  . It seemed like I was cut off from   _  . No one can get along   _   love and acceptance. So that fall, I started at the University of Texas, majoring in graphic design.\nOne day a man happened to see one of my paintings. He had a great   _   for it and asked if I ever did art shows. So I was given a(n)   _  . Much to my surprise, I found that people liked my paintings and would pay for them. That was about 11 years ago. Today, 1,500   _   have carried my work.\nIt was the art that provided the   _   for me to get up every morning and do something,   instead of   sitting in front of the television. Society has such   _   expectations of the disabled person, so it's very easy to get sucked into a dependency routine -- you know, the \"give me\" kind of attitude. And that's what I take the most   _   in -- the fact that what I'm doing today is well received all over.",
