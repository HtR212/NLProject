It seems just like  _  the lottery  , but better  _  you get both fame and money.\nFor me, the dream seemed likely to stay a dream. But everything  _  last week in Beijing.\nI was eating dinner with some friends. As I was getting ready to pay, a young Chinese woman came running up to me. I was  _  that I must have done something horrible to offend  her without  _  it.\n\"You are a white man,\" she said  _  when she got to our table.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Can you speak  _  ?\" she asked.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Oh good. Come with me now, please.\"\nI walked outside and saw that a movie was being shot in front of one of the street's largest  _  .\nThe woman, a talent agent, had  _  a foreigner for this movie, but he had forgotten to  show up  . She needed to find a white guy who spoke English, and I was the only one  _  . My part was to walk from one end of the street to the other, and then  _  the club. When I got to the club, I was supposed to  _  to my friend and say, \"Forget about the girl, man. We are here to party!\" It took me three tries to say the line  _  or walk without tripping, but  _  I got it right.\nThe talent scout ran to me afterward. \"You are so  _  . I would like you to join my agency.\" I know I am not going to be the next Jay Chou.  In fact  , it seems that my  _  \"star\" talents are being white and being able to speak English.  _  , next time you are watching a Chinese movie, look in the  _  . If you see a white guy stumbling   on his way into a nightclub, it might just be me in my way to stardom  .",
