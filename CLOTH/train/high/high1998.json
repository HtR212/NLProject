    "article": "My sons and I decided to go walking around the lake near our home the other day. It is such a  _  place to spend an afternoon in the springtime when flowers are  coming out  on the trees and grass is coming up through the ground. It has a well  _  path that circles the entire lake. You can walk at your own  _  and delight in all the natural beauty that surrounds you. It is the perfect place to get back to  _  nature and to fill your soul with joy.\nThe only  _  is that with the path being so near the water, erosion  sometimes creates holes. It was while we were  _  to walk along it the other day that one of them caught my oldest boy  _  . He stumbled and almost fell but thankfully was able to reach out and take my hand. I  _  him and we walked on for a while holding hands and feeling  _  in our love for each other.\nI think that sometimes the  _  we face in our long life are a lot like those holes in the ground. They are always there causing us to stumble and sometimes even to fall. It is good to know,  _  that we can always reach out and take the hands of our beloved ones. They are always there by our side  _  to pick us up and steady us. They are always  _  for us to take their hands and walk on with them connected in love without  _  .\nThe next time you stumble and fall on your  _  through life then reach out and take loving hands. And  _  you take them never let them go again. Walk on with them forever, choosing love and sharing joy with each  _  you take. Always remember too that with the loving hands  _  your walk you can use your other hands to reach out and help those who have fallen as well. The life journey,  after all  , is always better when you are holding the hands of those you love.",
