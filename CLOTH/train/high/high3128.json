As they were walking, they saw lying in the path a pair of old shoes, which they   _   belonged to a poor man who was working in a field close by.\nThe student turned to the professor, saying, \"Let's play a   _   on him: we'll hide his shoes, and hide ourselves behind those bushes, and wait to see his   _   when he cannot find them.\"\nThe professor said, \"We should   _   amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor. You are   _  , and may give yourself a much greater pleasure   by means of   helping the poor man. Let's put a coin into each shoe, and then we will   _   ourselves and watch how the\n  _   affects him.\" The student did so. Before long, the poor man came across the\n  _   to the path where he had left his coat and shoes.\nWhile putting on his coat he   _   his foot into one of his shoes, feeling something\n  _  . He bent down to see what it was, and found the coin.   _   and wonder appeared on his face. He stared at the coin, turning it around, then looked around on all sides without\n  _   anyone. He put the money into his pocket, and   _   to put on the other shoe, and his surprise was   _   upon finding the other coin.\nHe fell upon his   _  , looked up to heaven, and let out a sincere thanksgiving in which he spoke of his wife, sick and   _  , and his children who   _   bread, whom this timely help would save from dying.\nThe student stood there deeply affected, his eyes filled with tears. \"Are you not much better\n  _   than if you had played a trick?\" said the professor.",
