    "article": "The position of children in American family and society is no longer what it is used to be. The  _  family in colonial North America was mainly concerned with survival and  _  that, its own economic prosperity, Thus, children were  _  in terms of their productivity, and they played the role of producer quite early, Until they fulfilled this role, their position in the family was one of the subordination . With the  _  of the society, the position of the children in the family and in the society became more important. In the complex and technological society that the United States has become, each member must fulfill a number of personal and occupational roles and be in contact with many other members.  _  , viewing children as necessary members of society means that they are  _  more as people in their own right than as those of the family is reflected in various laws  _  the rights of children and in the social and public welfare programs. This new  _  of children and the frequent contact between the members of society has also  resulted in  an increasing interest in child-raising techniques. People today spend much time seeking the proper way to  _  children. Nowadays, the socialization of the child in the United States is a two-way transaction between parents and child  rather than  a one-way, parent-to-child training program. As a consequence, socializing child and  _  with them over a long period of time is for parents a mixture of pleasure, satisfaction, and problems",
