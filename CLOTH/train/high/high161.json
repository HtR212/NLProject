    "article": "At the age of seven, I went to see my grandma in Warwick and spent the summer with her. One day I went to a general store with a  _  full of what Grandma needed. \"Excuse me, I need to  _  these,\" I said . \"So ? I'm not your  _  ! You should get yourself a basket and start filling,\" Miss Bee, the owner of the store, said  _  without smiling. \"If you're  _  you'll be home by sunset.\" Sunset was five hours away.  _  , the store was a puzzle, and I wasn't sure if I would make it. I visited Miss Bee several times a week that  _  . One afternoon when I watched her adding 35 cents instead of 29 for a can of beans, I  _  her immediately. Though being caught overcharging , she didn't seem  _  , and she just fixed the price. All summer long I was always tricked by Miss Bee. No sooner had I memorized the soda's location on the shelf than she rearranged the shelves and made me  hunt for  it all over again. But by summer's end the  _  trip that had once taken me an hour was done in 15 minutes. The morning I was to return to Brooklyn, I stepped in to get a bottle of water. \"What did you  _  this summer?\" she said. \"That you're so mean!\" I whispered. To my  _  , Miss Bee laughed. \"When you get older, you'll be glad our paths crossed!\" Glad I met Miss Bee ? No! Until one day my daughter came to me with homework  _  . \"It's too hard,\" she said. \"Could you finish it for me?\" \"If I do it for you, how will you ever learn to do it yourself?\" Suddenly, I was  _  at that general store where Miss Bee had really taught me something all those years ago.",
