She has  _  put it on. And she was  _   it for a special occasion \", he told me.\nHe got near the bed and placed the gift box next to the other  _   he was taking to the funeral home ; his wife had just died. Then he turned to me and   _  :\n\"Never save something for a special occasion. Every day in your life is a  _  occasion\".\nI still think those words   _  my life.\nNow I spend more time with my  _  , and less at work. I\"ll wear  _  clothes to go to the supermarket, if I feel like my new clothes. I don't save my special perfume for special occasions; I use it   _  I want to. The words \"Some day ...\" and \"One day ...\"  _  gradually from my dictionary. If it's worth seeing, listening or doing , I want to see, listen or do it now.\nI don't know what my friend's wife would have  _  if she knew she wouldn't be there the next morning, and this  _  can tell. I think she might  _  her relatives and closest friends. She might call old friends to make peace over past  _  . She might go out for a Chinese, maybe her  _  food. It's these small things that I would regret  not doing, if I knew my  _  had come. I would regret it because I would no longer see the relatives and the friends, even the delicious food.\nNow, I try not to  _  anything that could bring laughter and joy into my life. And on each morning, I say to myself that this could be a special day. Each day, each hour, each minute, is special.",
