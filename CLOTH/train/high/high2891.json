    "article": "Leaving for work one morning, I noticed that my newspaper hadn't been delivered yet.Since I always took it to work, it  _  me that I would have to stop at the store and pick one up.I was already running late, but figured I could make it if I hurried. It was putting me in a  _  . mood.\nAs I pulled into the parking lot of the  _  to get a newspaper, I noticed a young man in a wheelchair who seemed to be  _  with his wheelchair.\"I'm sure he's all right\", I thought, \"or if he's not, someone else will help him.\"\n  _  by the customers and cars that were passing him by, I guessed they were thinking the  _  thing.I got out and walked over to see what the  _  was.\n\"Is there anything I can do?\" I asked. I noticed he wasn't able to  _  , and was still struggling with the wheelchair.\nI  look down  at the wheelchair and noticed that the clamp  holding the electronic keyboard and chair controls had  _  loosened, causing the equipment to slip down, out of his reach.\nI pulled it back into  _  .His hand pulled over to the keyboard and he hit a single key.An electronic voice said, \"Thank you.\"\nI  felt  a  wave of gratitude come over me. I  was  truly blessed to have the physical  _  that allowed me to live a normal life.The young man helped me gain a new way of thinking in life.",
