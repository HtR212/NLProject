    "article": "Just as the stock market rises and falls in response to what people are willing to put their money behind, we have inside ourselves an inner economy that rises and falls in response to our beliefs about what is possible. Sometimes the degree to which we are willing to  _  our belief systems determines the success of our inner economy. For example, imagine that your family of origin had a belief that musical talent was not something they  _  . As a member of that group, you would likely  _  that same belief about yourself. As a result, even if you had a great desire to create music, you might be  _  to really get behind yourself. Because you might fear that your  _  would not pay off. Even if you had the courage to follow your passion, your inner belief that you are not born  _  would probably stop your trying. And that would be a major  _  to invest your energy in your dream.\nOn the other hand, belief isn't anything  _  . If you found a way to  _  that negative belief, a great flood of energy would pour forth, greatly increasing the possibility of your success. How much energy we are willing to invest in the various ideas and dreams is like the money people are, or are not, willing to invest in the various products available for trade on the stock market. And in both cases,  _  plays a key role in determining how willing we are to get behind something. One way to open up the possibility for greater success in our inner economies is to understand that belief is not the reliable  _  we sometimes think. There are other more reliable things of success that we can put our  _  in, such as passion, feeling, and sense. Some of the most successful investors in the stock market are the ones that go against the grain, trusting their sense over the  _  opinion held by ordinary people about what will work.\nIn the same way, we can learn to trust our heart's desires and our sense to guide us,\n  _  any beliefs that stand in the way of our ability to fully invest in ourselves. As we take out energy from limiting ideas about what is possible, we  free up  the resources that have the power to make our inner economy prosper.",
