Then I  _  the bird\nbefore I saw it.\n\"What's that?\"I asked when I first heard the sound.\n\"It's coming from the  _  .\"my wife, Anita, said. \"Maybe it's one of the little  _  .\"\nI looked into the garage. No children at all. But there was that sound again, coming from right up there. And that's  _  I saw the sparrow. It was flying  _  just\ninches below the ceiling. It was clearly  _  to get out, but\ncouldn't see the way out was not up, but  _  and and out\nthrough the garage door. So the bird continued flapping its wings and bumping\nits little head  _  the ceiling.\nI tried to terrify it out, but only succeeded in driving it into the   _  open space between the\ndoor and the ceiling. Then I tried to show the bird how to fly down a few feet  so that  it could get outside, but that only seemed to  _  it more.\n\"Why don't we just leave for a few minutes,\" Anita  _  .\"I'm sure he'll figure it out eventually.\"\nWe went back into the house, where we  _  to hear the ongoing struggle between the sparrow and the ceiling.\nThen suddenly, it was  _  and our uninvited guest was gone.\nI've  thought about  that little\nsparrow through the years, and I've decided that birds are not different much\nfrom people. We think we were  _  to fly ever upward, and we\ndon't even consider the  _  that something good might happen\nif we just fly down a little bit. Once we figure out that we can make  _  without banging our heads against ceilings, we can usually save ourselves much   _  .",
