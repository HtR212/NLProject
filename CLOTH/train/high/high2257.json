    "article": "Last summer, I cycled to a small village with my friend Mike. We had a   _   time there. However, when we were   _   a bike on a narrow road, we found a big tree lying across the road.\nWe had to   get off   the bike. And Mike  _  complaining, \"Why did someone put a tree across the road? And why did   _   get it out of the road?\" He  _  complaining. I thought he would ask me to help him get the tree out of the road, but he didn't.   _   , he just stepped over it with his   _   , followed by me. And he still didn't stop complaining, \"I guess nowadays no one is   _   to do something for others.\" I thought now he would   _   to remove it, but he still didn't. He just got on his bike and was about to leave. But I didn't follow him. Noticing I wasn't   _  , he asked me, \"What's wrong?\" I said, \"Let's remove the   _  .\" He looked puzzled and asked, \"  _  should we do it? It's not our responsibility.\" But I insisted.   At last  , he got off his bike and we got the tree out of the road together. \"You see, there are still   _   who are willing to do something for others,\" after removing the tree, I said laughingly to my friend and he   _  , too.\nMy dear friends, when something is in your   _   next time, you can choose to complain and just   _   it there. But you can   _   choose to get it out of the way. Don't   _   for others to do that. You can be the one who does something for others.",
