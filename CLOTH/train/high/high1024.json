While express mail represents efficiency and speed and is popular in China, there is another type of mail emerging as a new business-- \"  _  mail\".\n\"The letter should be delivered next Mother's Day and not a day earlier!\" Lin Xiaofan, a senior high school student in Hefei, instructs one of the companies   _  the service.\nLin Xiaofan wrote the letter to her mother  in advance  to express her love to her mother for next Mother's Day.\n\"Offering this service makes people   slow down  and let them understand the meaning of  _  in\nanother way,\" said Zheng Zhimin, manager at a \"future mail\"\ncompany in Hefei. Zheng thinks \"future mail\" letters are\n\"reminders of affection,  _  , and love.\"\nFeng Xiao, a youth who feels pressure   despite  some achievement in her career, decided to write a letter to  _  on her 25th birthday and have it delivered five years later on her  _  birthday through a \"future mail\".\n\"I expressed my thoughts about my   _  life and my expectations for the future to encourage myself to  _  up to the challenges of my life with courage,\" Feng said.\nWhile \"future mail\" is gaining popularity, some are concerned about what happens if the postal   _  of\nthe receiver changes or if the company  goes broke  before\nletters are delivered.\nZheng said customers are required to   _  an acceptance form and make an\nassessment so they can be compensated if their letters or goods are lost or damaged.\n\"I won't be too disappointed   even if  I\ncannot receive my letters, because for me what is more important are the  _  when I write the letter,\" said Zhu Min, who works for a foreign\ncompany in Shanghai.\nMost of the business'  _  are\ncollege students and young white-collar workers. Most people  _  their\nhopes and wishes in the letter so they can  _  the\nconnection between the past and the present  _  they\nreceive the letter. It can help people understand the meaning of \"time\".",
