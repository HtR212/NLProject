    "article": "Cancer Cancelled\nMy name's James and I am an 18-year \"Cancer Survivor\". When I was 15 years of age, I was at my house one day with my two sisters and when I tried to run up the steps, I blacked out, and   _   the stairs very hard. When I came to myself, I remembered my sisters saying \"Are you alright?\" and I replied \"I think so, yeah.\" But little did my sisters and I know that was the beginning of this   _  . When I began to try to climb the stairs, my whole right leg hurt seriously. I couldn't move it   _   the assistance of my hands. The   _   was horrible. I finally made my way upstairs and I couldn't   _   I couldn't move my leg. As time went on it got   _   so a month later I finally went to hospital. I explained to the doctor what had happened. Then I was asked to go to the rooms   _   they treated me to the X-rays, MRI, and CAT SCANS machines. One week later, my doctor   _   the house and said, \"You need to come up here right away!\"\nMy mother and I   _   up there and they had the X-rays results ready for me-My body seemed   _    except my right leg. I was surrounded by doctors and nurses.\nI got my   _  , but wasn't clear on what was happening. They   _   us back home. Three days later, they   _   an expert from another continent or someplace and he looked at my X-rays one time and said \"OH MY GOD, this young man has bone cancer.\"\nOnce all of that got cleared up, they   _   my chemotherapy  treatments a week later. On October 9, 2014, I had the surgery, the bone replacement surgery. I was told that I couldn't   _   like a normal person anymore, so   _   was impossible. I couldn't do this or that, etc. Basically my   _   was over before it even got started. When I got through with my final chemotherapy I was   _   40 kg.\nI want to share this story with you guys because today I'm 84 kg with 2% body fat. I don't smoke or drink. I can walk and even run. I'm so   _   to be here and forever to grace life with my presence each day. My dream is to become the \"60 _ \" to everybody who ever thought about giving up on life because it's so hard, or just simply not living it.",
