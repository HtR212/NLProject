Someone to love, something to do and something to hope for.\nWhen I was three years old, I slept on a very  _  bed in a large room with twenty-five other boys and girls In  _  orphanage   in Hungary, Kristin, my  _  , and I had been taken from our birth mother to the orphanage when we were only babies because she couldn't take care of us. We had lived in the orphanage for about six months by the time Christmas came. None of us got any presents  at all  . We got two meals a day but the bread was hard and the food was  _  . I had one good friend at the orphanage named Attila, and we  used to  talk a lot about what it would be like to have somebody come and take us away from there. Our dream was to have a  _  family and do things that most other children did.\nTwo or three times, people came to the orphanage and talked to my sister Kristin and me, but they  _  came back to see us again.\nOne day, a pretty lady with long hair and a big man with glasses came to see Kristin and me. We  _  understand what they were saying, but the Hungarian girl,  _  was with them, told us that they had come from a faraway place called America,and that they wanted to adopt us and  _  us back with them to America. We were so excited and  _  . When I told Attila what was going to happen, he was very  _  and didn't want us to leave him there. I told him he should ask the big man if he would take him  so that  he could come to America and be my brother. The  _  time the man and the lady came, he jumped up into the man's lap and asked him if he could come with us. But, since the man didn't speak  _  he didn't know what Attila wanted and just  _  at him.\nKristin and I  _  on a great big jet to America. Things  _  very different but wonderful here. Everyone here is very nice and the food tastes great, and I have my own room with a big bed and lots of clothes. America is a great place and I am very happy here.\nAfter a year, we went with a group of children to a special ceremony where we were made  _  of the United States!",
