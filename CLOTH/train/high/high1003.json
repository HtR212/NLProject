    "article": "I truly hope that at the end of this short essay  you will know how to learn English.\nI was born in Somalia, and Italian is my mother tongue.  _  enough, soon after I arrived in London when I was 17, I was admitted to a sixth-form college. I found caring   teachers there, who  _  taught me English. This, I think, was a(n)  _  factor  that encouraged me to learn the language. The most important thing,  however  , is to work hard. So those of you who don't have such good teachers should not  lose heart  . When I was in London, I  _  myself to English learning as I  _  to go to university very much. Mastering the language was the only  _  to achieve my goal.\nNow I have  _  my master's degree from Oxford University. Looking back, I  _  I was quite innocent  ,for I never imagined learning English was going to be so much  _  . The more fluent I become, the  _  the language became. One can master it only  _  years of tireless efforts .\nSome basic  _  which I would give to people who are interested in learning the language are:\n1. Buy a good dictionary.  _  English learners use their dictionaries all the time.\n2.  _  English newspapers. Don't forget to  _  the new words in your dictionary.\n3. Listen to the radio  instead of  watching TV as listening to the radio helps you more.\n4. Talk, talk and talk to  _  at anytime and anywhere.\nAnd even though at times it may be embarrassing  to make  _  ,you will finally correct them and remember them. Soon you will start to become fluent.",
