Before I wanted to buy what I wanted, I had a(n)  _  to make, and I was stopped by the woman, who wanted to  _  my bag. Usually I would have got angry, because I knew I didn't steal. I had just noticed someone ahead of me being not so nice. That person treated this lady as if she was  _  . The person had just snatched a bag back from her and stormed off  _  even saying \"thank you\". I could say that this lady looked  _  , but she was still trying to make ends meet. I could tell this woman was  _  by what had just happened, and no one knew how many people had been  _  her that way all day long. What if she was a grandmother who had to  care for  her grandchildren, because the parents had just lost their life in an accident? What if her husband was seriously  _  and they couldn't afford the medical expenses? All she wanted was to do her  _  well. All she wanted was to  _  customers as she was trained. All she needed was to be  _  . I wondered whether I could be someone that she needed. I looked her in her eyes as she scanned my bag, and then I smiled and said, \"Your hair is beautiful!\" Her face  lit up  and she told me how easy it was to manage her hair. She handed my bag back, and told me the customer service desk was straight down on my left. I said \"Thank you!\"",
