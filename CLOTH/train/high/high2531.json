    "article": "Not being sure where I want to start this, I will say that I lost my mom back in April of this year. She was ninety-two.   _  , I was not expecting her to   pass away   and I don't think she was expecting it either. I was very close to my mom, being an only child. We did have   _   on the surface, but we still had a close relationship   in spite of   those.\nBeing newly married less than a year, and having moved a couple of times   _  , I have had more changes recently in my life than at any other point of my fifty-four years. Stability is one of the gifts that Mom   _   me and it had so many   _   that I wasn't aware of until now. My husband and I have made some   _   to Mom's home and will be moving at the end of next week. It is now our home, but it still has my   _   heart in it. It's where I grew up, and there are many   _   that will live there with us. At the same time, I am looking forward to   _   some very happy and memorable ones with my husband.\nMom   _   such a big part in my life. Our lives were   _   woven because she gave me her values which have become strongly   _   in the woman I am today. I don't have any children whom I could   _   these on to. However, Mother's values affect me every day with the   _   I have with others, whether I know them or not. I hope Mom would be   _   of who I am, what I've become because of her, and of   _   I am going to live with my   _  . She gave me everything I needed to know in life: respect others, and give help to others who   _   it most. I love you, Mom, and I will never forget you.",
