Take, for example, the story of one 10-year-old boy who decided to study judo    in spite of   the fact that he had lost his left arm in a car accident.\nThe boy began lessons with an old Japanese judo master. The boy was doing well,   _   he wondered why, after three months of   _  , the master had taught him only one move.\n\"Sensei,\" the boy finally said, \"shouldn't I be learning more moves?\"\n\"This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,\" the sensei   _  .\nNot quite understanding, but   _  in his teacher, the boy kept training.\nSeveral months later, the sensei took the boy to his first   _  .\n  _   himself, the boy easily won his first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, his   _   became impatient and charged; the boy   _  used his one move to win the match.   _   amazed by his success, the boy was now in the finals.\nThis time, his rival   was bigger, stronger, and more  _  . For a while, the boy appeared to be overmatched. Concerned that the boy might get hurt, the   _   called a timeout. He was about to stop the match when the sensei intervened .\n\"No,\" the sensei   _  , \"let him continue.\"\nSoon after the match resumed, his rival made a big mistake: he dropped his  _  , at which the boy gave him a sudden turnover.

Then the boy   _   the courage to ask what was really on his mind.\n\"Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one  _  ?\n\"You won for two reasons,\" the sensei answered. \"First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. Second, the only known   _   for that move is for your rival to grab your   _   arm.\"\nThe boy's biggest weakness had become his biggest  _  .",
