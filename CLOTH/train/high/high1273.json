When we arrived. we learned that our bags had  _  not made the trip with our plane. As we were filling out the  _  luggage forms, we couldn't help noticing the mountain of unclaimed baggage in a corner. Would we  _  see our belongings again? This was not a good beginning of our 6-week trip. It was now 4 am Saturday morning. The officials had told us there was no  _  in checking to see if our bags had arrived until Monday. What should we do next?  _  we stood there wondering, Uma came over. Learning of our  _  , she said. \"Our driver will soon be here to  _  me up. Come home with me.\" We entered the steamy early  _  scene outside. Lots of people were waiting for their loved ones. calling their names and  _  them into warm hugs as they reconnected.  _  minutes, Uma said, \"There's our car!\" We piled into the small car, already  _  with family members who had come to  _  Uma home. At the house, Uma's family took us in  as if  we had known one another for a long time. They fed us delicious Indian meals, took us on  _  of their city and brought us to their favorite temples. On  _  morning. their driver brought us to the airport, where we were happy to find our bags,  _  and sound. What a gift Uma's  _  was! In my very first moments on Indian soil. I learned an unforgettable lesson about the warm, generous  _  of the Indian people. Uma had begun achain reaction that we did our best to  _  on wherever we went.",
