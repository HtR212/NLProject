    "article": "Members of the post-1990 generation looking for work apply for multiple positions.They hold High  _   of the jobs, a reflection of young people's changing attitudes in the country's development,a recent research showed.\nWhen fresh graduates do land a job interview, they are also more likely to miss it,  turn down  offers and have no qualms about quitting if the work is not  to their taste  \nThese were some of the main  _   of the research conducted by leading Chinese recruitment   website 5ljob.com.Of those  _  , 45.1% of the employers said more than half of job candidates   _   to turn up on time for interviews.More than 60% of the fresh  _   also felt they needed help from their parents to look for work, the research showed.\nLiu Jinjin, deputy director of the human resources department at the Social Sciences Academic Press, said members of the post-1990 generation are  _  about employment and it was   _   for them to break appointments for job interviews.\n\"Most of the post-1990 generation are the only child in the family.Their living conditions have greatly  _  from that of the post-1980 and post-1970 generations.They don't experience much  _  in life so they pay closer attention to personal   _  and interests when hunting for a job.The post-1990 generation also does not care about the amount of money they make.  _  the working environment, the happiness they get from their work and respect from others are what  _   most.\"Liu said.\n\"The post-1990 generation does not think twice about leaving in their first year of work.If they lose interest in a job or are not clear about their future career path, they will  _  easily,\" Liu said.Members of the generation are also more self-centered.They want more time for themselves and are not willing to work   _  . Their attitude to life is more casual, Liu said.Zhang Gao, the campus brand director of Chinese Internet search giant Baidu, said a survey it conducted this year found that the post-1990 generation focus on work-life  _  ,\"They need some space when they work and don't want to be managed too   _   .\"Zhang said.  _  that members of that generation often choose to work according to their interests and have their own ideas and views about work.\n\"  In short  this generation is very sensitive and has a lot of self-respect, so employers need to be concerned about their temperaments and ways of communication,\" she said.",
