    "article": "After thinking thoroughly about it, I found that life is worth everything. For me, life is not just about having good friends, money or a job that I like. Some people will be    _  with things\nlike these because  _  them, they're by far the\nbest they can get. For me, they're not all I can  _  from\nthis world.\nI believe in harps  and violins and    _  and lightning. I believe in being in love and not just trying\nmy best to make others  _  .I believe in \"  _  in love\" with my partner, not just \"loving\" him.\nLife is worth so much. Life is more than spending    _  hours in the gym and eating carrot just to  _  praise from  _  .The praise of others  indeed  makes me feel happy, but it is not the main  _  of my life. My life is not about living to fulfill someone else's  _  but my own.\nLife is more than    _  pursuing the\nnorms   of    _  but trying to be a good\nperson by my own  _  .It is not about  _  chasing dreams to be superior to others. It's more about long walks in the\nquiet green parks  _  in my own thoughts. It's\nmore about feeling the  _  in my face, as I go\nthrough the  _  on my bicycle.\nLife is about passion, freedom and love. I will only walk this road     _  ;I might as well make the most of it.",
