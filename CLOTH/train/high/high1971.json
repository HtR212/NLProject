In the past years, we have always held a Christmas gift exchange at our house with at least ten of our   _  . Each year, we all buy gifts   _   in Christmas paper. When everyone is sitting around a   _   at home, all the gifts are piled in the middle of the floor.\nPeople choose a(n)   _   from a bowl that tells him or her when they can take their   _   to choose their gifts. The person with the number one can choose any   _   and then, each person picks one in turns. Before they choose a gift, they have the   _   of taking the gift from the former person.   At the end   when all numbers have chosen a gift, the person   _   the first number can then take a gift away from any other person.\nWhat is always interesting is   _   each person as they choose a gift. What happens   _   usually happens more often than not. The biggest gift always gets chosen first. It is hardly the smallest gift,   _   is it the fanciest gift-wrapping. What does this tell us about most human   _  ?\nIs the   _   always the best or worth the most? Is it that we think that something small is not worth as much or cannot   live up to   our expectations?\nHuman beings, in fact, appear   _   all sorts of packaging and size. Some are bigger and some are smaller; some are dressed   _   and some are dressed poorly. Behind every human trapping though   _   unforeseen characteristics, talents, desires, hurts, pains and dreams.\nJust as Terry Josephson, a motivational speaker, says, \"  _   thinking in terms of limitations and start thinking in terms of possibilities.\"",
