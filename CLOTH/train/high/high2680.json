As I grew, this sightless eye in so many ways  _  me. I walked with my face looking at the  _  so that people would not see the  _  me. Yet my mother would say to me, at every turn, \"Hold your head up high and  face  the world. If you hold your head up high, it will be OK, and people will see your  _  soul.\" She continued this  _  whenever I was trying to hide. Mama's words were of great help for me to face the world  _  . As a teenager, even though I tended to look down to hide my shame, I found that sometimes when I held my head up high and let people know me, they  _  me.
