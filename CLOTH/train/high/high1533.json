Several decades ago he made a mistake -- a (n)  _  mistake, though.\nOn a cold Saturday, Grandpa was building some wooden cases for the clothes his  _  was sending to an orphanage   in Congo. On his way back home, he  _  into his shirt pocket for his glasses, but they were gone. So he drove back to the church. His search proved  _  . When he  _  replayed his earlier actions, he realized what happened. The glasses had slipped out of his pocket and  _  into one of the cases. His new glasses, having  _  him $20, were heading for Congo that morning! He had to drive home  _  .\nSeveral months later, the director of the orphanage came to give a report at my grandfather's church, which Grandpa also attended.\nThe director said, \"I must thank you for the  _  you sent last year. The bandits   had just swept through the orphanage,  _  everything, including my glasses.  Even though  I had the money, there was simply no way of  _  the broken pair of glasses.  Along with  not being able to see well, I experienced headaches every day. Then your cases  _  .

It was amazing!\"\nThe people listened,  _  for the miraculous glasses. But the director must have  _  their church with another, they thought.
