    "article": "Around twenty years ago I was living in York.  _  I had a lot of experience and a Master's degree, I could not find  _  work. I was  _  a school bus to make ends meet and  _  with a friend of mine, for I had lost my flat. I had  attended  five interviews with a company and one day between bus runs they called to say I did not  _  the job. \"Why has my life become so  _  ?\" I thought painfully. As I pulled the bus over to  drop off  a little girl, she handed me an earring  _  I should keep it  in case  somebody claimed it. The earring was painted black and said \"BE HAPPY\". At first I got angry. Then it  _  me -- I had been giving all of my  _  to what was going wrong with my  _  rather than what was right! I decided then and there to make a  _  of fifty things I was happy with. Later, I decided to  _  more things to the list. That night there was a phone call for  me  from a lady who was a director at a larger  _  . She asked me if I would  give  a one-day lecture on stress management to 200 medical workers. I said yes. My  _  there went very well, and before long I got a well-paid job. To this day I know that it was because I changed my way of  _  that I completely changed my life.",
