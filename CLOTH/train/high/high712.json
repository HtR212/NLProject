    "article": "I recently returned from a trip to Walt Disney World where my wife and I celebrated our 40thwedding anniversary. While traveling   _   at 35,000 feet I could not help but be grateful to the people who   _  to the incredible flying machine. Looking out of the   _   , I could see a wide expanse of both earth and sky where limits were not seen in direction or space.\nRivers, valleys, mountains, and colors entered my mind   _  I sat and gazed at a scene that most passengers missed as they either slept or   _  what was beside them. What if they   _   being unaware of the world around them?  What if they began to gather with focused intent to make a better world, to change the air, and to find   _   among nations? I saw out of my window nothing that   _  conflict or strife .   _   I saw was a world, a beautiful blue and white world, which surpassed the beauty of my wildest   _  .\nI   looked around   the plane and saw few people take the time to look and see that wonder. Some were reading worrisome news while   others  tended to their children. The stewardess  went about her duties in a(n)   _  kind of way. \"What would you like to drink?\" \"What kind of snack would you like?\" was her world.\nWhat if we   set aside   just one minute to focus on the   _  of this world and its people? What if we began to remove the walls that separate us   _  each other and the outside world?  What if peace was the focus of our   _  for just that small amount of time? Would our world change? I feel the   _  are found in the questions themselves. Why not begin to use focused intent to change, and   _  the world of our dreams? It will   _  only a few minutes each day. What a difference that would make!",
