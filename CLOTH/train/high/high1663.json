    "article": "This is a story about a student, who kept a diary filled with private memories. Some were   _  memories from childhood when he felt hurt, confused, lonely and insecure. He had    _   fragments  of dreams and personal   _   of anger and hatred, as well as things he   _  such as magic shops, coin dealers and Christmas reunion.\nThen a    _  thing happened. After dinner one night he realized that he had    _   his diary in the dining hall outside the campus. He was afraid that someone might    _   it and find out the truth about him, so he    _    back from the campus, only to find that it was gone.\nWeeks passed, and eventually he gave up the    _   of ever finding it again. A month later, he was hanging up his jacket in the same place   _    he saw his old brown diary, just where he had left it.    _  he flickered   through the pages and found that a stranger had written this entry: \"God bless you. I am a lot like you, only I don't keep a diary. I am    _   to know there are others like me. I hope things    work out   well for you.\nTears came to his eyes. He had never    _   that someone could know his inner feelings and also feel things just like the    _   he did.\nSo whether you are rich or poor, brilliant or    _   , attractive or plain, there are people like you. One of the most deadly    _    we have is that we are not satisfying others. Perhaps you feel you won't impress others     _    they are more confident, successful, intelligent or attractive than you. Such   _  is misguided. Get rid of your fears of not measuring up, and    _   yourself as you are.",
