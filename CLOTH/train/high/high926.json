    "article": "Two men, both seriously ill, were in the same hospital room. One man was allowed to  sit up  in his bed for an hour each afternoon for treatment. His  _  was next to the room's only window. The other man  had to  spend all his time flat on his back. Every  _  when the man in the bed by the window could sit up, he  _  pass the time by describing to his  _  all the things he could see outside the window. The window overlooked a  _  with a lovely lake. Ducks played on the water while children  _  their model boats. Young lovers walked  arm in arm  among flowers. As the man by the window described all this beautifully, the other man would close his eyes and  _  the scene. One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the  _  body of the man by the window, who had died  _  in his sleep. She was sad and  _  the hospital attendants to take the body away.  As soon as  it seemed appropriate , the other man asked if he could  be moved  next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch , and after  making sure  he was comfortable, she left him alone. Slowly and painfully, he sat up to take his  _  look at the world outside. Finally, he would have the  _  of seeing it for himself. He strained to slowly turn to  look out  the window beside the bed. It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse what could have forced his dead roommate to  _  those wonderful things outside this window. The nurse answered that the man was blind and could not even see the wall. She said, \"Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you.\"",
