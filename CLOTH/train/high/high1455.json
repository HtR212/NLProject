He or she works close to the canvas  ------  _  small sections at a time in the process of completing the whole painting.\nBut every once in a while, the  _  must step back from their work and look at the whole picture. Only by stepping away from what they're working on can they  _  the proper perspective . The proper point of view is  _  to the end result.\nThere is no difference for any other creation.  _  it's a business, a project or your life, you need to step back  _  in order to get it right. From a  _  , you can see things you can't see when you're close. The difference is in working on your project  instead of  working in it.  It's all too easy to focus on something but  _  the important parts needed to create a satisfying result.\nStephen Covey calls it \"  _  the saw \". It would be  _  to keep sawing away without stopping from time to time to make your  _  sharper. But unfortunately, that's what too many of us  _  .\nJust as in music --- we need spaces  _  the notes  in order to create the lovely melody .  A continuous collection of notes with no spaces is not good --- it's  _  .\nYou may need to take a vacation --- to  get away from  work or study. At other times, it's best to take a course or attend a meeting to  _  some new complete break, to go away and just do something totally  _  --- do a voluntary work, build a house for Habitat for Humanity or some other worthy cause.\nThe important thing is to take the breaks. Without them, we are not  _  and we don't enjoy our work or our life as much. Our pressure  _  and both our work and our health suffer.",
