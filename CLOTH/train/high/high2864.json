    "article": "Many people complain that their memory is bad, particularly as they get older. Life would be so much easier if we could remember things   _  . So how can we improve our memory?\nMany people think that repeating things is the best way to remember. While this undoubtedly helps short-term memory (remembering a telephone number for a few seconds,   for example  ), psychologists doubt whether it can help you to remember things for long. The British psychologist E.C. Stanford seemed to   _   this point when he tested himself on five prayers that he had read aloud every morning for over 25 years. He found that he could remember no more than three words of them!   More helpful  , especially for remembering numbers, is 'chunking'  , or grouping the information. The following numbers would be   _   for most of us to remember. 1492178919931848. But look at them in 'chunks', and it becomes much easier. 1492 1789 1993 1848. \nSo what about 'memory training'? We've all   heard about   people who can memorise packs of card by heart --- how is this done and can anyone learn how to do it?   According to   experts, there are various ways of training your memory. Many of them   _   forming a mental picture of the items to be memorised. One method, which may be useful in learning foreign languages, is to create a picture in your mind   associated with   a word you want to remember. Another method is to invent a story that includes all the things you want to remember. People were asked to remember up to 120 words using this technique; when tested afterwards, on average, they were able to   _   90 per cent of them! Surprisingly, however, there is nothing   _   about these methods --- they were around even in ancient times. Apparently the Roman general Publius Scipio could   _   his entire army --- 35,000 men in total! \n  _  , not all of us are interested in learning long lists of names and numbers just for fun. For those studying large quantities of information, psychologists suggest that the best way to 'form   _   connections' is to ask yourself lots of questions as you go along. So, for example, if you were reading about a particular disease, you would ask yourself questions like: 'Do people get it from water?', 'What parts of the body does it affect?' and so on. This is said to be far more effective than time spent '  _  ' reading and re-reading notes.",
