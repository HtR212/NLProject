Every shelf and  _  was loaded with different crafters' handiwork. As I walked through the store, I noticed a wooden plaque hanging on a wall. I turned to take  a second  look and remember shaking my head \"yes\" at  the message  printed on the plaque. \"Life isn't about waiting for the  _  to pass,\" the plaque proclaimed . \"It's about learning to dance in the rain.\" As I pulled my husband over and directed his attention to the plaque, I could see that he too  _  the simple lesson the plaque shared.
