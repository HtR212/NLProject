Across the street from the campus was a   _  full of well-dressed, middle-class people.\nOne day, Bill decided to worship there. He walked into the church, with his wild hair, T-shirt, blue jeans and   _   feet. The church was completely   _  , and the   _   had already begun. Bill started down the aisle to find a place to sit. By now the people were looking a bit   _  ,but no one said anything.\nAs Bill   _   closer and closer to the pulpit  , he realized there were no   _   seats. So he sat down on the carpet right up   _  . By now, the tension in the air was   _  .\nRight about the time Bill took his \"seat\", an elderly man began slowly making his way   _  the aisle. He was in his eighties with silver gray hair. He was a godly man--elegant and dignified. He walked with a stick and, as he neared the boy, church members thought, \"How can you expect a man of his age and background to   _   some college kid on the floor?\"\nIt took a   _   time for the man to reach the boy. The church was   _   except for the clicking of his   _  . All eyes were on the   elderly man  .\n  _   then they saw the elderly man   _   his stick on the floor. With great difficulty, he sat down on the floor next to Bill and worshipped with him. Everyone in the church   _   up with emotion. When the minister gained control, he told the people, \"What I am about to preach  , you will never remember. What you've just seen, you will never 60 _ \".",
