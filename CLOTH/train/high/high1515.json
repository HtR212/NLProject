    "article": "One afternoon,the high school boy Clay Jensen received a mysterious package with no return address. When he opened it,he was  _  to find seven tapes,which were  _  by Hannah Baker,his classmate who had committed suicide  two weeks earlier. Clay had secretly been in love with her but never had the  _  to tell her about it.\nOn the tapes,Hannah had  _  thirteen reasons for ending her own  _  and Clay was one of the reasons. Hannah had even left him a  _  marking places with dots for him to visit. Clay walked out of his home and with her voice in his  _  ;he wandered all over the town trying to uncover the reasons why she felt her life had to end so tragically .\n  _  Hannah and Clay's story,American author Jay Asher wove a sad story of confusion and desperation in novel,Thirteen Reasons Why,which had  _  on The New York Times best-selling list for eight weeks.\nWhen Clay anxiously  found out  how he played a part in her suicide, he noticed how a number of little, seemingly unimportant  _  can add up to a terrible high school existence for someone else.It  _  us all that sometimes when something is said or done to  _  another, it can have  _  effects and can even lead to other major events in that person's life.\nThe theme of the story is that we are all  responsible for  our own actions. Hannah admitted it was her  _  to end her life. However, if someone had  _  differently,she could have changed her decision.\n  Even though  it is an imaginary story, many of us will connect parts of Hannah's high school career with something in our life and may  _  know someone showing warning signs of suicide. And  _  we can act and prevent such a tragedy.",
