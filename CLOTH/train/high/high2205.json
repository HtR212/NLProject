    "article": "Since I moved to Seattle, there's no farm whose name has come up more than Quillisascut. Quillisascut is a cheese company,  _  what they call \"traditional farmstead cheese'', but it's also a school.  _  completing a five-day \"Introduction to Farming\" workshop at Quillisascut, I understand why this farm school is so  _  . I hope that you can one day visit it, too. At Quillisascut, mornings begin at 5:30 am with  _  and milking the goats. The morning's  _  is made into cheese in the afternoon. Cheese making requires many steps. The process can take one day to several months,  depending on  the type of cheese being made. During our workshop, we were lucky enough to have the farm's chefs  _  meals of grains and beans from neighboring farms and herbs from the garden. All of the foods used for cooking are either grown there or  _  sourced. Any  _  from meals is made into compost . It is  _  onto the farm's land, transforming Quillisascut's soil  _  fertile salad bars for the goats. In addition to sunlight, rain, and compost, the goat farm  _  seeding and reseeding. When I know where my food came from, who  _  it, and the complex process it took to get to my  _  , food does more than fuel my body. It also heats my  _  . I wonder how different our food and healthcare systems would look like if all people learnt firsthand about the  _  and tears involved in bringing food to the table. If every food production operation  _  the public onto its ground, it is possible that our country's food system would look very different; and our country's connection with food could  _  . But for now, Quillisascut and other educational farms are making a(an)  _  , carrying out the goal \"to make the world a more  _  place\".",
