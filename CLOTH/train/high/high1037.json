    "article": "My grandparents lived in a town in Michigan .Every summer I stayed with them as a young child .I came from the city but loved the small   _   they lived in. People knew everyone else,their kids,their pets and their ancestors. The bond with them   _   to grow as I grew older.\nMy grandma was   _   at making something exciting by hand. She would make little sandwiches and we'd have tea parties. She'd   _   flowers and carefully tend them. She'd    _   sweaters for her grandchildren as well as making beautiful   _   for each one. I remember the small thimble  she would use while doing her needlework. .  _   her thimble on her finger,she'd remark: \"I wouldn't want to sew without one.\"\nA few years ago my grandma   passed away   at the age of 91.After attending her funeral,I realized how   _   our lives had changed. I missed her very much. When my birthday came,I was feeling   _   because there was no card from my grandma .But what happened later made me feel that she was   _   that special day with me. While I was arranging some   _   pillows that my grandma had made,I   _   felt something inside one pillow .It was small and   _  .I moved the object to a seam  and I carefully opened it. To my   _  ,out came a tiny silver thimble!\nHow  _   I was to find something that had been a part of her. Not realizing it had fallen off her finger,my grandma   _   it in that little pillow for me. I carefully laid the thimble along with the other things I had   _   over the years,which reminded me of the pleasant   _   of her.\nI heated the tea kettle and made some   _  ,using my best china,as my grandma always did,and enjoyed my tea and my grandma's thimble. What a wonderful birthday that was!",
