The young apprentice glanced at the opening and said, \"  _  I can do except replace the upper.\" His master looked at them and said to me, \"If you  _  me, I will add more scratches on both of the shoes.\" I was  _  and asked why. He explained, \"As if the openings were made  on purpose  for the sake of special style and reuse.\" Two days later I found there were indeed more scratches on  _  shoe, but all the openings were patched by soft red leather with edges sewed by thick thread,  _  more unique and interesting than ever.I couldn't help but  _  the master's skill. Another time, my wife's sister's white blouse had been torn, leaving a large opening on the back.My wife  _  the blouse carefully, and then said, \"Let me take it  _  and mend it.\" Seeing the blouse again, I was shocked: all the torn parts had been sewed up by thin and  _  thread and they  took on  hanging from a winter's branch.  _  , she had attached a snowman and a cabin made of flowery cotton rags onto the shirt.I  _  with praise, \"It's just as beautiful as a piece of  _  !\" \"I was inspired by that craftsman.Patches are supposed to be  _  , but a skillful craftsman can make it take on a kind of perfection,\" replied my wife. Her words inspired me even more: Perfection is  _  to achieve in everything; Patches are unavoidable, so is human's life.Since you can't  _  the existence of wound, you should not expect people's  _  by exposing the wound, which reveals nothing meaningful.",
