All the others  gathered around  the pit .Seeing how  _  the pit was, they told the two frogs that they might be  as good as  dead .The two frogs  _  what the other frogs were saying and  _  to jump up out of the pit with all of their physical  _  . The other frogs kept telling them to stop. In the end one of the frogs  gave up  trying , fell down and died.  _  , the second frog kept jumping as hard as she could despite the  _  remarks. Finally, with one giant leap, she  _  it out of the pit! This amazing  _  was that the second frog was  _  and unable to hear what the others had been saying. She thought they had been  _  her on the whole time they were yelling! The story above  _  us two lessons: Firstly ,there is  _  of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to someone who is  _  can lift them up and help them make it through the day. Secondly, a negative word to someone who is down can be  _  it takes to kill them. The power of words is great. Facing others' criticism or laughter, we should turn a deaf  _  to it and have a positive attitude. Thus we can reach our goals just as the second frog did .In one word, we need the  _  to guide us to the proper way , so as not to be blindly  _  by worldly opinion in difficult times.",
