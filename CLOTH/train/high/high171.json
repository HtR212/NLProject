But then I had five lovely children: Matthew and Marvin, the twins Alisa and Alan, and then Helen. I was too  _  raising them to grow a garden. Money was tight ,as well as time. When my children were little, if they wanted something that  _  too much I'd have to say, \"Do you see a money  _  outside? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know.\" Finally, all five got through high school and college, and started living on their own. And I started thinking again about having a  _  . One spring morning, on Mother's Day, I  looked out of  the window and was surprised to see a new tree in my yard. I put my glasses on and I couldn't believe what I was looking at.

There was also a(an)  _  attached : \" Love, Marvin.\" My other  _  had bought me tools, ornaments and gardening books. That was three years ago. My garden is now very  _  , just the way I wanted.
