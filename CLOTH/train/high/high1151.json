Two were   _   named Sniff and Scurry and two were little people named Hem and Haw. \n    Every morning, the mice and the little people   put on  their running wear and went to Cheese Station C   _   they found their cheese. It was such a large store of cheese that Hem and Haw     _   moved their homes to be closer to it. \n    One morning, Sniff and Scurry arrived at Cheese Station C and discovered there was   _    cheese. They weren't surprised.   _   they had noticed the supply   _   cheese had been getting smaller every day, they were prepared for the result. They set out quickly to   search for   new cheese. \n    Later that same day, Hem and Haw arrived. \"What? No cheese! Who moved my cheese?\" Hem yelled. They went home that night  _   and discouraged. \n    The next day Hem and Haw  _   to Cheese Station C. But the situation hadn't changed. Haw asked, \"Do Sniff and Scurry know something we don't know?\" Hem  laughed at  him and said, \"What would they know? They are simple   animals   and we are human beings. They cannot be    smarter   than we are.\" \n    Haw suggested, \"Maybe we should   _   talking about the situation and just to look for some new cheese.\" \n    Haw decided to   _   Cheese Station C while Hem was more comfortable staying in the cheeseless Station C. \n    Meanwhile, Sniff and Scurry went farther   _   they found Cheese Station N. They found what they had been looking for. It was the biggest   _   of cheese the mice had ever seen.",
