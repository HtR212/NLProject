As I  _  to the hospital, I was feeling sad and certainly wasn't on top of my game. As I approached the hospital, I began my   _   for a parking spot. I finally found one not too far from the entrance to the hospital.\nAs I got out and brought my change out of my pocket, I noticed a man looking a little  _  standing in front of a parking meter( ) two cars away. He seems to be searching his pockets for what I supposed were  _  for the meter.\nAlthough I  _  didn't feel that great, I thought that I should at least go over to him and find out if I could  _  him. As I approached him, he turned to me looking worried. I asked him if he had a problem I could help with. He said that he had no coins at all   _  he was only thinking about visiting his sick wife when he left his house.\nI reached into my pocket and  _  out two dollars and gave it to him without saying a word. And, without waiting for a  _  , I turned on my heel and said to him as I was walking away:\"Have a good day.\"\nThe funny thing was that I felt a lot   _  , a small smile came to my face, and second to walk just a little quicker. I was walking away when he called out:\"Thank you so much.\"You know, I didn't even   _  him to say anything. He didn't have to say a word to me. It was simply enough to   _  that I had helped someone else who needed a little   _  . That's all it took to bring a smile to my face as I went on toward completing my own business.\nYou know, it doesn't  _  much to help someone else.",
