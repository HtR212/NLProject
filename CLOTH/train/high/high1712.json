    "article": "A successful scientist is generally a good observer. He makes full   _  of the facts he observes. He doesn't accept ideas which are not   _  on obvious facts, and therefore refuses to accept authority as the only23 _ for truth. He always   _  ideas carefully and makes experiments to prove them. The rise of   _  science may perhaps be considered to26 _ as far back as the   _  of Roger Bacon, the wonderful philosopher of Oxford, who lived   _  the years 1214 and 1292. He was probably the first in the middle   _  to suggest that we must learn science30 _ observing and experimenting on the things around us, and he himself 31 _ many important discoveries. Galileo, however, who lived more than 300 years later (1564-1642), was the greatest of several great men,   _  in Italy, France, Germany, or England, began by33 _ to show how many important34 _ could be discovered by observation. Before Galileo, learned men believed that large bodies fell more 35 _ towards the earth than small ones,   _  Aristotle said so. But Galileo, going to the   _   of the leaning Tower of Pisa, let fall two 38 _ stones and proved Aristotle was wrong. It was Galileo's39 _ of going direct to Nature, and proving our 40 _ and theories by experiment, that has led to all the discoveries of modern science.",
