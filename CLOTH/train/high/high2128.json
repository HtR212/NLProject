    "article": "Now that I am no longer young, I have friends whose mothers have passed away. I have heard these sons and daughters say they never fully appreciated their mothers  _  it was too late to tell them. I am blessed with the dear mother who is still alive. I  _  her more each day. My mother does not change, but I  _  . As I grow older and wiser, I realize  _  an exceptional person she is. How  _  that I am unable to speak these words in her  _  , but they flow easily from my pen. How does a daughter begin to thank her mother for life itself? For the love, patience and just  _  hard work that go into  _  a child? For running after a toddler , for understanding a  _  teenager, for tolerating (;) a college student who knows  _  ? For waiting for the day when a daughter  _  how wise her mother really is? How does a  _  woman thank a mother for  _  to be a mother? For being ready  _  advice (when asked) or remaining  _  when it is most appreciated? For not saying, \"I told you so,\" when she could have uttered these words  dozens of times  ? For being  _  herself-loving, thoughtful, patient, and forgiving? I don't know how, dear God, except to ask you to bless her as richly as she  _  and to help me live up to the example she has  _  . I pray that I will look as good in the eyes of my children as my mother  _  in mine.",
