    "article": "The professor's house, big and untidy, stood alone at one end of a huge garden. The place was totally uncared for, quite  _  and overgrown with all sorts of useless things. I  _  my way through bushes and tall weeds to the front door and rang the bell. I was glad that I found him. In twenty minutes he put me right on all the  _  that had puzzled me. I was on the  _  of leaving when I looked out of his study window and said, \"You're very fond of gardening, I see\" \"No, I'm not,\" he said. \"  Even so  , I love this garden, though. It's  _  I always wanted it to be. I never touch it  _  all.\" \"It could be made lovely. It seems a pity to let all this ground go to  _  But perhaps you don't  _  that way?\" said I. \"I don't. I lived here when I was a child, and I had  _  of gardening then. It was my father's hobby, you see. Unfortunately, he wasn't  _  enough to do it himself. My brother and I did all of it between us year after year. There was one right way and many wrong ways. Each blade of grass was an enemy to be  _  out by hand, not just cut off. I've spent a good part of life at work here.\" \"I see. You took a dislike to it, and now you're getting even!\" \"I dislike it. Then, of course, I didn't understand the effect it had. It used to  _  me. It appeared in my  _  ------ a mistake here, something not quite straight here, the enemy showing its head in a place I was  _  to have cleaned. The work was too much. It seemed endless. The size of the place was itself a fight to a boy.\" \"And now it's yours, you're just letting it go to ...\" \"  _  ?\" he said. \"No, I don't agree with that. This garden and I are now the best friends. I like  _  it grow in its own way. I make no  _  on it. I never disturb it, and it never disturbs me. It has  _  at last, and so have I.\" \"But the path is over grown. It's  _  for you, isn't it?\" \"That's part of my pleasure,\" he laughed. \"You can go out the back way. The weeds are shorter there because they don't get the sun.\"",
