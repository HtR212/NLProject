A mountain club gives special recognition to  anyone  who climbs all the 46 mountains. My two friends decided to go for this  _  . The mountains were really  _  to climb. It  _  them several years to achieve it. My friends had climbed 45 of the mountains, and the  _  one was the most distant and the highest. Early one morning they left their campsite hiking path to the  _  of a chain of mountains. When they reached the base, they found that they had left their  _  and map in the camp.  Rather than  returning to the camp, they decided to navigate(,) without them.  _  , they reached the top of a mountain. They were worn-out  _  extremely happy. However, the  _  lasted only for a short time. When they  looked around  , they saw another higher mountain. They had climbed the  _  mountain!  Due to  the time problem, they had to wait for another four months to climb the right mountain. I think this story tells an important  _  :often in life we put great  _  into some of our goals, but without the right map and compass, it is easy to get  _  . Knowing your  _  in life gives you a powerful personal map and compass,  making sure  that you are always climbing the right mountain.",
