After class we go for lunch to the  dining hall  .Some students in their third and fourth  _  have afternoon classes,afterschool activities or driving lessons.\nAfter school I sometimes go shopping or just   _   around the town for a while.When I get home I like to   _   for some time, I listen to music or watch TV. Then I start my homework or help with some housework.\nI  _  eat dinner at about seven o'clock. At dinner my family  _  what happened during the day.  _  dinner,I watch TV or go surfing or watch a film or a video.I usually manage to go to   _   around half past ten.\nWhat do you think of my  _  ?",
