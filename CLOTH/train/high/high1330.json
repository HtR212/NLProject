One day, I came back home from work and found it was facing the window  _  . I thought it was my husband who played a  _  on me, but he did not admit. I  _  the doll to face the living room again.\nThe next day, the  _  thing happened. But this time, my husband was so  _  that I believed he had not done that. There was no  _  of anyone breaking into the house while we were away. And there was no reason to  _  that someone stole into the house just to turn the doll and left. What happened not only  _  us but also frightened us.\nThe doll kept turning every day  _  Saturdays and Sundays when I was at home. I began to wonder if there was a ghost.\nThen  _  a school holiday, and I didn't go to work. While exercising in the living room, I  _  the doll was turning by itself! It was very frightening but I  _  knew why it was turning. There was a construction site right next to the building where I  _  . The construction was at the stage of pile driving   and our building shook  _  with each pounding  .  _  I lived on the top floor, the shaking was quite strong.  As a result  , the doll moved little by little with the shaking. This also  _  why the doll never turned on Saturdays and Sundays,  _  there was no construction work at weekends. If I had not been home on a weekday, I would never have  found out  the truth.",
