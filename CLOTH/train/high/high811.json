I was halfway through   _   it, and I certainly didn't want to be   _  .But the phone kept ringing, so I    _    it.\n         Patty from my church said, \"Rachel, we are    _    at the soup kitchen   at the Methodist church this afternoon and need   _    right now. Are you    _  ?\"\n        I wanted to have an entire day to read the book,   _   my mouth answered, \"Sue, I will be there at 5:15.\"\n        When I    _  , other volunteers were already at work. I glanced through the door and saw people already lining up outside.\n        At 5:30, the    _    began to move. A family with two kids in wheelchairs came through first. The mother and father each carried two plates and 45 _   a wheelchair.\n         Then two older men came over. \"No watermelon,\" one said.\n         \"Are you kidding?\" I asked   _  . \"You don't want watermelon?\"\n         He grinned  . \"I am kidding.

I'm only hungry for watermelon.\" I   _    and served him another slice  .\n    One   _   came through holding hands and smiling at each other. \"We have been married 49 years, and I love her like I did when we just got married!\" the man told me   _   .\n         Although the people   _    food, they gave me more than I gave them. They told me about their    _   --how one's daughter was getting married, and another's son was learning to read.\n          I kept watching them eating, happy or sad, talking excitedly with friends or eating 54 _      in the corner, each with a story to tell.\n         Although I love to read Harry Potter, I'm still   _   I went to the soup kitchen that afternoon.",
