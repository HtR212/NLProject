And good health may add years to a person's life.\n              Scientists have been   looking at   the tie between pets and health for years. In 1990, a study was done with people aged 65 and older. It   _   that pet owners went to the doctor less than people   _   pets. Do pets make people   _  ? Are people able to handle their everyday lives better? Alan Beck, who is a researcher, says that   _   the answer to the questions is yes, then having pets may be a good idea.\n              Can pets also help people live longer? Rebecca Johnson did a study to   find out  . Johnson teaches nurses how to care for   _   people. Her study shows that having pets may cause people to   _   more slowly.                    \nThe human body makes many chemicals. Some of the chemicals make people feel   _  . Others make people feel bad. In Johnson's   _  , levels of the \"good\" chemicals   _   when people were around pets while levels of the \"bad\" chemicals went down. The good  _   seemed to slow the aging of cells. If this is   _  , maybe people should spend more time with their   _  . Then people might feel better and   _   longer.\nYou might be allergic  to pets. Or you may not want to 57 care for  a pet. Never fear. A robotic, or computer pet may be just the thing for you.\nScientists are testing computer pets, like the robotic dog AIBO. They want to see if   _   pets can help people the way   _   dogs do.\nWill a robotic pet   _   the real pet sitting with you on the sofa? Something tells us that it will probably become a reality.",
