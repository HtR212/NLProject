Obviously 3  _   of something, he hurried into the inner room, leaving the 4   _   on the table. His two guests heard a box of drawers opening and a rustling .\nThey 5   _   sitting in the living-room, the 10-year-old daughter, looking at the flowers outside the window. The father was just about to take his cup when the 6   _   came, right there in the living room. Something was hopelessly broken.\nIt was the thermos, which had fallen to the floor. The girl looked 7   _   her shoulder at once, startled , 8  _  . It was 9   _  .Neither of them had touched it, not even a little bit. The sound caused the host to rush back from the inner room. He looked at the 10  _   floor and blurted out , \"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter!\"\nThe father started to say something. Then he muttered , \" Sorry, I 11  _   it and it fell.\"\n\"It doesn't matter,\" the host said.\nLater, when they left the house the daughter said, \"Daddy, I saw your 12   _   in the windowpane . You were sitting perfectly13  _  . Why did you say...?\"\nThe father 14  _  , \"What then would you 15  _   as the cause of its fall?\"\n\"It fell by itself. The floor is uneven .

The truer your story is, the less true it sounds.\"\nThe daughter was 19  _   in silence for a while. Then she said, \"Can you 20  _   it only this way?\"\n\"Only this way,\" the father said.",
