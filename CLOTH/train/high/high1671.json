    "article": "For most people, graduation is an exciting day, but my graduation day was not. I remember that weekend two years ago. Family and friends had flown in from across the country to  _  the celebration. But just like everyone else in my class, I had watched the  _  turn from bad to worse in my senior year. Almost all of us graduates had degrees, but very uncertain  _  . The weeks ahead weren't  _  . I knew my small university town couldn't offer me any opportunities,  _  I packed up my car and drove to Southern California to find work. But what I thought would take a  _  dragged into two, and then four, and 100 job applications later, I found myself in the exact same  _  as I was before.

After that, things slowly began to fall into  _  . I was offered a second book deal. Then, a few months later, I got an interview with the Walt Disney Company and was  _  shortly after. Don't give up. Even if things look  _  now, don't give up. If you work hard, things will always get better. Often times our dreams lie in wait just a little further upstream ... all we need is the  _  to push beyond the river.",
