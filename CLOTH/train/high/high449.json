Grandma Rose was   telling  stories,\npartly in Chinese and partly in English. Linda couldn't  _  much\nher grandma's native tongue, but she could understand almost every  _  .\nAs the lunch drew to a close, a plate of fortune cookies was   _  to\nthe table. Grandma Rose took the  _  and\noffered one to her daughter, took one for herself, and passed\nthe  _  one to Linda. As\nshe  _  it from the plate, it felt  _  than expected, and when she opened it, she knew  _  . A beautiful heart had somehow been stored inside it, along with the\nnormal fortune strip . Linda read the little strip around the   _  : \"Small\nheart, Close heart. \"\nLinda looked with confusion at her grandmother. \"I was going to write it in Chinese, but I    _  you couldn't read it,\" Grandma Rose said with a grin.\nLinda spoke the words out loud: \"Small heart, Close heart.\" Then it   _  her:\nIn Chinese, word characters are combined to  _  other ideas. Small heart were the two Chinese words that together  _  \" be careful\".Close hearton the other hand meant \"to\ncare for  _  \".\n\"But what does it means, Grandma Rose?\" Linda asked.\nRose took off her glasses. \"That heart was a   _  from my grandmother\nwhen my family moved to Singapore and she asked me to do two things in my  _  home. Be careful  _  \nbe full of care. Small heart,Close heart.\" Rose said the last words in Chinese. As she said the words, she\ntightened her  _  hand into a fist while placing her\nleft hand, fully opened on her heart. \"It means be careful of things and people\nthat may  _  you, but never stop caring.\nThese are the two most important things you must do as you go on to college.\"",
