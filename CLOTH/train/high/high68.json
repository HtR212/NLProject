We called it our\"rock  _  \"as there were so many rocks here. Whenever\npossible,we would stick some plants out front, just to bring some  _  to the area.\nLast summer I had reached the end of the garden and found a(n)   _  little plant\nthat I could not  _  identify .I knew I didn't   _  it and my wife said that she didn't either. We decided to let it  _  growing until we could figure out what it was.\nWeeks passed and as I made my way  _  to the strange plant,it appeared to be a sunflower. It was spindly standing with a tall skinny stalk and only one head on it. I decided to care for it,but as I  _  weeds and rocks from the area,I noticed something   _  .The sunflower had not  _  where I saw the  _  .It  _  had begun under a big rock and grown\nunder and around it to reach the  _  .\nThat's when I realized that if a tiny sunflower did n' t  _  a big\nrock stand in its way of developing,we too have the  _  to do the same thing . Once our environment begins to see that we\nbelieve in ourselves  _  that little sunflower,we can  _  the same nourishment and nurturing as well. \n   _  tall like the sunflower and be   _  of who and what you are and the environment will begin to  _  you. You will find a way to go under or around your big barriers in order\nto reach your desires.",
