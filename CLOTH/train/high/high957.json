When I slept, I would dream of living it; when I   got up  , I would work for living it.\nOne day, somebody told me, \"To   _   is better than to arrive.\" Hearing this, I   _   laughed it off, not quite understanding how that was even   _  . And I didn't realize how true it was   _   I had what I wanted. Then I suddenly realized that the person living the dream was different from the one who had   _   for it. Since then, I have made a great   _   to work for the realization of my dream.   _  , I achieved what I had wanted. I have now become a wiser, calmer, stronger and more passionate person.\nThe journey has   _   me a lot. I made mistakes and learned from them. I   fell down   and learned to get up again. I cried and I learned to wipe away my tears. I made friends and learned to   _   people. I made enemies and learned to value   _  . The journey has transformed a caterpillar   into a beautiful butterfly, eagerly waiting to   _   the world with her newly-found wings.\nWe all know that our   _   isn't as perfect as it is in the fairy tales. It   _   great ambition and courage to fulfill our dreams. But we should remember that even if   _   gets in our way, nothing will   _   us.\nSo friends, always remember: \"Experience is the best   _   and there are no guarantees that one will become an artist. Only the   _   matters.\" So let's drink to a new journey. Cheers!",
