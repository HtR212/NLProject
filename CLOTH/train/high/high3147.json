But, other times, I can't help but feel a little  _  because I seldom had any plans for myself, and everyone knew it.

One day, when the kids were at school, I  _  for the movie theater-alone, I'd  _  been to the movies alone before, so I was a little nervous. Would I look pitiful going to the theater by myself? Was I being ridiculous by seeing a movie  _  so much work waited for me at home? I  _  myself to swallow these  _  and bought myself a ticket.
