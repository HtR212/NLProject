The overall picture still looked good but I couldn't  _  whether or not changing the frame would make it better.\nFrom this an interesting  _  came to mind. At times when I was  _  I would spend money on clothes. Maybe I spend it on other things as well.\nBecause I have a love for  _  , I thought I would feel good. However, the feeling was always  _  . Why? Because doing this didn't  _  the real issue. What I needed to do was to pay attention to what was bothering me on the inside  instead of  trying to cover up my problems by making changes on the outside. I was changing the frame but the picture on the  _  was still the same.\nWe may change the  _  of our hair or even buy new clothes. There is nothing wrong with doing this  _  , but if it is being done for the wrong reasons, it may not  make a difference  to how we really feel. If you  _  there is something wrong, try to change that; this way you will truly feel better on the inside.  _  time with family, having a conversation with a friend, or even letting your pen write your innermost feelings can  _  . Eventually, you will get true peace and joy inside. This way, not only will you be better able to  _  your life but also display colorful images of love for others.\nSo  _  necessary, don't just change the frame. Change the picture. Getting a new picture may be  _  and may take time; however, with  _  it can be accomplished. In the end, playing your part in building a  _  of even more fine art in this world would be worth it!",
