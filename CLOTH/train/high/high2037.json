I made my first   wood house  out of a branch and a piece of pipe.Then I hammered an empty tin can into the shape of a ball.And finally I dug two small   _  in the ground and hit the ball back and forth.I practiced with the same devotion and intensity.I learned working in the field ?but now I was   picking up  golf balls with a club , not oxen with a broomstick.",
