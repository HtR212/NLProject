When I passed by a  _  shop, an  _  came to my mind, \"I'll send Mum some roses.\" While I was  picking  my flowers, a young man went inside. \"How many roses can I get  _  only five dollars, Madam?\" he asked. The assistant was trying to tell him roses were as  _  as forty dollars a dozen---- Maybe he would be happy with carnations . \" No, I  have to  have red roses,\" he said, \"my mum was  badly  ill last year and I didn't spend much time with her. Now I want to get something special, roses, as rose is her  _  .\" After hearing it, I said I would pay  the rest  of the money for the young man.  _  by both of us, the assistant said, \"well, lovely young men, thirty dollars a dozen, only for you.\" Taking the roses, the young man almost jumped into the  _  and ran out of the shop. It was  _  worth twenty-five dollars I paid to see the exciting  _  . Then I paid for my dozen of roses and told the assistant to  _  them to my mother. As I walked out, I felt  _  . Suddenly I saw the young man crossing the street and going into a park. But soon I  realized  it was not a park  _  a cemetery.

God, please help me find my mum and tell her I love her.\" Seeing this, I turned and quickly walked to the  _  . I would take the flowers home myself.",
