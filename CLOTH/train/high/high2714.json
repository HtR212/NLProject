Three months   _  , he had begun a one-year assignment in South Korea. David made an effort to sound   _  , but his voice suggested homesickness.\n38 _  a booming clap of thunder shook the windows only inches  _  the phones Pat and I were using.\n\"What was that?\" David asked, \"It sounded like a(n)   _  .\"\n\"Just thunder,\" Pat said, \"It's been raining here all week.\"\nThere were several seconds of   _  . \"David,\" I asked, \"Are you still there?\"\n\"I was   thinking about   what Mother said-'Just thunder.'  Other than   parents, do you know what many of the men here  _   most of all? Thunder. We have rain, wind, snow and some violent storms, but it  _  thunders.\"\n\"I wish I were there now to listen with you,\" he said softly.\n  As soon as  I hung up the phone, I got my tape recorder, my large umbrella and a wooden chair and   _   out. I sat in the driving rain under my umbrella and   _   half an hour of the finest Mississippi thunder a   _  man could ever want to hear. The next day I mailed the tape to David with a single line: \"A(n)  _  gift.\"\nThree weeks later David called again, \"Dad,\" he said, \"You won't  _  what I did last night. I   _  some friends over to my quarters for a thunder party. When we heard the tape, we all   _   the same way. Instant silence, followed by a few minutes of   _  . But once we realized we were listening to the sounds of   _  , we felt better and enjoyed a great party. I can't tell you how much that tape meant to me.\"",
