I'm Mr. Stevens and I'm sure I'll learn all your names in no time.\" He walked around the class   handing out  math books. When\nhe was done, he  _  to the front of the class and\nlooked at us. We stared   back. \"What are you   _  for? Get\nstarted!\" He said.\nWe looked at him --  _  . Wasn't he going to teach us?\n\"Is there something wrong with your   _  ? You're not all deaf, are you?\"\nOne   _  boy\nat the back of the class asked what we all wanted to know. \"Mr. Stevens,\naren't you going to teach us?\"\n\"Rubbish!\" Mr. Stevens   _  . \"You're smart kids. Open your books and get to it. If you have any  _  , raise your hand, and I'll help you.\"\nMr. Stevens helped anyone who was   _  in a problem. He would stop us to teach\nall the students  _  when we all had the same\nquestion. It was a  _  method of teaching, but it\nwas very useful.\nIt was a   _  point in my life. Mr. Stevens made me  _  I\nwas good at math and also able to reach the  _  of\nany class I attended. I studied with his help until I graduated from middle\nschool.\nMonty Python's Flying Circus was a popular television show back then. Mr. Stevens would often act out one of their plays in front of the class. Some   _  he\nwas strange, and I guess he was,  _  he knew how\nto make a math lesson interesting.\nI've carried his   _  with me all my life. Whenever I am faced with a new  _  , I think of my first day in grade six math.  Instead of  sitting\nand staring at the challenge, I just get started.  _  I\nknow it, the challenge has been settled.",
