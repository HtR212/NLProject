She promised she wasn't a beggar and  _  she just had no food for her baby.\n   I just   _  her as a beggar. In my pocket I had one pound eighty pence in change and a\ntwenty-pound note. This was  _  I had for the rest of\nthe weekend. I gave her the change and  _  on.\nThen I heard her saying something and I turned  _  .\n\"Sorry, but this isn't going to buy much baby food, is it?\"\n       For a second her words really made me  _  . After all, her baby wasn't\nmy  _  . Part of my mind screamed that she was just\ntrying to take me for a  _  .\n       But what if she wasn't?\n       There and then I had to  _  what kind of person I was going to be.
