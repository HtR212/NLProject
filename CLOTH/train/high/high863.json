    "article": "I guess this has a lot to do   _   your current English knowledge,   _   pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and   _   of English. I do not agree with learning a language in a short time. How short? One week? One month? It is hard to say.\nIf you are really interested in English, you will surely make progress if you keep working on it; if you are not interested and don't   _   with it at all, it will become really difficult. To speak   _  English is not too difficult   _   you practice enough with   _   ; but to speak perfect English, or, in other words, to speak English as well as you speak Chinese, will be very, very  _  .\n49 _ , I think I speak English well,   _  I can express  _  clearly and accurately in English. But I am not at all satisfied, as each time I speak I feel that it is not a language  _    my own, that it is different from I speak Chinese! \nTherefore, I am a little   _  . But I won't give up trying. I wish that I could really feel that I am using this language as I use Chinese someday. How much longer time I need  _   I achieve this goal is yet to be   _   out. \nLast, let me reassure you that it is not difficult to speak English well if you keep practicing! Easier said than done. Not many people can keep going, and there are  another   major group of people who are always   _   with opening up their mouth to utter their first English sentence.   Once   they succeed, they will   get over   the first stumbling block, and it is not too long before they can   _   themselves!",
