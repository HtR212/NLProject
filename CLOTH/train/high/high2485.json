    "article": "One Sunday, a picture in the newspaper touched me. A young woman stood in front of a totally destroyed home. A little boy stood beside her with his head  _  . Holding her skirt tightly was a tiny girl, eyes wide with  _  and fear. With growing  _  I noticed that their sizes of each family member closely  _  ours. This would be a good opportunity to  _  my children, so I explained their difficult  _  to my seven-year-old twins and three-year-old Meghan. \"We have so much, but these poor people now have nothing,\" I said, \"we'll  _  what we have with them.\" I brought three large boxes and placed them on the living room floor. Meghan watched seriously  _  the boys and I filled one box with canned food. While I  sorted through  our clothes, I encouraged the boys to go through their toys and  _  some of their less favorite things. Meghan watched  _  as the boys piled up useless toys in the box. \"I'll help you find something for the little girl,\" I said to her. The boys placed the toys they had  _  to donate into one of the boxes while I filled the third box with clothes. Meghan walked up with Lucy, her worn, faded, much-loved doll  _  tightly to her chest. She  _  in front of the box, pressed her little face into Lucy's face, gave her a  _  kiss, then, laid her gently on top of the other toys. \"Oh, honey,\" I said. \"You  don't have  to give away Lucy. You love her so much.\" Meghan nodded, eyes shining with tears. \"Lucy makes me happy, Mommy.  _  she'll make that little girl happy, too.\" I stared at Meghan for a long moment,  _  how I could teach the boys the lesson she had just taught me. It's easy to give what we don't want any more, but  _  to let go of things we cherish, isn't it?  _  , the true spirit of giving is to give with your heart.",
