    "article": "Douglas was my cousin. I first met him when he came to stay with my family for a  _  , because his parents were going to teach in Africa. He and his family lived on the other side of the country, so we had never had a chance to visit. However, when we arrived at the airport, it was not hard to find which person was my  _  . He was the one standing all alone, looking around for someone to  _  him. He looked a little scared to meet us, but started to smile shyly after my mom hugged him. When we got back home and Douglas started  putting away  his things, I could not believe it. All of his  _  were the same, all white shirts and dark blue shorts. \"How can you  _  only one kind of clothes?\" I asked him. \"That's the way my school has always been,\" he said. \"We have to wear uniforms.\" \"I would hate having to wear the  _  thing every day.\" \"I don't mind,\" Douglas said. \"It  _  time. I don't have to think about what I am going to wear.\" \"Well we don't wear uniforms at our  _  . You're going to look pretty funny if you come to school in a jacket and tie . Douglas looked worried.  _  , I felt bad. I had not meant to hurt him. After all, it was not easy to come to live with some  _  family for a year. Then and there I decided that I was going to  look after  my cousin and try to make this as good a year as possible for him.\"",
