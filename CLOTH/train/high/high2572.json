    "article": "\"My wallet!Where is it?\"were my first words when I found out my wallet was lost.I searched my memory for a few good seconds,and then   _   that I had left my precious wallet in the library.To be   _   ,it was in the public toilet of the library!\n  _   the library was then closed,I had to wait until the next morning to begin my     _   .When I got there early the next day,all I found was a   _   bathroom.\nAt that time,all I could   hope for   was that the person who cleaned the restroom had   _   my wallet.So I   _   approached an old lady at the front desk.\"Excuse me,is there a wallet found in the restroom yesterday?\"She walked through a door and   _   for a moment.Then she came back to the desk.\"No,\"she said.I quickly thanked her and walked off,50 _ .\nFinally,I painfully   _   the fact that my wallet had gone.\nA week later,I received a mysterious 52 _  in the mail.Sure enough,it was my   _   ! And most surprisingly,54 _  in it was missing! And there was a little yellow piece of paper folded up inside.I slowly unfolded it and a little medal of Christ fell off.The paper   _   like his:\nAlways   _   this medal with you,whatever your religion is,so the angel that was watching over you last   _   will always be close.\nThis person didn't even leave a return   _   ,so I couldn't thank whoever it was.\nFrom that day on,I promised myself to   _   this example when I was in a similar situation.I will make others as   _   as I was when I opened that package !",
