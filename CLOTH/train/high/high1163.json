After a few minutes I noticed that her legs were  _  slightly. She was looking around so that she could find a  _  to sit down. She asked a few guys to let her sit because she had a problem with her knees. Nobody responded to her  _  , so she was feeling helpless.\nI noticed that she was experiencing a lot of  _  , which made me feel bad. I was fighting in my mind about whether I should give her my seat. I found it wasn,t easy to make a  _  at that moment. I must give her my seat! But what if she thought I did something wrong? How would I  _  if others said something unpleasant to me? But what if my mother was in this condition? Then I wouldn,t  _  to give my seat to my mother. Yes, I should help the old lady!\nBut before I could stand to ask the lady to take my seat, an old man stood and  _  his seat to her.
