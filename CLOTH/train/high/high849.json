    "article": "Two weeks before Christmas, Mother told me we were going to my grandmother's house for the holiday. Grandma and Uncle Henry lived on a farm some 15 miles out of town They had no electricity or running water and  _  what I considered the \"good things\" in life. They  _  made no plans for Christmas When Christmas Eve arrived, Mom told me in her best \"I-mean-it\" voice to  _  all the decorations from our tree. She packed those up  along with  all the materials for a  _  turkey dinner. Christmas morning  _  perfectly with the sun shining brightly across a fresh blanket of snow.  _  I was angry silently in the backseat of the car as we made our  _  to grandma's. This was going to be the  _  Christmas ever! Grandma was  _  to see us as we walked up to her door. \"What on earth are you doing here?\" she said.\" We weren't expecting  anyone  . It's Christmas, and I don't even have a turkey to cook for you.\" \"I knew  _  \" Mom said as we set boxes of goodies on the kitchen table. \"That's  _  we brought all with us.\" \"We  _  have a tree\" Mom insisted. \"  Or rather  what will we do with all these decorations?\" Uncle Henry quickly caught Mom's spirit. He called me to join him, and we found a perfect Christmas tree in the woods. Soon the house  _  fresh and piney as we decorated the pine tree, and the day  took on  a festive air . The turkey dinner was very good, too. I was actually beginning to enjoy this unusual Christmas day! Dessert was almost forgotten  _  Mom came out with the final surprise-a flaming pudding! \"Merry Christmas, mother,\" Mom said. \"Dear me!\" Grandma said with her mouth wide open. \"I haven't seen a flaming pudding since I left England before I was married.\" Tears of  _  filled her eyes. I could not keep the tears  _  my eyes, either. I knew then that Mom had also given me the best Christmas present ever. She had taught me what a beautiful thing it is to give.",
