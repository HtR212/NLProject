We met playing baseball when we were eight years old. We  went through  life's ups and downs together. He was 26 when he died.\nI was in  _  when I found out the situation. Friends of his  _  photos and information on his page, and I set up a way for people to  _  money to Sean's wife, Amanda, and their son, right through Facebook.\nMy sister is a journalist, and she suggested that we arrange everything  _  while the fire was getting national  _  . In the first couple of days, Sean's page got 2, 000 likes. Today it has more than 27, 000 likes.\nWhen Sean's family drove his ashes 500 miles from Prescott, Arizona, to his  _  in Santa Ynez, California, firefighters had been standing on every highway overpass  .\nI was surprised at how much it  _  me to see that other people cared. Strangers were sending Facebook messages,  _  baby clothes to Amanda and we've  _  about  $10, 000 for his son's education. One post is from a little boy in Nevada who said, when he  grows up  he wants to be a firefighter. It  _  touched me. People posted messages about what a hero Sean was and they were right. There is a lot of  _  on that Facebook page. I  _  one day, when Sean's son, Sean Jaxon, is  _  enough, he will see how  _  his father was through this page.\nDuring moments when I miss Sean, I visit the  _  , and it makes me smile. On my birthday or his birthday or some  _  date, I'll read the messages and look at the photos that people have posted. It's a way for me to keep his memory  _  .",
