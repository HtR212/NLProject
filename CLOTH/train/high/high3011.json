He was about to put his head under his wings when he suddenly saw a long pointed nose -- there just below him stood a fox. \"Have you heard the  _  news?\" cried the fox excitedly. \"What news?\" asked the rooster very  _  . But in fact, he was very nervous, because he was very much  _  of the fox. \"Your family and mine and all other animals have  _  to live in peace from now on and forget our  _  forever. Just think of it! I simply cannot wait to embrace you ! Do come down,dear friend, and let us  _  the exciting news.\" \"How great!\" said the rooster.\"I am certainly  _  about the news.\" But when he said this, he seemed to be looking at something far off. \"What is it you see?\" asked the fox  _  . \"Oh, a couple of  _  are coming this way. They must have heard the good news and...\" But the fox did not wait to hear more. He turned and  _  as fast as he could. \" Wait ,\" cried the rooster. \"Why do you run? The dogs are  _  of yours now!\" \"Yes,\" answered the fox . \" But they might not have heard the news.Besides, I have a very important thing that I had almost  _  about.\" Seeing this , the wise rooster smiled as he hid his head in his feathers and went to  _  , for he had succeeded in  _  a very crafty enemy. Those who cheat people are easily cheated.",
