What's more  , they make our life richer and  _  colorful. If we  _  have a strong body, we will find it hard to do  _  we want.  _  persons of all ages enjoy watching and  taking part in  various kinds of sports----track and fields, swimming, skating,  _  , volleyball and basketball, etc. Sports and games are also very useful in  _  training. They demand not only  _  skills and strength but also courage, endurance , discipline and usually teamwork. For boys and girls, what is learned in the playground often has a deep  _  on their character.  if  each of them learns to work for his team and not for himself on the football field, he will later find  _  natural to work for the good of his country  Instead of  only for his own benefit. A healthy  _  makes a strong country. Let's all take part in sports and games.",
