    "article": "I can never wipe off the memory that I met my current stepmom for the first time.After I parted with my father for ages, I moved to America and was  _  with him. In the beginning, she made sure to let me know that I was welcome in her  _  .I remember when I first saw her at the  airport  . It was different, but not  _  . Over the past years there is  _  I needed that she did not provide. I'm the young woman I'm today because she made sure to  _  me properly.Yesterday I went to see her for Mother's Day. When I gave her  _  , she held my face in both of her hands and kissed me straight on the mouth  even though  I had the flu. Her simple act of affection  _  me back to my first night in America. After I was  _  up from the airport we went home and she  _  my luggage and took me shopping for new clothes since the ones I had brought with me from Africa were a bit  _  .That night before I went to bed, she came to my room, the first room I had ever had for my own. She told me she was  _  to have me and that she would take good care of me. Before she  _  she asked me for a hug.That was my  _  first hug and I was 11 years old at that time. I'm 23 years old now and I have received many  _  over the past years, but none has given me a greater  _  or deeper impression.I regarded her as my  _  mother because my new life began when I came to  _  with her. Today I say to my mother, Mrs. Sherrill Kirundi, thank you, mom. Thank you for your giving me my  _  childhood back.",
