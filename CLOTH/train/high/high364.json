    "article": "My mother-in-law passed away when she was 76. My wife and I drove to  go through  her belongings, deciding what to keep, give away or throw out. Nettie lived on little all her life,  _  we expected no hidden fortunes, but we were  _  .\nIn early spring every year, Nettie would make a(n)  _  . \"I'm making the Easter pies,\" she would say, \"so nobody should bother me.\" Nettie wrapped the pies and labeled each for the intended  _  . Her doorbell would start ringing at noon as relatives came to  _  this family present.\nIn the fridge, my wife and I  _  some pies and looked at each other in  _  , saying nothing. Then we  took out  the pies one by one and put them in a plastic bag. We left her apartment for the last time,  _  holding the pies.\nThat night, as we  _  at the table for dinner with our children in our home, my wife  _  us the pies. I'd eaten my mother-in-law's pies for more than 20 years, and they  _  tasted good. But this time the pies tasted better than ever. With each  _  I remembered everything Nettie had meant to all of us over the years---how she had  brought up  her daughter as a single mother and loved her grandchildren. I could actually taste her kind and  _  spirit.\nAfterwards, my wife pointed towards one last pie labeled \"Nettie\". \"I'm saving this one, \"she said. There Nettie's  _  remains, untouched, unseen, but never  _  . Other families leave behind  _  stuff such as jewelry, but Nettie left us her simple pie. That single pie will be our heirloom and  _  our hearts forever.",
