    "article": "Butterfly's wings One day a small opening appeared on a cocoon , a man sat and watched for the butterfly for several hours as it was struggling to  _  its body through that little hole. Then it seemed to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten  as far as  it could and it could go no further. So the man decided to  _  the butterfly: he took a pair of scissors and  cut off  the remaining part of the cocoon. The butterfly then  came out  easily. But it has a swollen body and  _  wings. The man continued to  watch  the butterfly because he expected that, at any moment, the  _  would enlarge and expand to be able to support the body, which would  _  the time span . Neither happened!  In fact  , the butterfly spent the rest of its life  _  around with a swollen body and small, shriveled wings. It  _  was able to fly. What the man did in his  _  and haste did no good to the butterfly. He didn't know the  _  cocoon and the struggle  _  for the butterfly to get through the tiny  _  were the natural way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings  so that  it would be ready for flight once it achieved its  _  from the cocoon. Sometimes the  _  is exactly what we need in our life. If we are allowed to go through our life without any  _  , it would not be a good thing to us. We would not be as strong as what we could have been.",
