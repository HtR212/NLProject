    "article": "There is a sharing policy at my son's preschool. The policy is that a child can keep a toy as long as they want to. If another child wants the toy, they have to   _   until the first child is done with it. We are   _   \"save\" toys for the child if they have to go to the bathroom, or go to the snack table, etc. so that it won't be   _   before they are done. This applies to anything in the school that can be   played with  , including swings  and monkey bars.\nThat is the   _   that all the kids know, so they don't feel uncomfortable when you tell them, \"You can have it was Sally Joe is done.\" But    _   I've been noticing a totally different attitude towards 42 _  in other places where I go. Gradually , I'm starting to   _   why the rule of the school is important. Here is a(n)   _   of sharing practices that I've seen lately. My good friend and her   _   were at the park one day. He had 46 _  a small car from home to play with. Another child, a lot bit   _  , wanted to play with the car and was demanding that my friend's son   _   him the car. A typical little boy fighting started. I stopped them   _  . I heard the other mother told her son angrily, \"I guess his mom didn't   _   him how to share\", which I don't think so.\nI think that it is   _   to teach a child that he should have something that someone else has, simply because he wants it.   _   it belongs to someone else, not yours. If you want to share his, \"No\" is a perfectly   _   response, unless he's ready to share with you or you   _   it with something. Even if it is something public, when another is playing it, you should wait for your   _   politely. Therefore, how to share and how to treat it are important.",
