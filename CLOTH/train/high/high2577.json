When a signing event was organized for my book at its   _   sale or when I was invited to deliver a speech at a meeting, I would be   _   and cheerful, especially if there were lots of participants.\n  _  , I have never been controlled by such   _  , for I have my own idea of it. To me, a(n)   _   remains popular only for three seconds. This morning somebody   _   me on the way and said, \"Ah, that's Zhu Deyong!\" I was glad to be   _   by a stranger and enjoyed myself, \"  After all  , I am famous!\" But such enjoyments   _   only three seconds. He passed by and turned to the person walking with him, \"What shall we have for lunch?\" No   _   of me any longer. Shall I   _   my life cherishing those three seconds? Is it necessary to make efforts to   _   such three-second enjoyments? No, I don't want to.\nAs life is   _   and only comes around once, it is of great value to the person himself, but of no value to others. For most people, one's name remains   _   only for three generations: one's   _   generation, the second (your son may say \"Ah, it's my dad.\") and the third (your grandson may still   _  , \"Ah, it's my grandpa.\") If a member of the fourth generation is asked about you, he might be   _  , \"Who is it?\" If he is shown a picture of you, he might give it a glance, put it aside and   _   forget it. It amounts to nothing more than a   _   with an unknown name.",
