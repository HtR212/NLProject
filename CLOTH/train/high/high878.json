As the policeman came to him, he said, \"Hi, officer, I guess you  _  me a little bit over the speed limit. I was in a rush to get  home  , to be with my wife and kids. You know my younger son wasn't feeling too  _  when I left home this morning. I'm afraid he's ill.\" The policeman said, \"Well, I guess so,\" and started  writing  something in his notebook. As minutes went by, he could see from the side view mirror, the police-man was  _  writing. When the man was wondering why he hadn't asked for his driving  _  so far, the policeman came to his window,  _  him a piece of paper, and returned to his car without saying a single word. The man wondered: how much was this  _  going to be? However, the man was  _  it was not a ticket at all and he began to  _  : \"I had a daughter who was  _  by a speeding car at the age of six by a speeding driver. He got a fine, a few months in  _  , and then was free, free to hug his two daughters. I only had one, and now I have to  _  until I get to heaven before I can hug her again.

My son is all I have been left with.\" The man was completely  _  and could not move for the next few minutes. When finally he did, he drove  _  , even a few miles  _  the speed limit, praying for forgiveness.",
