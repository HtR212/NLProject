    "article": "It was before Christmas. The spirit of the season had not yet caught up with me. Quickly, I filled my shopping cart with some things and went to the long checkout lines. I picked the   _   one, but it looked as if it would be   at least   a 20-minute wait.\nIn front of me were   _   small children--- a boy of five and a younger girl . The girl   _   a beautiful pair of shiny, golden shoes and   _   them as though they were a treasure.\nThe clerk showed them the   _  . \"That will be $6.09,\" she said. The boy   _   some bills on the stand while he   searched   his pockets. He finally came up with $3.12. \"I guess we will come back some   _   time, maybe tomorrow.\" With that   _   the little girl began to cry. \"But Jesus would have loved these   _   ,\" she cried. \"Well, we'll go home and work some more. Don't cry. We'll come   _  .\", he told her.\nQuickly I handed $3 to the   _  . These children had waited in line for a long time and,   _   all, it was Christmas. Suddenly a pair of arms came around me and a small   _   said,\" Thank you, lady.\" The girl said. \"My Sunday teacher said that the streets in the heaven were made of shiny   _  , just like these shoes. Our mommy is sick and she is going to   _   . Daddy said that she might go before Christmas, to be with Jesus. I think my mom will be beautiful   _   in those streets to   _   these shoes.\"\nMy eyes filled with tears. Silently I thanked God for using these children to   _   me of the true spirit of giving.",
