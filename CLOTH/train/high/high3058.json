Fill in each blank with the word or phrase that best fits the context.\nAt 1:30 p.m. on March 31, 1981, John Hinckley Jr. stepped from a crowd of onlookers and tried to kill Ronald Reagan, the president of the United States. Although he failed, he did cause injury to the president. The crime was committed in clear view of many people.   _  , at the end of his trial, Hinckley was found not   _   by reason of insanity . Instead of prison, Hinckley was sent to a mental hospital, where he remains.\nThe judgment in Hinckley's case did more than annoy a few people. It   kicked off   a nationwide debate about whether people accused of a crime can claim they were insane when they did it. If they were capable of   _   and then committing a crime, how could they later claim to have been insane? One starting point is to identify what insane means in a U.S. court of law.\nVery young children cannot be   _   if they do not know right from wrong, because they cannot be held morally responsible for their actions. For most people, moral responsibility comes with age and maturity. Psychologists, however, say that there are some adults who cannot recognize right from wrong. Since these adults cannot tell the   _  , they should not be held morally responsible for their actions. In a U.S. court of law, an adult like this may be considered insane. Hinckley was judged insane because   _   determined that his mind was not functioning like a(n)   _   adult's so he had no idea what he was doing. Instead of spending the rest of his life in prison, Hinckley would be committed to a mental hospital, where he could be treated for his illness.\nPeople who are against the use of an insanity defense say that criminals like Hinckley do know what they are doing.   _   of the insanity defense say that everyone who commits a serous crime like Hinckley's could be said to be mentally ill. Otherwise, the person would not commit the crime   in the first place  . There are many people who struggle with severe mental illness who do not commit crimes. The illnesses should not be used as a(n)   _   for violent behavior.\nPeople who   _   the insanity defense believe that mental illnesses are not always treatable. Psychologists have been able to detect patterns of behavior. These mental detectives have   _   evidence that a person can be insane but seem normal. Hinckley and others with   _   conditions suffer from delusions . Even though people with delusions may seem normal, the world does not appear to them as it does to other people. Therefore, experts say, such people cannot be held to the rules of behavior other people are held to. Their punishments should be   _  .",
