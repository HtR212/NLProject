Fill in each blank with the word or phrase that best fits the contest.\n \nAvraham Kadar, a physician, faced the challenge of explaining complex medical concepts to children be was treating for many years.   In the end   , he found a solution in 1999, and teachers have been gaining the benefits ever since.\nKadar created BrainPOP, a(n)  _  program consisting of humorous animated  videos in which a man named Tim and his robot friend Moby  talk about   various subjects. The videos fall into seven types: engineering and technology, science, social studies, English, math, health, and arts and music. From historical figures to recent inventions, they cover over 500 topics,       _  interste in the subjects though   _  and illustrations. BrainPOP's materials also include quizzes, activities, answers to questions and extra information about each topic.\nBrainPOP can be used in the classroom or at home through the Internet. It is now   _     everywhere through its apps  for mobile devices. BrainPOP also supplies resources to different  _   : BrainPOP Jr, for younger students, BrainPOP Espanol for Spanish speakers and BrainPOP ESL for those learning English. Almost 20 percent of American schools have       _  BrainPOP, and its popularity is growing worldwide. Its website, apps and produces have won multiple awards from magazines, websites and other organizations.\nThe reason for BrainPOP's  _   among teachers is similar: It works. A 2009 study conducted by SEG Research compared students who used BrainPOP to those who didn't. The BrainPOP users experienced more   _    in vocabulary, reading comprehension, language skills and science than the other syudents.\nAnd the benefits of BrainPOP are not limited to  _   speakers of English. One award-winning Canadian school with students from many language backgrounds makes BrainPOP available to all its teachers. They find it  _   because it mixes pictures with its presentations instead of relying only on language.  _   , a school in the U.S. for students with learning disabilities has found BrainPOP very effective at keeping students engaged and encouraging them to participate. Teachers said taht BrainPOP's quick pace and humor help students   _   interruptions and continue to focus. The kids love the teacher Moby, a robot that cannot speak but communicates with facial expressions and beeps . For more than 10 years, BrainPOP's fun, lear and educational materials have helped students learn---and   _   it.",
