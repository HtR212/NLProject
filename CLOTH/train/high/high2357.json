    "article": "I have learnt a lot about Chinese life and culture while teaching in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province and found them very interesting. First, family life is quite  _  . In the USA, many young people  _  home after they finish their education and start working. However, in China, it is  _  for people to live with their parents until they get married.  _  , many of my Chinese friends told me that their  _  lived with them and helped take care of them when they were children. It seems that Americans think independence is more important  _  the Chinese think family relationships are more important. Bargaining is another  _  that I have tried to learn. In the USA, prices are  _  and you can't ask for a lower price. However in some small Chinese stores and tourist places, you are  _  to bargain. My Chinese friends taught me to ask for 40 percent or 50 percent  _  the original price. If the salesperson doesn't agree to my price, I should  _  to leave and he might let me come back and sell me the item. It is a skill that you have to  _  if you live in China. Tipping hasn't been easier to  adjust to  . In the USA, many people in the service  _  want to get  _  money for serving customers. Tipping is not a part of Chinese culture.  _  I tried to tip a taxi driver. He looked a little  _  and refused to take the money. In dinners, perhaps what surprises an American visitor most is that some of the Chinese hosts like to put food into the plates of their  _  . Actually, this is a  _  of true friendship and politeness. My Chinese friend told me if I didn't want to eat it, I should just  _  the food in the plate.",
