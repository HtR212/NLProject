As my husband was packing, I noticed he'd placed my 31 _  in the luggage crate  on top of the car. I said that maybe he should   _   it. He turned and said, \"It'll be   _  . Trust me! It won't come off.\"\nHalfway home we had a car come racing up beside us and the driver   _   us down. She said she'd seen a red suitcase on the side of the road several kilometers back and was\n   _   if it was ours. We looked   _   and, to our 37 _   , discovered that the case had flown off.\n              We raced back, but the case was   _  . We visited the local police station, but as the road was a common link between several towns, we weren't very   _  . We put it all down to our bad   _   .\n              Seven years later, my father got a(n)   _   from a lady asking if I'd lost a red suitcase. Her husband had   picked up   the case abandoned on the side of the road. He assumed he'd be able to find an address or name somewhere inside and   _   it later. On opening the case, they'd found the wedding cards, no address, and no way of   _   who we were. They'd spent seven years moving around the area, always taking the suitcase with them.\n              They were about to   _   again and decided to give it one more   _   before leaving. This time, on opening the jewellery box, they 47 _  a piece of paper folded up in it\n-- -- my birth certificate.   _  that my parents were still in the district, they started to ring around. The suitcase was   _   returned to us.\n              This couple's   _   and persistence  in finding us is truly admirable.",
