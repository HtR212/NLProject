I will stand in line for 40minutes just to get on a ride that lasts 30 seconds. Each step that I take brings me closer and closer to my   _   of going on a ride of a lifetime. The   _   has me skipping around like a 4 year old.\nBut during my first ride there, that kind of thrill turned to absolute   _   when I made it to the front.   _   waiting in line I was now having a second thought. Quietly, I negotiated within myself about my courage to go through with this   _  .\nFrom far away it looked   _   but when I was about to get in the driver's seat I   _   I forgot my license. After some self motivation I finally made the move to   _   my seat.\nOn my way up I could clearly see the ups and downs   _   me. To me they were not only the route but also   _   challenges. Soon the track was full of such   _  tunnels that I could see only what was behind me but not in front.\n  _   there were people around me with both of their hands in the   _   while I, knowing that things were going to get   _   grasped the handle on my seat. I wouldn't dare celebrate something that   _   me.\nJust like roller coasters,   _   is full of ups and downs, darkness and light, and is unpredictable when we go through various   _   situations. The best thing to do when we meet anything   _   is to lift our hands and   _   whatever we do.",
