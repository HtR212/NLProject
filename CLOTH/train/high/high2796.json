    "article": "It was a stormy Saturday afternoon when my mother took my five-year-old brother, Christopher, and me to a new toy store.\n\"Christina! I'm going to find the Lego section!\" Christopher ran off excitedly.\nI was studying a Barbie when I suddenly heard  _  from the storm outside.I jumped  _  the noise, dropping the toy to the floor.Thunder continued to shake the sky.Oh no! Where's Christopher? I  _  up and down the aisles ,  _  filling my small chest and making it difficult to  _  .I continued to run, calling Christopher's name.I  _  to know he was all right.I found Christopher in the Lego aisle.He was standing alone, perfectly  _  , holding tightly to a toy ship.I threw my arms around him and hugged him  _  he couldn't breathe.\nYears later, on a Tuesday morning, when I was driving to work, the radio  _  my ears with horrible news: A plane had crashed into the Pentagon .My first  _  was of Christopher.\nHe had joined the Air Force and was in Washington.I was overcome with the need to make  _  he was all right.I  _  over to the nearest pay phone and dialed my grandmother's number.Christopher would call her to let the family know what was happening.I felt the  _  panic steal my breath as I waited for a connection.Finally, I heard my grandmother's voice.\n\"He's Okay.He called and told us he was fine.\" As I hung up the phone, I began to cry from  _  .It was silly of me to  _  about Christopher.I blamed myself.He was an adult and could take care of himself.  _  I realized at that moment that there is still a  _  of my heart that will always run to try to  _  him, no matter how big he might be or where he is.That same piece will  _  remember the five-year-old boy standing in the toy store with the toy ship held to his chest, saying, \"I  _  if I just waited here, Christina, you would find me.\"",
