    "article": "When I was a teenager, I volunteered to give out water at a marathon. Watching the different runners who passed by and grabbed a cup was  _  . The next year I signed up for the race. I did little preparation and my only goal was to finish. On the day of the race, it was  _  hot. I remember struggling at about the 5 mile, thinking, \"I am never doing this again!\" Have you ever felt that way about something? You eagerly choose a goal  _  soon realize it is  _  to achieve than you imagined it would be. That first 10 km race was quite an experience. I jogged, I walked, I jogged and I walked. Then  _  a decisive moment. Near the end, a 70-year-old man ran past me. I felt  _  that I was younger than him but I couldn't keep up with him. I felt defeated for a second but then I realized  _  . He was running his race and I was running mine. He had different experience, training and goals and I had mine.  How often  in life do we  _  ourselves with others and feel disappointed in ourselves when we really shouldn't? I decided, then, that one day I would be one of those 70-year-olds who were still running.  _  I crossed the finish line, I was proud of my achievement. Since then I have run several races and run purely for fun. In life we all  _  compare ourselves with others, which is only natural. But don't let them weaken you.  _  , you should use them to inspire you and show you what is possible. Then you are a true winner.",
