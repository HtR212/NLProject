    "article": "That was when my son was 6 years old. My son is now 22 but whenever I look at him even as a grown man, I remember the small child with   _   .\nOur cat was   _  to give birth. And like all young children, my son was very interested in the birth of the babies. During the following week, he never stopped  _  me for a chance to witness it. At last, I agreed. I answered all his questions and prepared him the best  so that  he might not be shocked or frightened.\nThat   _  when my son arrived home, one baby cat had been born. He was so   _  at what he saw that he would put his hand on the mother cat's stomach and feel the other babies   _  . When the mother cat began to   _  very loudly, it was clear that the second baby was on its way. My son  _   but never said a word. Then he asked me, \"Mum, why does she cry so loudly when the baby comes\" I   _  that it was not a hurtful pain but a pain of great pleasure   _  the mother. \nWhen the  _  of the third baby was coming by the crying of the mother cat, my son  _  hugged me with tears  rolling down  his face, saying, \"Mum, I'm sorry for the   _  I brought you to have me.\" My heart almost stopped. With a(n)   _  choice of words, I told him that his birth had brought me   _  but smiles, and that I would like to  go through  it 100 times. \nNow my son is a grown man, but he always   _  that night, for it was on that night that he finally   _  what the word \"love\" meant.",
