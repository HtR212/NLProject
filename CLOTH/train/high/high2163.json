When Karl's wife died a couple of years ago, he told the Social Security Administration to stop   _   monthly checks to his wife. But the agency   _   to send the checks. Karl called again; a clerk said not to   _  . He told Karl to mail a follow-up  _    that included his wife's   _    of death. But the checks continued to come. Karl needed the money,    _    he cashed his wife's checks.\nWhen SSA    _    realized its mistake, it sent Karl a letter saying that he    _    SSA $5,900 plus interest. Karl receives only $12,000 a year, which is slightly    _   poverty level. The only    _    that he ever had--$5,000--was    _    on his wife's funeral. He fought on Iwo Jima, site of one of the most furious battles of World War II. The battle left him 52 _  in one ear and almost blind in one eye.\nHis small house used to be in a good neighborhood. He takes the bus once a week to visit his wife's   _   . The rest of his time is spent at home, where he carves    _    military figures that he donates to a local charity. The charity    _   the carvings and uses the money to help feed the homeless.\nSSA gave Karl six months to pay the debt in    _   . Otherwise, the SSA letter said, the agency would seize his home. Karl wrote back, asking if it would be okay to   _    $30 a month. That was all he could    _   .\n\"That's insufficient,\" said William Shatner, an SSA agent. \"We know that he is a war veteran, but that doesn't entitle him to   _  the debt . He knew that his wife was dead, yet he cashed her monthly    _   . That is fraud, pure and simple.\"",
