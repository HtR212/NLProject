I went to work, drove and lived on my own. I climbed stairs and  got on  buses by myself. However, one year ago, someone came into my life and showed me that there were more  _  to face. His name is Joseph and he is my  _  . He doesn't  _  that I was born without legs. Instead, he does want me to feed him, carry him and comfort him.\nAnyone who has had a baby may know how much equipment it needs to take care of the baby. It turns out that being a parent without  _  needs more equipment, At least, I need to equip my wheelchair  _  a basket. When I put my baby in the basket, I can push him from room to room. It is a highly effective and cheap way and Joseph finds it fun.\n  _  , I try taking Joseph outside by using a baby belt and strapping  him on my chest, but Joseph often blocks my  _  , which makes it very difficult to go on.  _  I manage to do it, it is more by  _  than judgment. When a baby  _  , often the most effective way is to comfort it by walking around with it. However, I can't do that  _  , because it takes too long for me to get to Joseph in my wheelchair. Sometimes, when I only stand upright on my hands, Joseph holds out his arms for a  _  . He doesn't understand that if there's nothing for me to  _  myself, I can't safely hold him. His trust that I can  _  look after him gives me more courage.\nI have just  _  his first birthday. I'm very  _  for him to grow up and start walking, so that we can go outside together more easily. Let the challenges keep  _  . We'll be  _  and fine.",
