Holidays are  _  when you can't be with family, and I was mourning  the  _  of my dad and feeling sad about being  _  from my family in Indiana. But, that sadness turned into  _  when it hit me: I was going to have to prepare a traditional Thanksgiving  _  myself!\nThat night at Dubya's Restaurant, which was our favorite place to  _  , I began discussing the dilemma  with Jeff.\"It's too bad that this place won't be  _  on Thanksgiving, or we could just come here,\"I said.\nDubya, the owner of the restaurant, happened to be  _  by our table when I said those words.\"You mean you expect me to  _  for you on Thanksgiving, too?\"he teased  \" Well, I guess you'll just have to come to our  _  since the restaurant will be closed then.\".\nWe'd become  _  with Dubya and his wife, as we ate at Dubya's twice a week; however, I didn't think we were close enough to  _  Thanksgiving dinner with his family. I was sure he was  _  . But as we headed toward the door, Dubya handed Jeff a note with directions to their house and their phone number. \"You're  _  ?\" I asked \"Of course,\" he said.\nAnd, two days later, we reached Dubya's house. Everyone  _  us. As expected, the food was marvelous but the company was even better. We truly felt that we  _  there.\nOf course, I wrote them a thank-you note the next week, but I couldn't really  _  into words what that Thanksgiving dinner  _  had meant to us. I've never forgotten their kindness and that very  _  Thanksgiving.\nSo, here's my suggestion to you this year. If you know someone who will be dining alone on Thanksgiving, why not invite that person over to  _  your family?",
