And then I  _  myself that the only people I am  aware of   who don't have  _  are gathered in peaceful neighborhoods. There is never a  _  , never a moment of stress to ruin a day. All is calm. Most  _  have at least one such worry-free zone. We call them cemeteries  . \nBut if you're still  _  , you have difficulties. It's the way of life. And believe it or not, most of your problems may actually be  _  for you than you think. Let me explain. \nMaybe you have seen the Great Barrier Reef,   _  some 1, 800 miles from New Guinea to Australia. Tour guides regularly take visitors to  _  the reef. On one tour, the guide was asked a question. \"I notice that the lagoon  side of the reef looks  _  and lifeless, while the ocean side is lively and colorful, \"a traveler observed. \"  _  is this?\"\nThe guide gave an interesting answer, \"The coral  around the lagoon side is in  _  water, with no challenge for its survival. It  _  early. The coral on the ocean side is constantly being  _  by wind, waves, storms--surges of power. It has to fight for  _  every day of its life. As it is challenged and tested it changes and  _  . It grows healthy. It grows strong. And it reproduces.\"Then he added this telling note, \"That's the way it is  _  every living organism.\"\nLike coral  _  by the sea, we grow.   _  demands can cause us to grow stronger. Mental and emotional stress can produce strength and determination. Spiritual testing can produce   _  of character and faithfulness.",
