    "article": ",,21-40(A, B, CD),,. Ks5u\n \nOne fine afternoon I was walking along Fifth Avenue,   _   I remembered that it was necessary to buy a pair of socks. Why I wished to buy only one pair is    _  . I turned into the first sock shop that    _   my eye, and a boy clerk who could not have been more than seventeen years old    came forward  . \"What can I do for you, sir?\" \"I wish to buy a pair of socks.\" His eyes were shining. There was a note of  25 _  in his voice. \"Did you know that you had come into the finest place in the world to buy socks?\" I had not been aware of that, as I entered the shop   by accident  . \"Come with me,\" said the boy, excitedly. I followed him to the back part of the shop, and he began to take down from the shelves box after box,   _   their contents for my enjoyment. \"Hold on, young man, I am going to buy only one pair!\" \"I know that,\" said he, \"but I want you to see   _   beautiful these are. Aren't they wonderful?\"  _   was on his face an expression of pleasure,   as if   he were uncovering the mysteries of his religion. I became far   _   interested in him than in the socks. I looked at him in amazement. \"My friend,\" said I, \"if you can keep this up, if this is not   _   the enthusiasm that comes from having a new job, if you can keep up this enthusiasm and excitement day after day, in ten years you will own every 33 _  in the United States.\" \nMy amazement   _   his pride and joy in salesmanship will be easily understood by all who read this article. In many shops the    _   has to wait for someone to serve him. And when   _   some clerk does notice you, you are made to feel as if you were interrupting him. Either he is 37 _  in deep thought in which he hates to be disturbed or he is chatting with a girl clerk and you feel like   _   for \"being too rude\". \nHe shows no interest either in you or in the goods he   is paid   to sell. Yet possibly the very clerk who is now so indifferent  began his career with hope and   _  . The daily work was too much for him; the newness disappears slowly; his only pleasures were found outside of working hours; and he saw younger clerks who had more enthusiasm in their work promoted over him. He became sour. That was the last stage. His usefulness was over.",
