I wasn't the jelly maker in this  _  .My motherinlaw was.The only contribution I made to the jelly making was to  _  baby food jars,which my motherinlaw would  _  with the tasty gel and send back home with us.For the past 22 years,  _  I wanted to make a jelly sandwich,all I had to do was  reach for  one of those little jars of jelly.Jelly making was just a way of life for my motherinlaw.She always followed the same  _  --from picking the fruit to setting the  _  jelly on the homemade shelves. My motherinlaw passed away last December.Among the things in the house to be  _  by her children were the  _  canned goods.Each of her children chose from the many jars of tomato juice,green beans and jelly.When my husband  _  his jars home,we carefully put them away in our kitchen. The other day I reached the kitchen for some jelly,and there it was.Sitting all  _  on the far side of the shelf was a small jar.The lid was rusty.As I picked up the jar,I suddenly realized something that I had  _  to see earlier.Yes,this was the  _  jar we would ever have from the patient,  _  hands of my motherinlaw.It seemed like such a  _  thing,and most days it was something that was taken for granted.But today it seemed a valuable  _  .I put the jelly back on the shelf. We have many things that  _  belonged to my motherinlaw.These are the kinds of things that we expect to pass on to our children.But I'm just not  _  to give up this last jelly jar,and all the  _  its presence allows me to hold onto.The jar of jelly won't keep that  _  .It will either have to be eaten or thrown out...but not today.",
