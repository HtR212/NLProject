    "article": "It was mid-summer and my father had taken me to Boston to see the ducklings (little young ducks) in the public gardens. We had  _  most of the day just playing on the duck sculptures, running around, anything an eight-year-old  _  enjoy doing. More than anything I wanted to go on the swan boat in the pond,  _  the little ducklings were led to by their mother. The line was long, and it was a little shorter after noon. I was hungry and hot and was starting to get a little tired. The  _  was coming back and the line finally started to move  _  . I excitedly looked around, silently  _  to all around me, \"I'm going to  _  the swan boat!\" I saw  _  my left, on the other side of the chain linked barrier, a mother pushing her  _  in a carriage. The baby had  _  his bottle out of the carriage, and started to cry. The line kept moving to board the boat which had  _  at the dock, and there was just enough  _  for my dad and me to board. At that moment I ducked (moved like a duck)  _  the chain, picked up the bottle and ran with it to the mother. At this point, my father had  _  out of line to see where I was  _  to. The mother  _  me, and I walked back to my dad. He saw what I did and gave me a hug, then regretfully said that we had  _  the boat and it would be a long  _  for the next one. I looked at the boats, then the line, and finally at my dad with a big  _  and suggested we get ice cream instead. I learned that day that nothing feels better than doing something good for someone else. No matter how small or  _  it may be.",
