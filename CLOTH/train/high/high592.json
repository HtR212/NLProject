    "article": "_  not be the wisest person on this planet. but I will tell you a little  _  to happiness: Help others and live life. It is that simple. Just help a friend study for a test, or  _  at a nursing home . I learned this after a long, hard search.\nI was feeling really  _  because my friend had died. Then I started a six week work at a nursing home all day every Saturday for free. My routine was to  _  the meal and clean up. After that, I  _  wait for the head nurse to tell me what to do.\nOne day I was told to go to Room 117 to make sure the patient was all right. In the room I found a boy of eight  _  in his bed watching a movie. I was  _  to see a child in this seemingly forgotten nursing home  _  for the aged. He was so small and weak that you had to look closely to find him. He motioned for me to sit down. I grabbed his medical chart from which later I found out he had a terminal illness.\nWe started to talk, and I found out that his family  _  visited, and all he did every day was watch TV. I wanted to cry for him, and for my lost friend. As we talked, he had a smile on his face, and I asked him why.\n\"The entire two hours I've been here you've never lost that smile.  _  this horrible disease, how do you still  _  to stay happy?\"\nHe thought for a while, and then said that too many people are dead even before they stop  _  .They walk around feeling that God has cursed   them and that they have  _  to live for.\nThe boy said that he would not be like that. He wakes every morning  _  to see another sunrise. He keeps his window open so that he can  _  the flowers and feelthe heat of the sun. He also said that he has hope.\n\"Too many people haven't seen much of  _  is around here,\" he said,\" Life is full of hope and we need to live life  _  it is gone. \"\nI don't know what happened to him. I assume he  passed away  , but his lesson lives on. I now wake up and live each day to the  _  . The key to life is not money or fame, but the lessons we learn from it.",
