First, she took\nsome mud   and   _  a round cake with it.\n\"Oh, that's how it's done!\" said the thrush , and it   _  away. Then the magpie\ntook some twigs   and put them round in the   _  .\nThe blackbird  said, \"Now I   _  all about it!\"\nand flew off. Later the magpie put another layer   of mud over the twigs. \"That's quite obvious!\" the owl  said and flew away.   _  this, the magpie took some twigs and\nput them round the outside. \"The very thing!\" said the sparrow and it went off too. Then the magpie took some features   and covered the inside of the nest very   _  with them. \"That\nsuits me!\" cried the starling , and off  it flew.\nSo it   went on  ,\nevery bird taking away some  _  of how to build nests, but none of them\nwaiting to the  _  .\nThe magpie went on working without noticing until the only bird that   _  was the\nturtledove . He hadn't paid any   _  all along, but only kept on saying\nits silly cry, \"Take two, take two-o-o-o!\" The magpie said, \"One is  _  .\"\nBut the turtledove kept on saying, \"Take two, take two-o-o-o!\" The magpie got  _  and said, \"You just need one, I tell you!\" Still the turtledove cried, \"Take\ntwo, take two-o-o-o!\"\nAt last, the magpie   _  up but she saw  _  near her except the silly turtledove,\nand then she flew away and  _  to tell the birds how to build nests again.\nThat is why different birds build their nests   _  .",
