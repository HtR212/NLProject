    "article": "Once upon a time, two brothers, who lived on neighboring farms, fell into conflict. It was the first serious 31 _  in their 40 years' brotherhood. Then one day the long tie   fell apart  . It resulted from a small misunderstanding, and then grew into a major difference, and eventually exploded into an exchange of   _   words followed by weeks of silence. \nVery early one morning there was a(n)    _   on the elder brother's door. He opened it to find a man with a carpenter's toolbox. \"I'm   _   for a few days' work,\" he said. \"Perhaps you would have a few small jobs here and there. Could I help you?\"\n \"Well as it happens there is,\" said the elder brother,  _   across the creek   to his brother's farm. \"My younger brother lives there. A conflict broke out between us and he used his bulldozer   to dig the creek to   _   me and thus a gap   _   between us. And I'll do something to    _    him back. See that pile of wood over there? I want you to build me a 3-metre-high fence, so I won't need to see him or his place anymore.\"\nThe carpenter said, \"I think I understand the   _  . Show me the nails and the digger and I'll be able to do a job that   _   you.\"\nThe elder brother had to go to town for supplies, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was   _   for the day. About sunset   _   the elder brother returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. Much to the elder brother's shock: there was no   _   there at all; instead there was a bridge,  _   from one side of the creek to the other. And his younger brother was coming across the bridge.\n\"You are quite a fellow to build this bridge   regardless of   all I've said and done,\" he said.\nThe two brothers then met in the middle of the bridge, taking each other's hand and   _  . They then turned to see the carpenter   _   his toolbox on his shoulder.\n\"No, wait, please 49 _  a few days. I've a lot of other projects for you,\" said the older brother.\n\"I'd love to stay on,\" the carpenter said, \"but I have many more   _   to build.\"",
