    "article": "When I was a boy I was always amazed by what a heavy sleeper my Grandma was. I knew this mainly because her  _  was right next to the one my brother and I  _  .When I would wake up in the morning I would hear her steady snoring echoing through the  _  walls.She rarely ever got up during the  _  and when she took a short sleep in her chair the television and record player never  _  her up. It seemed a strange  _  then that during the middle of one night she would  _  awake the moment that old wiring in her room caught fire.Her  _  awoke my brother who then rushed through the house waking up the rest of the family.The  _  was made of old,  _  timbers and the fire raced through it in a  _  of minutes.Smoke filled every room.None of us could see anything.We were all filled with  _  and confusion .Still,  thanks to  my Grandma waking up at just that moment we all  _  it out safely.My Mom even found our small dog and picked him up just  _  we ran out the front door. Without the coincidence of my Grandma waking up at just the  _  second that fire would have  _  us our lives as well as our home.Without it my brother would never have become a teacher and I would never have  _  a word. Without it my brothers and I would never have raised seven  _  children. Without it all the love,learning, and  _  my family has shared with others would have been lost.",
