    "article": "No one would be willing to pay one-third of the price for the packaging or wrapping of what he or she purchases. But over-packaging has become a disease that leads to an  _  waste of resources and  contributes to  environmental pollution. The wasted packaging materials are  _  to be worth about 280 billion yuan annually. And such packages and wrappings thrown away by customers  _  up half of the volume of solid waste in cities.  _  , it is high time that regulations were  _  to stop enterprises from spending too much on unnecessary packaging and wrapping. To produce paper packaging or wrapping, many more trees have to be cut down. Over-packaging also limits the interest of consumers when they have to spend quite a high percentage on something that they will have to throw into the dustbin. The simple truth is that the more a producer spends on packaging, the  more expensive  the products it sells will be. Product packaging and wrapping used to be very simple 30 years ago. \"Shabby\" was the word many had used to  _  the way Chinese products were packaged. And shabby packaging was blamed for making Chinese products  _  in the international market. It is  _  to pay enough attention to packaging or wrapping products in such a manner that they can be  _  to customers' eyes. But that does not definitely justify that packaging should even outshine what is inside. In the Chinese proverb, \"maidu huanzhu,\" the buyer returns the pearl and just keeps the case because the  _  is too fancy and luxurious. It not only laughs at the poor  _  of the buyer, but also criticizes the unnecessary  _  the seller has made in making the case. Another message from the proverb is that over-packaging helps cultivate an  _  consuming attitude - to buy fancy-looking stuff but not what they really need.",
