    "article": "When the weather turns warm, everyone wants to be in or around the water. Hanging out at the pool the beach on a hot day is a great way to beat the heat. Most people don't think much about water  _  -but they should. For people between the ages of 5 and 24, drowning is the second  _  cause of accidental death. It doesn't have to be that way,  _  .By knowing how to stay safe and following a few simple guidelines, most water related accidents can be  _  . It's a good idea to swim only in places that are watched over by a lifeguard.  Nobody  can predict changing ocean currents, sudden storms, or other  _  dangers. In the event that something does go wrong, lifeguards are trained in  _  techniques. Swimming in an  _  body of water(like a river, lake, or ocean) is different from swimming in a pool. You need more  _  to handle the currents and other changing conditions in the open water. If you do find yourself  _  in a current, don't panic and don't fight the current. Try to swim parallel to the shore until you are able to  get out of  the current, which is usually a narrow channel of water.  _  try to make your way back to shore as you do so. If you're  _  to swim away from the current, stay calm and  _  with the current. The current will usually  slow down  ,then you can swim to shore.  _  a very good swimmer who tries to swim against a strong current will get worn out. If you're going to  _  in open water, better take lessons that provide you with tips on  _  unexpected dangers. Some areas with extremely strong currents are  _  limits when it comes to swimming. Do your research so you know  _  not to swim, and pay attention to any warning signs posted in the area.",
