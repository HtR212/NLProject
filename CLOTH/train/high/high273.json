I can still remember one afternoon  _  I was eight years old. I'd wanted more than anything to be  _  to climb the walls surrounding the farm. The walls were old;some stones were  _  , others loose. Still, my yearning to climb across those walls  _  so strong that finally, one spring afternoon, I took all my  _  and entered the living room, where the  _  had gathered after Sunday dinner. \"I, I want to climb the stone walls,\" I said.  _  a chorus went up from the women in the room.\"Heavens, no!\" they cried,\"You'll hurt yourself!\"I wasn't too  _  ;the  _  was just as I'd expected. Just  before  I could leave the room, I was stopped by my grandfather's loud voice.\"Now wait a minute.\" I heard him say,\"Let the boy climb the stone walls. He has to learn to do things  by himself  \" For the next two hours I climbed those old walls and had the time of my life. Later I told my grandfather about my  _  .I'll never forget what he said. \"Fred,\"he said, smiling, \"you made this day a (an)  _  day just by being yourself. Always remember, there's only one person in this whole world like you, and I like you  _  as you are.\" Many years have passed  _  then, and today I'm a host in the television program  named  \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\", seen by millions of children. There have been  _  over the years, but one thing  _  the same:my suggestion left to children at the end of almost every program. \"There's only one person in this whole world like you,\" The kids can hear me say, \"and people would like you exactly as you are.\"",
