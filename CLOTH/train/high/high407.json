    "article": "Having been a music teacher for twenty-seven years, I have always known that music touches the spirit. It can  break through  all kinds of barriers to reach the students in a very special way. It can be the  _  by which each child can find their light. I'd like to share a story where music overcame a  _  barrier and made a connection with a young student. One of my most  _  students was a young girl called Vanessa. Vanessa had difficulty walking and couldn't speak at that time. We  _  sat on the floor for our music lessons. We all like a song, which was a call and response song where I sang the call and the students clapped twice while singing the repeat, \"Oh, yes!\" We probably  _  that song during every class, Vanessa and I clapping together. She never said or sang a word. One day late in the school year, when the song was finished, Vanessa turned around, looked at me directly in the eye, clapped her tiny hands twice and  _  the words \"Oh, yes!\" I opened my mouth  in surprise  and for that moment I was the one who couldn't speak . Through music, we had made an excellent  _  . Several years later, I met Vanessa in the street in town. She waved to me with a big smile on her face and then clapped her hands twice, copying the song we had performed so many times. This precious little girl,  _  her connection with music, left a(n)  _  on me that will last forever. Every child has the ability to learn and grow. It is up to us as  _  to discover the way to reach each and every one of our students. We all must find each child's light.",
