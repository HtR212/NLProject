Such children are known  _  home-schoolers\". Some parents prefer teaching their children at home  _  they do not believe schools teach the correct religious  _  ; others believe they can provide a better educational  _  for their children by doing so.  _  results show home-schooled children often do better than  _  on national tests in reading and math. David teaches his three children at home. He  _  that his children learn very differently from children in school. Learning starts with the children's  _  and questions. For example, when there is snowfall on a winter day, it may  _  a discussion about climate, snow removal  _  , Alaska, etc. Or a spring evening when the family is out  _  the stars is a good time to ask questions about the sky. If the Brazilian rain forests are on TV, it  _  be a perfect time to talk about how rain forests influence the climate, how deserts are  _  and how the polar ice caps  _  ocean levels. Home schooling is often more interesting than  _  schools, but critics say home-schoolers might be uncomfortable  _  with other people in adult life. Critics also say that most parents are not  _  to teach their children. However, most parents don't have the time or the  _  to teach their children at home, so schools will continue to be  _  most children get their formal education.",
