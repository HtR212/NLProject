She has no family near her so if she  _  her phone, her children or their school will have no way to get in  _  with her. After reading her plea , I thought about it all night and it broke my heart. This morning I  _  her that I wanted to help. And I  _  her phone bill so that she would not lose it. She wrote me one of the most  _  letters I have ever received,  _  me how thankful she was. She  _  and said that I would never know how  _  it meant to her that a stranger would be so  _  . She had nowhere to go and didn't know where to turn. I  _  to her that she was a kind heart and it is especially important to me to help  _  people such as her. I am very glad to have been able to help  _  .
