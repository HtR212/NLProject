One morning, when the boy was around two years old, the husband saw a  _  bottle open. He was  _  for work, so he  _  the wife to cap the bottle and put it in the cupboard. The mother,  _  in the kitchen, totally  _  the matter. The boy saw the bottle and  _  went to it and, fascinated with its color, drank it all. It  _  to be a poisonous medicine meant  _  adults in small dosages. When the child fell down, the mother  _  hurried him to the hospital, where he died. The mother was shocked; she was  _  . How would she  _  her husband? When the  _  father came to the hospital and saw the dead child, he looked at his wife and uttered just four words. What do you think those four words were? The husband just said, \"I  _  You Darling\", which is totally  _  . Yet, the father did the very right thing. The child is dead. He can never be brought back to life. There is no  _  in finding fault with the mother.  _  , if only he had taken time to put the bottle away, this would not have happened. No point in attaching  _  . She had also lost her only child. What she  _  at that moment was comfort and sympathy from the husband. That is what he  _  her. Sometimes we spend time asking who is responsible or who's to blame, whether in a relationship, in a job or with the people we know and miss out on the  _  in human relationships we could receive by giving each other support.",
