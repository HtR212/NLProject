    "article": "My daughter and I finally got around to changing all the electronic pictures stored on our computers and cellphones into  _  ones that we could actually hold in our hands and  put into  photo albums. It was amazing looking through decades of our lives.\nThere I was not even 5 years old. I looked at that boy and all those  _  versions of myself for a long time. I wondered what I would say to them  _  I had a chance. I knew that I would tell them to relax and not worry about life's  _  so much. I would tell them that they would solve all the problems they could and  get through  the ones they couldn't. I would tell them to enjoy and  _  each day as it comes. I would tell them that every day has its own  _  and simple pleasures and they should  _  them all. I would tell them to hug more, laugh more, and say \"I love you\" more. I would  _  them to take in more sunsets and to  turn off  the television every so often and go watch the stars. I would tell them to sing along with the radio and read a good book every  _  they get. I would tell them to  _  pass up the opportunity to pet a dog or  _  another human being. Most of all,  _  ,I would tell them to just love,  because  that's what we are here to do.\n  Of course  , I know that none of us can go backward in this life. Life can only go  _  . As you go forward in your own life, always take with you the wisdom you have  _  , the kindness you have shared, and the  _  you have received. As you go forward, always try to be the best person you can be and always remember to just love and be loved in return.",
