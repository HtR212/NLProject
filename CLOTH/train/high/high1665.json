    "article": "Like that of her own character, Harry Potter, J. K. Rowling's life is like a fairy tale. Divorced, living on public assistance in a tiny Edinburgh flat with her infant daughter, Rowling   _   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone  _   a table in a cafe during her daughter's naps--and it was Harry Potter   _   rescued her.\nRowling   _   that she always wanted to write and that the first   _   she actually wrote down, when she was five or six, was a story about a rabbit   called   Rabbit. Many of her favorite memories   _   around reading--hearing The Wind in the Willows   _   aloud by her father when she had the measles , enjoying the fantastic adventure stories of E. Nesbit, reveling  in the magical world of C. S. Lewis's Narnia, and her favorite story of all, The little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge.\nAt Exeter University Rowling took her degree in French and   _   one year studying in Paris. After college she moved to London to   _   as a researcher and bilingual secretary. The best thing about working in an office, she has said, was   _   up stories on the computer when no one was   _  . During this time, on a particularly long train ride from Manchester to London in the summer of 1990, the idea   came to   her of a boy who is a wizard and doesn't know it. He   attends   a school for wizardry--she could see him very plainly in her mind. By the time the train   _   into Kings Cross station four hours later, many of the characters and the early stages of the plot were fully   _   in her head. The story took further shape as she continued working on it in   _   and cafes over her lunch hours.\nAfter her marriage to a Portuguese TV journalist ended in divorce, Rowling returned to Britain with her infant daughter and suitcase full of Harry Potter notes and   _  . She settled in Edinburgh to be near her sister and   set out   to finish the book before looking for a teaching job. Wheeling her daughter's carriage around the city to escape their   _  , cold apartment, she would duck into coffee shops to write when the baby fell asleep. In this way she finished the book and started sending it to publishers.",
