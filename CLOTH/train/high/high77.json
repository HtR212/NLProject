Most students are  _  being told by their parents to study harder so that they can have a\nbright life. Though that may be a good idea for clever students,  _  it may become heavy pressure for students who have difficulties in\ntheir studies.\nSome students join the groups of trouble-makers. Many of them have worked very hard at school but they have   _  in\nthe exams, and it makes their parents disappointed. Such students feel that\nthey're  _  by everyone else and they don't want\nto study at school any longer.\nMost parents are worried about their children, but they don't help them in any way. They think that they aren't able to help their children and that it's the   _  work to help them.\nTo make matters  _  , a lot of parents send their\nchildren to evening schools or weekend schools. Those schools only help\nstudents to pass exams.\nMany schools usually have rules about   _  , from the students' hair to their clothes and the things in their\nschoolbags.  In fact  , such strict rules may hurt the\nfeelings of the students.\nAlmost 40% of the students said that no one had taught them how to get on with others, how to   _  right from wrong,\nhow to show love to others, even to their parents.",
