    "article": "The amount of usable water has always been of great interest in the world.  _  springs and streams sometimes means control , particularly in the  _  areas like the desert . The control is possible even without possession of large areas of  _  land. In the early days of the American West , gun fights were not  _  for the water resources . And laws had to be  _  to protect the water rights of the  _  and the use of the water resources accordingly.  _  is known to us all, there is not  _  water in all places for everyone to use as much as he likes . Deciding on the  _  of water that will be used in any particular period  _  careful planning, so that people can manage and use water more  _  . Farmers have to change their use of or demand for water  according to  the water supply forecast . The  _  water supply forecast is based more on the water from the  _  than from the below. Interest is  _  in the ways to increase rainfall by man-made methods, and to get water from the winter snow on mountain  _  . With special equipment , some scientists are studying the ways in which the mountain snow can be  made use of  , and with the help of a repeater station , they send the  _  data to the base station . The operator at the base station can get the data at any time by  _  a button. In the near future, the forecast and use of water  _  probably depend on the advanced knowledge of snow on mountains, not of water underground.",
