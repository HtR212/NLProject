    "article": "I work at a company where there are lots of employees. I can't say I know them all  by name  ,but I know most of them. I think that almost  _  of them know me. It's all based on one  _  principle: I believe every single person  _  to be acknowledged , however small or simple the greeting.\nWhen I was about 10 years old, I was  _  down the street with my mother. She  _  to speak to Mr. Lee, while I was aiming at the \" O\" in the STOP  _  with a stone. I knew I could see Mr. Lee any time  _  the neighborhood, so I\ndidn't pay any  _  to him. After we passed Mr. Lee, my mother, stopped me and said something that has  _  with me from that day until now. She said, \"You let that be the  _  time you ever walk by somebody and not open up your mouth to  _  because even a dog can wag  its  _  when it passes you on the street.\"  That phrase  _  simple, but it's been a guidepost for me. And it feels  _  that when I speak to someone, they speak back.\nI've become vice president  _  that hasn't changed the way I approach people. I still follow my mother's  _  .I speak to everyone I see, no matter where I am. I've learned that speaking to people  _  a pathway into their world and it lets them come into mine, too.\nThe day you speak to someone who has their head  held down  and when they lift it up and  _  ,you realize how powerful it is just to open your mouth and say, \"Hello.\"",
