    "article": "Dear Dad, I was very upset when I received your letter. I knew you  _  not like my results, but I didn't realize you and Mum were so  _  with me. This has made me  _  very carefully about myself, and now I  _  how silly I have been. My poor  _  have come from my own  _  . Of course, I want to do my best. I want you and Mum to be proud  _  me, but somehow when I get to school I just can't keep my  _  on the subject and I stop  listening to  the teacher. So many other things seem so much more  _  , but I know that I must not  _  the chance you and Mum have given me. If I don't work very hard 5  _  he next few months, I am going to get  _  results. So I am going to study hard this summer. And I will show Mum anything  _  I can't understand so that she can give me help. I  _  you will allow me to play some basketball. I think I need some exercise,  _  I will control the time I  _  on it properly. If you want me to stop meeting Cindy, I will -- but there is  _  serious. We are just good friends, and she often helps me  _  my schoolwork. Dad, I am really sorry I have made you angry. I'm going to try my best to  _  my study. I promise that I will make you proud of me soon. Yours, Jimmy",
