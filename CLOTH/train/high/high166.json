I'd get up early and run to the tree to find a dozen   _  from Santa and then spend the rest of the morning playing with toys along with my three sisters. Before long,   _  , the truth about Santa came out. Santa was dad. And dad's salary as a   _   wasn't growing at the same rate as inflation  . So over the years, a dozen gifts for each child   _   became six, then four, then two.   _   I sat in the living room in late December, home for a few weeks between semesters of college, I had one present to open.\nThe Christmas ritual   in our family was to open gifts on Christmas Eve. We were sitting around in a circle and the unwrapping   _   continued. The ritual lasted about ten minutes. And then something   _   happened.\nMy mother said, \"There's one more gift I want to show you.\" And with her   _   , she disappeared to her bedroom. Minutes later, mom reappeared with an attractive red dress.\n\"It's   _  , mom,\" my older sister said, breaking the silence.\nThrough a voice choked with emotion and a smile that could   light up   the universe, mom said quietly, \"For the first time in 12 years, your father   _   a Christmas bonus   from school. And with the bonus, he bought this dress for me.\"\nAll eyes moved   _   dad. I'd only seen dad cry once. It was the day his father died. And now, with mom's announcement, he was on the point of bursting into   _   once again. Suddenly, the   _   of Christmas, which I had unfortunately   _   to gifts, returned on a wave of gratitude, flooding my heart like nothing I'd ever   _  . I was overwhelmed with appreciation for dad.\nI've heard it said that the   _   thing a father can do for his children is to always show   _   for their mother. Today, dad's   _   and generosity changed me.",
