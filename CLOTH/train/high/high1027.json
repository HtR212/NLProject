When Jennifer  _  me with a question on the second day, I was  _  for the chance to connect at least one name with a face.\nHer writing wasn't perfect,  _  her effort was. She worked hard and pushed herself to achieve. She was excited to  _  , which made me enjoy teaching her. I didn't  _  then how much she would also teach me. One Friday afternoon, Jennifer stopped by after class. She wasn't asking a question  _  a paper I'd returned.  _  , she said quietly: \"I didn't attend classes yesterday. I was at the health center the whole day.\" I gave her a sideways look,  _  . \"It was just a virus  . I'm fine now,\" she  _  me. Then she was gone.\nTwo nights later, her father called to tell me that Jennifer would be  _  a few classes. She had been in hospital with meningitis  . I heard from him again a few days later, and again after that. Her condition grew  _  . We made trips to the hospital room. I was  _  frightened when I saw the pale, thin and weak girl who, only ten days earlier, had displayed life and warmth in my classroom.\nA week later, Jennifer herself called me to tell me she was on the road to  _  . \"I'll be back to school one day,\" she said. \"I have no  _  that you'll be with us.\" I told her,  fighting back  tears. I remembered what her father had said in his first phone call: \"school  _  everything to Jenny.\"\nThen five weeks later, I walked into my classroom to find Jenny in her seat,   _  She  handed in  all of her missed homework, completed with thought and excellence. The strength of her will to overcome shone out of her pale, weak, eighteen-year-old face.",
