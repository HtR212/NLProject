It was my favorite activity\nbecause the streets were so  _  when it rained.  _  , I saw an old man with  _  clothes\npicking cans out of a rubbish bin. When I ran past him, I didn't know  _  I should give him my umbrella. As I was  _  ,\nI was still running. But I finally decided to give him my umbrella, as I knew\nhe needed the umbrella much more than I needed it,  _  I\nran back, gave him the umbrella and said, \"You need this more than I  _  .\" To my surprise, he took it  _  a big smile on\nhis face and repeated, \"Thank you! Thank you! God bless you.\" I hadn't expected\nhe would  _  it so much. I walked away feeling  _  . When I turned back, I  _  him still there,\nsmiling. \"It was just an umbrella,\" I thought, not  _  that\nit was the  _  that made him happy. He might feel\nthat he wasn't  _  in the world.\n    A few weeks later, when I was running on the same street on a bright sunny day, I  passed by  the\nsame man who was in the same clothes sitting down resting. The only  _  was my umbrella right beside him, looking like he  _  it.\nIt was very clean and neatly placed. At that moment, I realized it didn't  _  that I couldn't give him a house or a job. I only did what I\nwas able to and it made a whole lot of  _  seem to go\naway.",
