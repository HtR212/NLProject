    "article": "It was unusually quiet in the emergency room on December 25. I was triage nurse that day. I didn't  _  many patients, so I was not happy about having to  _  on Christmas. Just then, five bodies  showed up  at my desk: a pale woman and four small children. \"Are you all sick?\" I asked  _  .\"Yes,\" the woman said weakly. But when they got to describe their problems, things got a little  _  . Two of the children had headaches,  _  they weren't holding their heads like headache sufferers  _  do. Two children had earaches, but only one could tell me which ear was affected. The mother complained of a cough but seemed to work to  _  it.  _  was wrong, but I didn't say anything except that it might be a little while before a doctor saw her. She  _  , \"Take your time; it's  _  in here.\" Then I checked the chart after the admitting clerk had finished registering the family. No  _  -- they were homeless. The waiting room was warm. I looked out at the family huddled by the Christmas tree. The smallest one was pointing at the television and exclaiming something to her mother. The oldest one was looking at an ornament on the tree. I went back to the nurses' station and mentioned we had a  _  family in the waiting room. The nurses, irritated about having to work on Christmas, suddenly felt  _  for a family just trying to get warm on Christmas. The team went into  _  , much as we do when there's a medical emergency. Only this time it was a Christmas emergency. We were each entitled to a free meal in the hospital cafeteria on Christmas Day, so we  _  that meal and prepared a banquet for our Christmas guests. We needed presents. We put together oranges and apples in a basket. From various departments, we  _  candies, crayons and other suitable items. As seriously as we met the physical  _  of the patients that came to us that day, our team worked to meet the needs, and go beyond the  _  , of a family who just wanted to be warm on Christmas Day. Later, as the family walked to the door to  _  , the four-year-old came running back, gave me a hug and whispered, \"Thanks for being our angels today.\"",
