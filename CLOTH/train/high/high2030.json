Why is a fed bear a dead one? According to a friend, many travelers used to throw their food from their cars for the bears.  _  , the bears turned to the roadside for food and slowly lost their ability to take care of themselves. When winter came, fewer travelers took to the mountains, which  _  less food for the bears, some of whom starved or frozen to death. So the Canadian government  put up  warning signs along the road, essentially advising people not to feed the bears.\nThis reminded me of a scientific experiment. Some white mice were  _  into two groups. One group spent their days only eating and sleeping,  _  the other, fed only with half the amount of food  _  , had to search for food. Half a year later, scientists found that the mice that had to search for their own food were  _  , while the fully fed ones were either ill or dead. It was  _  that the underfed white mice, in the  _  of searching for their food, had kept healthy by exercising in finding food, being adaptable, and  _  their immunity .\nMany over-concerned parents are feeding their children like  _  or white mice. At present, children are only good at reading and studying, and are not encouraged to think independently and act for themselves.  _  placed in strange environments, they are lost, confused, and helpless. Parents do not understand what it takes to ensure their children's long-term success. They  _  the most important thing --- and that is how to cultivate their children into  _  adults, so that they can bravely undertake  challenges and succeed in the future.",
