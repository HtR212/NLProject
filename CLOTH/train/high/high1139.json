    "article": "The first attempt of even the most talented artists, musicians, and writers is seldom a masterpiece. If you consider your drafts as dress , or tryouts, revising will seem a natural part of the writing  _  . What is the purpose of the dress rehearsals and the out-of-town previews that many Broadway shows go through? The answer is adding, deleting, replacing, reordering,  in other words  revising. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Phantom of the Opera underwent such a process. When Lloyd Webber began writing in 1984, he had in mind a funny, exciting production. However, when Phantom opened in London in 1986, the audience saw a moving psychological love story set to music. The musical had  _  several revisions due to problems with . For instance, Lloyd Webber  _  some of the music because the Phantom's makeup prevented the actor from singing certain sounds. When you revise, you change aspects of your work in  _  to your evolving purpose, or to include  _  ideas or newly discovered information. Revision is not just an afterthought that gets only as much time as you have at the end of an assignment.  _  , it is a major stage of the writing process, and writers revise every step of the way. Even your decision to  _  topics while prewriting is a type of revising. However, don't make the mistake of skipping the revision stage that follows training. Always make time to become your own  _  and view your dress rehearsal, so to speak. Reviewing your work in this way can give you  _  new ideas. Revising involves  _  the effectiveness and appropriateness of all aspects of your writing, making your purpose more  _  , and refocusing or developing the facts and ideas you present. When you revise, ask yourself the following questions, keeping in mind the audience for whom you are writing: Is my main idea or purpose  _  throughout my draft? Do I ever lose sight of my purpose? Have I given my readers all of the  _  ; that is, facts, opinions, inferences --- that they need in order to understand my main idea? Finally, have I included too many  _  details that may confuse readers?",
