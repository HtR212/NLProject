    "article": "It was only a few weeks after my surgery. I went to Dr. Belt's office for a    _  . It was just after\nmy first chemotherapy treatment . My scar was still very tender.     As usual  . I was taken\nto an examination room to have my blood  _  , again--a\nterrifying process for me, since I'm so frightened of  _  .\nI lay down on the    examining bed  .\nThen Ramona entered the room. Her  _  smile was\nfamiliar, and  stood out  in contrast to my fears. I'd\nfirst seen her in the office a few weeks earlier. She wasn't my  _  on that day, but I remember her because she was laughing. What\ncould she  _  find to laugh about at a time like\nthis? So I decided she wasn't  _  enough about\nthe whole thing.\nBut this day was     _  . Ramona had taken my blood before. She  knew about  my\nfear of needles, and she kindly  _  the medical\nequipment under a magazine. As we opened the layers of bandage, the  _  scar on my chest could be seen.\nShe gently    _  over\nand ran her hand across the scar,  _  the\nsmoothness of the healing skin. I began to cry gently and quietly. She brought\nher warm eyes to mine and said, \"You haven't  _  it\nyet, have you?\" And I said, \"No.\"\nI continued to cry gently. In    _  tones she said. \"This is part of your body. This is you. It's\nokay to touch it.\" But I couldn't. So she touched it for me. The  _  . The healing wound. And beneath it, she touched my heart.\nThat night as I lay down, I gently placed my hand on my chest and I left it there    _  I\nfell asleep. I knew I wasn't alone.",
