I went right to a doctor and got an X-ray examination, which  _  a lot of damage to my knee -- a(n)  _  injury for a dancer. I had to have a(n)  _  .Everything had been going so well and now I had this huge injury. Dance was my life, but  all of a sudden  , I wasn't going to be able to do it for a year or  _  never again.

After the  _  , Eliot said, \"You know, you have a(n)  _  -- and you are also made of steel.\" That, coming from him, was the  _  compliment I have ever received. I'd like to think that  dealing with  my injury made me strong.",
