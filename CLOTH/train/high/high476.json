He\nwould  _  the salary, but he needed to retire. They could get\nby.\nThe employer was   _  to see his good worker go and\nasked if he could build just one  _  house as a personal  _  . The carpenter said yes,  _  over time it was easy to\nsee that his heart was not in his work. He used bad workmanship and inferior  materials. It was an unfortunate way to end his   _  .\nWhen the carpenter finished his work, the employer came to   _  the\nhouse and handed the front-door key to the carpenter. \"This is your house,\" he\nsaid, \"my  _  to you.\"The carpenter was shocked! What a   _  !If he had only known he was building his own house, he would have done it all so   _  .\nSo it is with us. We build our lives in a distracted    _  , willing to put up less than the\nbest. At  _  points we do not give the job our best  _  . Then with a shock we look at the situation we have  _  and\nfind that we are now living in the house we have built. \nBut, you cannot   go  back  . You are the carpenter, and every day you hammer a nail, place a board, or\nbuild a wall. The plate on the wall says, \"Life is a do-it-yourself project.\"\nYour life tomorrow will be the result of your  _  and the\nchoices you  _  today. Therefore, build  _  !",
