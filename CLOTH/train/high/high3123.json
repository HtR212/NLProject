Seeing the smoke coming out of a storm drain , Frank called the fire department immediately. \"The storm drain is  _  fire!\" he said. The fire department asked for his whereabouts and he said he was near the 6th and Main. They said they  _  be right there to investigate the situation. Frank needn't to go anywhere, so he waited for the  _  to arrive. He was curious what could be burning beneath the street. As far as he knew, there wasn't anything beneath the street  _  concrete . And everyone  _  that concrete doesn't burn. A fire truck arrived a few  _  later. \"Are you the man who  _  ?\" asked the driver. \"Yes. \" Frank answered. By now Frank could not only smell the  smoke  but also hear crackling sounds, just like wood burning. The firemen didn't seem to consider it an emergency. \"  _  do you think it could be?\" Frank asked the driver. \"Oh, we know what it is. We have to  _  a problem like this every few months. It's the homeless people in their \"  _  \". \" Homeless people have been living under the streets for years.  _  their knowledge of the storm drain system, they  set up  their own \"houses\" beneath the streets. These living areas have tables, mattresses, chairs, and sofas. The settlers often \"borrow\" electricity by connecting to a live wire above ground to  _  their own lights and even TVs underground. Either this  _  electricity or a cigarette can cause an occasional fire. Frank watched  _  some firemen lifted a manhole cover and went beneath the street with a fire hose . Then a few minutes later, the  _  smoke turned white. Shortly  _  , the firemen reappeared with a  _  person who seemed to have just been woken up.",
