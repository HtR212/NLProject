In 1991,I had spent five months in Viger ,a hot African country. There were many things I found  _  about this place--the climate and beggars who  _  shouted \"Cadeau! Cadeau!\" It means gift. One  _  was a lot worse.One day,a friend and I headed for neighboring Burkina Faso to work in a health clinic.However,a motorbike with two men  _  slowly.Without warning,one of the men  _  my backpack as the motorbike swept close by.The bag had my passport,money,an airline ticket and other things precious to me.I was in deep  _  .In the weeks that followed I looked at all  _  with suspicion. All I wanted was to leave this place.One day,I was stopped by an old woman \"Cadeau!\" she cried. I'd had enough! I was sick and tired of the country.I told her firmly,\"A thief stole all my money and now I can't get off your country.\" The beggar woman listened carefully and  _  my words. \"Then I will give you a cadeau,\" she announced.Kindly,she placed an old brown coin in my palm. I looked at it  in shock  .Living in poverty,she gave me something priceless! I saw then the  _  beauty of the people of Burkina Faso and  _  deeply the quiet dignity of the small coin;she turned my perceptions upside down.",
