    "article": "There was once a young man walking down the streets of Rome, from one end of the city to the other, on his way to visit a relative. While walking, he happened to  _  a beautifully impressive church and heard  _  sounds coming from the building. They sounded like a lot of pounding .\nDeciding to satisfy his  _  , he approached the building, opened the heavy door and looked inside the church. Well , all he could  _  was an old man in front of a big piece of marble ,  _  the marble with a chisel  and hammer.\n\"Well , it must be something very  _  ,\" the young man probably thought to himself, \"  _  he doesn't even notice me.\" He then left the church and continued with his  _  .\nSeveral days later, he returned on the same  _  . It seemed that the old man was still going at it, so he decided to ask him what he was  _  doing.\nHe again went to the door, opened it and looked inside. To his  _  , there was a big statue of an angel  _  with wings spreading out wide open, light  _  on it through the stained glass windows, and it  _  the front of the church.\nHe could not help it but the next moment he was right next to the old man,  _  his jaw hanging wide open. He  _  with absolute amazement and a puzzled look on his face.  He just could not understand how the old man knew that there was an angel in that piece of  _  and he could not help but  _  him, \"Sir , how did you know that there was an  _  in that piece of marble?\"\nThe old man  turned around  and replied, \"Son, there is an angel in every one of us. All we need to do is to take a hammer and a chisel and chip away at all those little piece that do not look like an angel.\"",
