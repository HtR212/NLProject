    "article": "I used to be ashamed of my grandma. I know that's a  _  thing to say, but it was true until today, so I have to  _  it. The  _  started when my friend Katy found Grandma's false teeth floating in a glass on the bathroom sink. I was so used to seeing them that I  _  took notice of them. But Katy shouted, laughing and  _  to tell everyone about it. I had to get down on my knees and  _  her to shut up so my grandma wouldn't  _  and get hurt. After that happened, I  _  there were a million things about Grandma that were embarrassing. Once she took Jill and me out to Burger King.  Instead of  ordering our hamburgers well-done, she told the person behind the counter, \"They'll have two Whoppers well-to-do. \" Jill burst out laughing, but I almost  _  . After a while, I started wishing I could  _  Grandma in a closet. I even complained to my parents. Both my parents said I had to be careful not to make Grandma feel  _  in our home. Then last Wednesday, something happened that  _  everything completely. My teacher told us to help find interesting old people and  _  them about their  _  for a big Oral History project. I was trying to think of someone when Angie pushed me gently. \"Volunteer your grandmother,\" she whispered. \"She's  _  and rich in experience.\" That was the last thing I ever thought Angie would say about my grandma. This is how I ended up on  _  today interviewing my own grandmother before the whole school assembly . All my friends and teachers were listening to her  as if  she was a great heroine. I was  _  of my grandma and hoped she would  _  know that I had been ashamed of her.",
