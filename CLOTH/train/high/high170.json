After years of regular treatment, she    _  became healthy.\nTwo years ago, while Cathy was watching the Olympics, a dream came into her sweet little head--to be a swimmer. Last summer, she wanted to  _  out local swim team. She practiced hard and finally  _  it. The team practice,  _  was a rough start. She coughed and choked and could hardly  _  her first few weeks. Hearing her coughing bitterly one night, I decided to   _  her from it all. But Cathy woke me up early next morning, wearing her swimsuit  _  to go! I told her she shouldn't swim after a whole night's coughing, but she refused to   give up  and insisted she go .\nFrom that day on, Cathy kept swimming and didn't   _  a single practice. She had a  _  intention within herself to be the best she could be. My ten--year--old was growing and changing right before my eyes, into this  _  human being with a passion and a mission. There were moments of   _  of course: often she would be the last swimmer in the race. It was difficult for Cathy to accept that she wasn't a   _  ---ever. But that didn't stop her from trying. \nThen came the final awards ceremony at the end of the year. Cathy didn't expect any award but was still there to   cheer on  her friends and praise their accomplishments. As the ceremony was nearing the end, I suddenly heard the head coach  _  , \"The highest honor goes to Cathy!\" Looking around, he continued, \"Cathy has inspired us with her   _  and enthusiasm.  _  skills and talents bring great success, the most valuable asset one can hold is the heart.\"\nIt was the greatest  _  of my daughter's life. With all she hade been  _  in her ten years, this was the hour of true triumph .",
