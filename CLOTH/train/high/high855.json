    "article": "I was just out of college, only three days into a graduate year in England, and I was dragging a heavy backpack and suitcase through the London Underground. I was also crying uncontrollably.The day before yesterday, my uncle had   _   me that I was never to speak to him, his wife, or my two cousins again. Earlier, I had made a silly, joking remark. It was never meant to   _   my aunt's feelings, but it did. I spent the evening in an ugly blue telephone booth  ,   _   as I spoke to a friend who lived in England.\nAs a 22-year-old   _   had been raised to respect and trust adults, I believed my aunt and uncle when they said I'd   _   the relationship between themselves and family.\nWhen I left the phone booth, I went back to a   _   house with three closed bedroom doors. I did not sleep. In the morning, I   _   everyone get up and leave; no one knocked on my door. When it was quiet, I wrote a note of   _   and left it in my uncle's bedroom. I dragged my bags to the train station.\nComing to England seemed like a   _   decision. Still worse, no lifts at the station were working. Crying yet again, I tried to lift my suitcase up the   _  . Suddenly, there were hands. No one said anything,   _   each time I faced another set of steps, a hand would catch the suitcase handle and   _   it. At the top of the steps, the hand would let go, and I'd pull the suitcase to the next set. And just as I was about to   _   again, another hand would appear suddenly.\nIt happened several times. I never looked up and say thanks   _   I couldn't stop crying. I do remember that each   _   looked different, and that many different people helped me, without asking or saying anything.\nThat was the last time I saw or spoke to   _   of those four family members. Yet when I think about that terrible   _   in 1998, I remember those strangers' hands. They were there when I needed them, and even now, they pull me   _   the sadness of that memory. I think of them as I   _   the underground in Washington D. C. today, and I watch the citizens and tourists, just in case someone   _   a hand.",
