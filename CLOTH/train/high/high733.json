My mind was  _  .Was my husband able to find the  _  I laid out for the kids? Did the kids eat breakfast? More importantly, would he have enough  _  to look for a parking spot in this jungle of cars in order to meet me here with the  _  later on?\nAs I was  going through  the plan in my mind, I saw a parking space. Since there was not much  _  , I decided to back up my giant truck between the two white lines so that leaving would be  _  after the conference ended.\nAs I adjusted the  _  of my truck and started reversing ,another car came out of nowhere and  _  to take my parking spot. I signaled to the  _  that I was about to back up into the space, but she squeezed by me and  _  her SUV in my spot! I couldn't believe how rude she was! It made me so  _  that I got out of my car and stared at the lady. By the way she was dressed, I could  _  she was on her way to the conference.\nI  _  at her, \"That was not very angelic behavior!\"\nMuch to my surprise, she completely  _  me, and I stormed off.\nAfter a few minutes, I found  _  parking space...behind a smelly dustbin and about a mile away from the conference. Once I  _  myself down and tried to view the matter from a(n)  _  angle, the possibility entered my mind that the woman may have needed the spot  more than  I did.\nLater, I noticed she was actually one of the vendors  at the conference. She must have been  _  to get there quickly in order to set up her booth and display her merchandise.",
