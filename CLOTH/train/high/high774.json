The fact is,  as long as  it  is a relationship involving people, there will always be conflicts once in a while because  _  human beings are complicated .\nI guess even in the animal kingdom there are complications, too. For instance, just last weekend l thought my neighbor's cows were  _  .They like standing outside our gate where there is a huge tree they use to  _  themselves from the burning sun. Anyway, it was quite  _  that the grey cow was angry about something and since I didn't  _  \"cows\", I couldn't tell what she was complaining about. My guess was that one of the other cows had done/said something to  _  her because there was one cow she kept \"addressing\".\nI guess this goes to  _  tat as long as one is breathing (man or animal), misunderstandings and  _  .will always happen, regardless of whether it is at home or at the office, until one is finally  _  .\nThe  _  is how you handle your displeasure. How do you conduct your arguments? What words do you use7 After the argument, do you ever sit back and probably  _  anything that you might have said in anger? I ask this  _  I know for a fact that when you are angry, the likelihood of having the best  _  you'll ever regret is very high. The words you speak to someone can either build them up, or break them down, or start\na  _  in their heart or put it out completely. That is how  _  words are. Words have the power to  _  or destroy.\nIf you do not want to hurt those you come into  _  with, remember to be careful with your words because once they are  _  ,they can only be forgiven, not forgotten.",
