    "article": "Still in shock I wandered about the house trying to decide what to put into the suitcases.  _   that evening I had received a call from my hometown in Missouri telling me that my brother and his wife had been killed in a car   _  . \" Come as soon as you can,\"   _   my mother.\nWhile Larry, my husband, made plane   _   for the following morning, I aimlessly  picked up   things and put them down. I couldn't focus. Occasionally, someone phoned and said, \"   _   there's anything I can do, let me know.\" \"Thank you very much, \" I'd  _  . But I didn't know what to ask for.\nWhen the   _   rang, I   _   slowly and opened the door, seeing Emerson, our neighbor, standing on the porch . \" I've come to   _   your shoes,\" he said. Confused, I asked him to repeat. \"I just want to   _  you. I remember when my father died, it   _  me hours to get the children's shoes cleaned and shined for the funeral. So that's what I've come to do for you. Give me all your shoes-not just your good shoes ,but all your shoes.\"\nWhile Emerson  _   newspaper on the kitchen floor, I gathered Larry's shoes, my heels and the children's   _   shoes. While we cleared the supper dishes, he continued to work, saying nothing.\nOne by one , the jobs fell into   _  . I went into the laundry room to put a load of wash into the dryer, returning to the kitchen to find that Emerson had left. In a line against one wall stood all our shoes, spotless. I could put the shoes   _   into the suitcase.\nNow, whenever I   hear of  an acquaintance who has lost a loved one, I no longer call with the vague  offer, \" If there's anything I can do...\" Now I try to think of one  _   task that suits that person's need -such washing the family car, house-sitting   _  the funeral...And if the person says to me, \" How did you know I needed that done?\" I reply, \"It's because a man   _  cleaned my shoes. \"",
