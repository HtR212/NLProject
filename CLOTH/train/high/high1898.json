    "article": "We lived in a very quiet neighbourhood. Early one evening, my wife asked me to go to the   _   to get some soft drinks. My daughter Holly had just got her   _   permit, so I asked her to drive my truck for the shopping instead, as a chance of   _  .\nWhile we were waiting for Holly, my son talked about how much he liked my truck, and I told him I enjoyed having it, too. But I was more or less   _   about Holly. Just then, we heard a loud noise outside. My son looked out and   _  , \"Daddy! Daddy! Holly ... Truck!\"\n\"Oh, my God!\"   _   I ran to the door, I found that the truck had been brought to a stop. \nThe   _   had happened in our own driveway. With   _   experience, Holly had my truck hit our garage wall.   _  , Holly was unhurt, but when I reached her, she was crying and saying, \"Oh, Dad, I'm sorry. I know how much you   _   this truck.\" I held her in my arms as she cried.\nI remember how   _   Holly was the night she had my truck damaged, and how I   _   her. The repaired truck reminds me of what really 23 _  in my life. One day, when Holly   looks back on   her life, she will certainly know that I love my 25 _  a thousand times more than anything else.",
