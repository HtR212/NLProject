    "article": "As a young social worker in a New York City psychiatric clinic, I was asked to see Roz, a 20-year-old woman who had been referred to us from another psychiatric clinic. It was an  _  referral in that no information was received  ahead of  her first appointment. I was told to \"play it by ear\", and to  figure out  what her problems were and what she needed.  _  an examination to go on, I saw Roz as an unhappy, misunderstood young woman who hadn't been listened to in her earlier treatment. Her family situation was unpleasant. I didn't see her as disturbed,  _  rather as lonely and misunderstood. She responded so  _  to being heard. I encouraged her to start a life worth living -- to find a job, a satisfying place to live and new relationships. We hit it off well, and she  _  making important changes in her life. The records from the previous psychiatric clinic arrived a month after Roz and I began our successful work together. To my complete surprise, her records were several inches thick,  _  a long period of psychiastric hospitalization. Her diagnosis was \"paranoid schizophrenic \", with a  _  that she was \"hopeless\". That had not been my experience with Roz at all so I decided to forget those pieces of paper. I never treated her as if she had that \"hopeless\" treatment. I did find out about the horrors for Roz of the hospitalization, of being drugged, separated and abused. I also learned a lot from her about  _  such deeply and unforgettably shocking circumstances. First Roz found a job, then a place to live away from her difficult  _  . After several months of working together, she introduced me to her husband-to-be, a successful businessman who adored her. When we  _  our treatment, Roz gave me the gift of a silver bookmark and a note that said, \"Thank you for believing and encouraging me.\"",
