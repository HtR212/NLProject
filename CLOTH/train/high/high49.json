    "article": "Years ago I gave a speech called \"Powerful Phrases for Positive People.\" These are very   _  but powerful phrases\nthat we all like to  _  : \"I'm proud of you.\" \"I believe  _  you.\" \"I trust you.\" \"I love you.\" \"You can\ndo it.\"\n  _   Thanksgiving Day approaching, we   _  all be focused on another one of these powerful phrases, in   _  : \"I thank you.\" We can never  _  out that phrase. It should always be  _  the\ntip of our  _  if we are truly grateful to others\nwho help us each day and to  _  who has richly blessed  us with more wealth and freedom than any other countries in history. \n   Despite all of God's abundant  blessings, we're often too   _  to give\nthanks and too quick to complain. Maybe we're so focused on ourselves and  _  with our lives that we forget to give thanks. Or maybe it's because\nthose of us in America have gotten used to our level of wealth and leisure\nwhich is beyond even the imagination of much of the world's population.\nWe tend to   _  our blessings for\ngranted, like the story about a homeowner who  _  a\nreal-estate agent  to prepare an ad to   _  his home. The\nhomeowner  _  the ad in the paper about his\nhome's many  _  features. He called the\nreal-estate agent to say he no longer wished to sell the house. When  _  what changed his mind, the homeowner said, \"After reading your ad, I  _  that I already live in the house I have  _  wanted to live in.\"\n   In this season of Thanksgiving in particular, it's time to count our blessings and use that simple phrase, \"I thank you.\"",
