    "article": "Years ago while lying in my hammock and drinking JB from the bottle, I  _  my dog dragging something under the fence.  _  looking at it carefully, to my  _  , I realized it was the next-door neighbor's 10-year-old daughter's rabbit. For years I  had watched  her come home from school and  _  straight out to its cage,  _  it and play with it in the yard. I know today  _  be no different.  Fearing  for our dog, I had to think fast. The rabbit died and was quite dirty, as if it had  put up  quite a struggle, so I washed it off with the plastic  _  , combed it with the dog brush and blew it  _  with the leaf blower . Upon finishing its grooming , I jumped the  _  and put it back in its cage hoping its  _  would be accepted as \" natural causes\".  _  to the hammock and JB. Within the hour the neighbor's car  pulled in  as usual and out came the little girl,  _  as usual she headed straight for the cage. Only this time did she stop about six feet away and  _  \" D-A-D-D-Y-!!\" Her father,  _  , stood looking at the cage. Being the good neighbor, I rushed to the fence and asked if there was anything I could do. Her father  less  than calmly shouted, \"What kind of  _  person would dig up a little girl's dead rabbit and put it back in its cage?\"",
