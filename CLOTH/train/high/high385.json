    "article": "Speaking Up\nI never looked up when my friends were talking and joking about the retarded   boy a few tables away. It didn't even cross my mind that he might feel   _   when people whispered about him. So I just let them talk.\nThen came the day when I learned my brother Captain's testing for autism   came out positive . I had never thought about him like that. I broke   _  , crying. Everything had just changed. He was no longer a(n)   _   little boy.\nOver time, I was able to accept his   _   a little more. We had to   _   because Captain needed treatment. So Captain and I both started at a new school. One day, I was standing in the bus line waiting when a \"short\" bus (for the retarded) came and   _   some kids up. The children in the other line started making   _   about the \"retarded\" on that bus and I felt a   _   feeling in my heart. I said quietly that those comments weren't very nice,   _   no one listened. \nMy family moved again. In the new school I got a   _   to speak up pretty soon. That day, in a band class, my teacher   _   our playing to make some comments, \"... Guys, we're playing like the kids on the short bus! Come on!\"\nThe entire room was laughing loudly. I felt very   _  . Then, I raised my hand. I wasn't sure what I was going to say but I wanted to be heard.\nThe whole class   _   down. My mouth opened and this came out:\"I don't think we should make fun of the short bus, because there are people on that bus who have a lot in common with us and have the same feelings as we do.\" I could feel my   _   getting louder. \"So I would   _   it if you didn't make fun of them.\"\nThe room was very quiet and everyone stared at me. My teacher   _   for the words and then started the song again. At the end of the class, everyone was giving me strange looks. But I didn't   _  , because I knew three things: I had spoken the   _  . I had taught everyone something, and while everyone in the classroom was being a follower, I had   _   to take a different path since I wanted to become a   _   and a role model.",
