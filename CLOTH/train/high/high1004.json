    "article": "Richard Rice, a fast-talking man paced up and down in front of freshmen debate class,   _  us about his high expectations. We were special, he declared on our first day at Oak Park High School. But there would be no  _  to success. Only those who worked hard would shine.\nSuddenly Mr. Rice  _   in mid-sentence and stared at me. \"You know,\" he said, \"You're black!\" Somehow, I knew he  wasn't   trying to hurt me.\nMr. Rice was no   _  teacher. I entered high school not  _  quite sure what debate was. I left his class four years later as an outstanding debater. Even today, I'm not sure what   _  such a great teacher of him. He always said  _   he was thinking. And he was  _  . He'd   _   out of the classroom angrily if he thought a student was giving   less than  his effort. The worst thing with us was to be taken no notice of.   _  , being torn apart by Mr. Rice in the middle of a practice debate meant you were one of his favourites. He wasn't always  _   on us. I'll never forget the Nations Student Debate, at which my calm delivery and my firm grasp of the problems disappeared. The only face I could   make out   in the audience was Mr. Rice's face. I could   _  I was doing terribly just by looking at him. After it was over, he came     _  to me. \"Not my best   _   ,\" I said. He shook his head, \"No,\" Then, to my  _   , he gave me a hug.\nMr. Rice's style didn't make him a great teacher for everyone. Many kids  _  out of the debate class after the first year. But for me four years with him was my unforgettable  _   of a lifetime.",
