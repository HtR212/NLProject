    "article": "That cold January night, I was growing sick of my life in San Francisco. There I was, walking home at one in the morning after a tiring  _  at the theatre. With opening night only a week away, I was  _  learning my lines. I was having trouble  dealing with  my part-time job at the bank and my acting at night at the same time. As I walked, I thought seriously  _  giving up both acting and San Francisco.  City life  had become too much for me. As I walked down  _  streets under tall buildings, I felt very  _  and cold. I began running, both to keep warm and to keep away from any possible robbers. Very few people were still out except a few sad-looking homeless people under blankets. About a block from my apartment, I heard a sound behind me. I turned  _  , half expecting to see someone with a knife or a gun. The street was empty.  All  I saw was a shining streetlight.  _  , the noise had made me nervous, so I started to run fast. Not until I reached my apartment building and unlocked the door did I realize what the noise had been. It had been my wallet falling to the sidewalk.  _  I wasn't cold or tired anymore. I ran out of the door and back to  _  I'd heard the noise.  Although  I searched the sidewalk anxiously for fifteen minutes, my wallet was nowhere to be found. Just as I was about  to give up  the search, I heard the garbage truck pull up to the sidewalk next to me. When a voice  called  from the inside. \"Alisa Camacho?\" I thought I was dreaming. How could this man know my name? The door opened, and out jumped a small red-haired man with an  _  look in his eyes. \"Is this what you're looking for?\" he asked,  holding up  a small square shape. It was nearly 3 a. m. by the time I got into bed. I  _  get much sleep that night, but I had gotten my wallet back. I  _  had gotten back some enjoyment of city life. I realized that the city couldn't be a bad place  as long as  people were willing to help each other.",
