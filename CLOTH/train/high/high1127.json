For Markita and her mother, who worked 42 _  a waitress in New York after her husband left them when Markita was eight, their   _   was to travel the globe. \"I'll work hard to make enough money to send you to 44 _ ,\" her mother said one day. \"You'll go to college and when you 45 _ , you'll make enough money to take you and me around the world. Okay?\"\nSo at age 13 when Markita 46 _  in her Girl Scout   magazine that the scout who sold the most cookies would   _   an all-expenses-paid trip for two around the world, she   _   to sell all the Girl Scout cookies she could----more Girl Scout cookies than anyone in the world, ever.\nBut desire alone is not   _  . To make her dream come true, Markita knew she needed a plan.\nHer aunt   _  . \"When you are doing business, dress like you are doing business. 51 _    your Girl Scout uniform. Always smile, whether they buy or not, always be 52 _ . And don't ask them to buy your cookies; ask them to 53 _ .\"\nLots of other Scouts may have   _   that trip around the world. But only Markita went off in her uniform each day after   _  . \"Hi, I have a dream. I'm earning a trip around the world for me and my mom by selling Girl Scout cookies,\" she'd say   _   the door. \"Would you like to invest in one dozen or two dozen boxes of cookies?\"\nMarkita   _   3,526 boxes of Girl Scout cookies that year and won her trip around the world.\nMarkita is not   smarter   than thousands of other people.
