He had the   _   of walking on the beach before he began his work.\nOne day he was walking along the   _  . As he looked down the beach, he saw a human   _   moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself at the   _  of someone who would dance on the beach. So he began to walk faster to   catch up  .\nAs he got   _  , he saw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing, but   _   he was reaching down to the shore,   picking up   something very gently and throwing it into the   _  .\nAs he got closer he   called out  ,\"Good morning!What are you doing?\"\nThe young man paused,   _   up and replied, \"Throwing starfish in the ocean.\"\n\"I   _   I should have asked, why are you throwing starfish in the sea?\"\n\"This sun is   _   and the tide is going out. And if I don't throw them in they'll   _  .\"\n\"But, young man, don't you   _   that there are miles and miles of beach and starfish all along it? You can't possibly make a   _  !\"\nThe young man listened   _  . Then he bent down, picked another starfish and threw it into the sea,   _   the breaking waves and said, \"It really mattered for that one.\"\nThere is something very 59 _  in each and every one of us. We have all been   _   with the ability to make difference. And if we can become aware of that gift, we will gain through the strength of our visions the power to shape the future.\nWe must each find our starfish. And if we throw our starfish wisely and well, the world will be blessed.",
