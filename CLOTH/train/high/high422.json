    "article": "It was Valentine's Day, my freshman year of college. I was so young, the romantic type. All I wanted was a rose. A single rose to  _  up my Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day at school was over,and I had no rose to  _  in my locker like I had hoped. I came home a little  _  . I sat in my room dreaming about next year's romantic Valentine's Day  _  the doorbell rang. There at the front door was a deliveryman  _  one single rose to my house. Surely this rose wasn't for me. I didn't have such  _  . I closed the front door with a single rose in my hand and gave it to my mother. \"  _  the card!\" she insisted when I told her it must be for her. I unsealed the envelope as my hands were  _  . I slowly lifted the card and read what it said: To Amanda From someone who cares I must have read it twenty times in a matter of seconds,  _  my eyes weren't playing tricks on me. But they weren't. The rose was for me. I must have been  _  for about five minutes, until I started  _  the obvious people and  _  them of sending me a rose and playing a joke on my  _  romantic heart. No one knew who sent it to me. My friends, family and relatives were as  _  to hear I got a rose from a  _  someone as much as I was. I was on cloud nine for weeks. I  _  did figure out who was it who sent me that rose.  _  I did figure something else out. It didn't  _  if it was a guy who secretly  _  me who sent me that rose. What mattered was that it was from someone who  _  about me and wanted to brighten up my day.",
