I  _  , everybody expects you to be special or  _  , and I'm just an average student; and I'm average, too, when it  comes to  basketball, football, soccer, and baseball.\nI often wonder  _  my father ever had a son like me. I mean he's so  _  and so good at everything. So I would often dream about doing something amazing to  _  my father and make him  proud of  me.\nIn one class, my teacher  _  a Father's Day essay contest for us and the winners' essays would be read in front of all the parents and students. After school I walked home,  thinking about  my father, whom I would write about in my essay. One of my classmates said, \"I  _  you'll win the contest, David. You're the only one in town who could write about being the son of an astronaut.\"\nMy father is an astronaut -- I would start out with that?  No. The whole country and maybe even the whole  _  saw my father as an astronaut,  _  that wasn't the way I saw him.\nHow did I  _  my father? Hmm.\nI saw him sitting with me in the  _  when I was little and had a nightmare .\nI saw him teaching me how to throw a baseball.\nI remembered how he  _  me with a new little dog at my eighth birthday party.\nAnd I remembered how he tried to  _  death to me when Grandpa Bob died.\nTo me, he wasn't a world-famous astronaut, just my dad.\nEventually I won the second prize. When I finished reading my essay, the  _  applauded. I saw my father blowing his nose. I went back to my seat.\nDad nodded to me,  _  his throat, and put his hand on my shoulder. \"Son, this is the  _  moment of my life,\" he said.\nIt was the proudest moment of my life, too. Maybe I'll never be a great hero or win a Nobel Prize, but just then, it was  _  just to be my father's son.",
