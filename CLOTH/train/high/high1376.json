    "article": "Dear Seth, You're only three years old, and at this point in your life you can't read, much less understand what I'm going to try to tell you in this letter. But I've been thinking a lot about the life that you have  ahead of  you, about my life so far as I  _  on what I've learned, and about my role as a dad in trying to prepare you for the  _  that you will face in the coming years. Be thankful. You are at a wonderful  _  of life. You have still many wonderful stages of life, but they are not without their costs and  _  . I hope to help you along your path by sharing some of the best of  _  I've learned. As with any advice, take it with a grain of  _  . What works for me  _  not work for you. Life can be cruel.

There's not much you can do about these people except  learn  to deal with them, and learn to choose friends who are kind to you, who  _  care about you, who make you feel good about yourself. When you find friends like this,  hold onto  them, treasure them, spend time with them, be kind to them and love them. There will be  _  when you meet with disappointment instead of success. Life won't always  turn out  the way you want. This is just another thing you'll have to learn to deal with. But instead of letting these things get you down, push on,  _  disappointment and learn to persevere and to pursue your dreams  _  pitfalls. Learn to turn negatives into positives, and you'll do much better in  _  . You will also face heartbreak and abandonment by those you love. I hope you don't have to face this too much, but it happens. Again there is not much you can do but to heal, and to move on with your life. Let these pains become stepping stones to better things in life, and learn to use them to make you  _  .",
