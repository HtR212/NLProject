    "article": "Not long ago, I was at a state conference   with a group preparing for a week of meetings. I walked into the room where a handful of volunteers were   _   collating   handouts. I asked if I could help. One of the ladies   _   said \"Oh, no, thank you\" and offered me a chair to just sit while they worked.\nThen, another volunteer came into the room, saw me sitting there doing nothing and said: \"Hey, Larry, come on over here. There's work to do, and you can help.\" He put a couple of chairs   _  , placed two stacks of handouts on them and   _  : \"OK, the left sheet goes on top of the right one.\"\n\"Fine. I can handle that,\" I said. And just like that, I was now part of the team.\nThis member of the group saw that my   _   did not mean an inability to help.   _  , I thanked him for having included me, and asked   _   motivated his action. He said: \"Well, I figured   _   one more set of hands we'd finish more quickly. I was just using   common sense  .\"\nI'm sure that the kind folks who initially     turned down   my offer of help did not mean to offend   me. It just seemed more appropriate to them to say \"No, thank you\" than to stop their work and try and   figure out   how to include me. And that's the real issue here. Too often, people with disabilities are   _   - within their   _   or within a social setting - because of their disability and not because of their inability.\nIt's important for all of us to feel part of the group and to feel that we   _  . It's important to our self-esteem  . And it is even more important for people with disabilities.   _   means we are accepted, appreciated and   _   as a full and   _   member of the group. It sends a   _   that states: \"To us, your abilities are more important than your disability.\"",
