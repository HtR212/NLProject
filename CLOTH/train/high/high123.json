    "article": "When he was a teenager in Northern India's Assam District about 30 years ago, Jadav \"Molai\" Payeng began planting seeds in a sandbar near his birthplace. A few years later, he moved to the area and   _   the seed-planting and tree-caring into his life's work, planting seeds and helping them grow over a wide area that was   _   at first.\nIn the past 30 years, his seed-planting   _   have resulted in a huge, 1,360-acre jungle in Assam, a forest ecosystem   that has left an unbelievable mark on the Indian landscape and stands as a   _   to Payeng's devotion.\nAt first, the forest department told Payeng that trees could not grow in that area. He didn't think so;   _   he devoted himself to the task of caring for the forest, and his devotion has   _   results. The Molai woods, in addition to being covered with green grasses, is now   _  to a great many creatures big and small,   _   birds, deer, tigers, and elephants.\nJadav \"Molai\" Payeng is a   _   to those animals, to the ecosystem in the area, and to conservationists   across India. But he is   _   a hero to us, people living oceans away who don't   _   work in forestry or in the environment industry. Payeng is a hero   _   he has proven that with   _  , blood, sweat, knowledge, and devotion to making a difference, one person can truly make a difference, and a large difference, to the world.\nIt's easy for us not to consider the   _   that we can have on the people and places around us. It's   _   to feel small when we are faced with the difficulties that   _   us. But it's important to remember that our actions, no matter how   _   they may be, make a difference. Whether it's bringing a smile to someone's day or bringing a forest ecosystem   _   to life, the little acts of   _   and good have a great effect.\nOur small actions may not necessarily   _   to a forest and safe living place for animals, but they have the potential (;) to grow all the same.",
