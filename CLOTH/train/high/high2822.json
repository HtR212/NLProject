Therefore, I promised to  _  telling lies. A few days later, my sister and I were invited to spend the weekend with my aunt. On that day, someone took one of Aunt Kim's erasers and  _  it across the top of the TV. The eraser ruined the shiny  _  of the TV. When Aunt Kim discovered the destrction, all three of us were called into the TV room and asked to tell the  _  . Nobody did! The next thing I knew was that she was on the phone with my parents and they were on their way to  _  me up. It must be me! I was the  _  . I was taken home and sent to my room. I begged them to believe that I was innocent, but no one  _  . I stayed in my room the rest of that day. My parents  _  let me out for dinner. And then there was a knock at the front door. Aunt Kim was standing there. It turned out that my younger sister finally felt  _  ! She  _  that she was the one who rubbed the eraser on the TV. Aunt Kim had come to get me. I was invited back! I don't even remember being  _  at my sister. I learned a valuable lesson about lying.

I promised myself right then  _  to lie again.",
