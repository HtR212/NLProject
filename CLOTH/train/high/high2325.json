    "article": "After years of experience, Brenda was faced with a challenge in Sunday School. However, she just didn't know how to  deal with  it in a good way. She had never been asked to teach a child quite like Cindy! Cindy, you see, was  _  . She came from a broken home. And although she was really  _  , she thought she was so bad that she could not be successful.  In fact  , Cindy needed care, and most of all, Cindy needed love! There just had to be a way of  _  her. Day after day, Brenda would pray for Cindy, yet Sunday would come and go and she saw  _  , if any, change. Then one day Brenda asked Cindy if she could  _  a role in a Christmas programme the children were  _  to do. Cindy's answer was, \"Don't you think you can find someone better than me?\" \"Better than you?\" came Brenda's  _  . \"What makes you think there is  anyone  better than you?\" \"Well, I've  _  been asked to do anything before because I'm not good. I won't get the part  _  and then everyone will be mad at me for messing up their  _  ,\" came Cindy's answer. \"Oh, Cindy,\" said Brenda in a  _  voice. \"I am so  _  that you think that, but you are so wrong. Don't you realize how  _  you are?\" \"No,\"  _  a reply in a low voice because Cindy was now in  _  . \"But Cindy, in my eyes, you are special and you can also do somethin g well like others,\" Brenda said. \"Really? Do you think so really? Thank you, Miss Brenda! Nobody has believed in me like you.  _  I'll have a try,\" said Cindy as she  _  a hug from her teacher for the first time!",
