For as long as I could remember I had struggled with anxiety. After I left university, I made friends with a Moroccan woman at work. One day she invited me to  _  her and her family back home. I wanted to, but I would have to travel there  _  and I knew we would be in a very rural area. How would I cope with my  _  ? Then one day it  _  to me that I had a life to live. I could choose to let anxiety  _  me or I could go to Morocco and  _  something different. I was 23 years old and had never been out of the UK alone. The journey to Morocco  _  something inside me. I managed to cope with my anxiety. The sense of  _  was overwhelming and still to this day when I get afraid of going somewhere alone, I remember how  _  it felt when I arrived in Morocco. Upon arrival I was so  _  for the generous welcome I received. My friend's family had arranged a welcome party. The people were so loving toward me. As a moment of  _  felt in a faraway village, this reminded me that I was \"good enough\", which helped to  _  my anxiety. Waking up the next day, in the morning light, I saw the area where we were. I was  _  by how rural it was - and the realization that these people had very few  _  . In the days afterwards, I traveled around Morocco. We went to Marrakesh and  _  the Atlas mountains. We had the most amazing food - lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. At the end of my  _  something inside me had changed. I realized I had not felt anxious for nearly two weeks. Experiencing a different culture far away from home helped me to realize what is important in life, what really  _  , and with that my anxiety  _  . When I returned home I was much more active in  _  my anxiety. Working with people, helping them  _  their anxiety, is how I can share the love I found in Morocco.",
