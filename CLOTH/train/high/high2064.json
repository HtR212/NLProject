I'm one short of putting my laundry in the dryer . \" I  _  to think about it for a few seconds and considered whether I'd be  _  to give a quarter away. I found myself  _  her, thinking about why she didn't  _  four quarters down from her room with her, as if she had  _  to be one short so she could ask someone else for it. (Later I knew  _  that was not the case.) But I didn't have any reason to  _  her. Then I responded, \"Yeah, I think I have the only one,\" though fully  _  that I had three. \"Here you go,\" I said with a smile. \"Thanks,\" she responded,  _  that she could have clean clothes to wear the next morning. A few moments later the girl  _  and gave a dollar bill to me. \"Why are you giving this to me?\" I asked,  _  . \"Oh, because you were kind to me, so I'm just giving back the  _  .\" It's just a dollar, but I felt it was  _  . More so because I hadn't given that quarter with such nice  _  , the way she gave that dollar to me. I felt like it was the first time I ever  _  something greater in return for something so  _  that I had given. I saw the power of kindness and generosity in a  _  way. I thought it was so worth giving that quarter away. Giving and  _  don't usually happen hand-in-hand,  _  when it does, like it did this time, it makes one think about why generosity is so powerful in the first place.",
