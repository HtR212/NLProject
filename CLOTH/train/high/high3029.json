He couldn't read his own handwriting. 22 _  he was a bright student. He discussed adult subjects with nearly adult comprehension. His work in no way reflected his23 _  .\nSo when Simon's mother entered the room, my palms  were sweating. I was completely24 _  for her lisses on both my cheeks. \"I came to thank you,\" she said, surprising me beyond speech. 25 Because of  me, Simon had become a different person. He talked of how he26 _  me, he had began to make friends, and for the first time in his twelve years, he had 27 _  spent an afternoon at a friend's house. She wanted to tell me how grateful she was for the 28 _ I had nurtured  in her son. She kissed me again and left.\nI sat, stunned  , for about half an hour, 29 _  what had just happened. How did I make such a life-changing difference to that boy without 30 _  knowing it? What I finally came to 31 _  was one day, several months before, when some students were 32 _  reports in the front of the class, Jeanne spoke 33 _  , and to encourage her to raise her voice, L had sai, \"Speak up. Simon's the expert on this. He is the 34 _  one you have to convince, and he can't hear you in the 35 _  of the room.\" That was it. From that day on, Simon had sat up straighter, paid more attention, 36 _  more, and became happy. And it was all because he 37 _ to be the last kid in the last row. The boy who most needed 38 _  was the one who took the last seat that day.\nIt taught me the most39 _  lesson over the years of my teaching career, and I'm thankful that it came 40 _  and positively. A small kindness can indeed make a difference.",
