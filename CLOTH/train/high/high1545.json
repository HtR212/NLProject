    "article": "The phone call came one cool winter day. I was   _  that my father was seriously ill.\nIt had been long since I'd seen my father. Ever since his  _  from my mom, my father had lived alone in a small trailer  in California, 500 miles away from me. The real   _  between us seemed so much greater. I was in no hurry to   _  that, but somehow I heard myself   _  to the owner of the trailer to be there the next day.\nThe whole drive down,   _  flashed through my mind. I remembered my father, the proud Marine. He made sure the first song I   _  was the Marine Hymn(<<>> ). He tore off the Christmas   _  all the decorations the rest of us had   put up  and rehung them so there was   _  the same space between them. But we didn't need to   _  those military orders, as we were not soldiers. I remembered   _  the battles he had with my mother. I remembered hoping to hear my father say   _  once, \"I love you, Patty,\" only to have him   _   at me, \"You can't do anything right!\"\nAnd now here I was standing outside his trailer, trying to   _  my courage to face him one more time. I knocked on the door, my hand and my whole body   _  . NO answer. Slowly I opened the door. I took a few  _  inside and stopped, too shocked to believe my eyes.\nMy father was sitting on his sofa, looking confused and crying. This wasn't the  _  man I had known growing up. He seemed broken.\nA sense of   _  overtook me, and I knew what I had to do. He would be my father forever. Without   _  , I went back inside and packed up all of my father's things. I would take him to my home-our home.",
