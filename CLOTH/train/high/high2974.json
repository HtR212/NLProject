It's the most money  _  paid for a one-cent piece. And yes, he said, the purchase made  _  . \"It's like our very first penny,\" Lipton, 55, told the Los Angeles Times on Sunday. \"It's such a(n)  _  coin. It's so important, so rare.\"\nThe coin is  _  10 similar coins known to exist that were  _  produced after the founding of the U.S. Mint  , said Jim Halperin, co-chairman of Heritage Auctions. It features a profile face  _  Miss Liberty, framed by a motto that was later abandoned, \"Liberty Parent of Science & Industry.\"\nLipton, who owns a coin wholesaling business   in Beverly Hills, had been eyeing the Birch Cent  _  he saw it in 1981 at a New York auction house. That year, Johns Hopkins University consigned (, ) the penny for auction, and it was  _  by New York City developer Donald G. Patrick  _  $200,000. Patrick consigned the coin to Texas-based Heritage Auctions. At the Orlando auction where Lipton  picked up  the Birch Cent, he  _  bought a quarter dollar from 1792 for $2,232,500.  _  , he paid about $4.8 million for 26 cents.\nLipton has  _  coins since he was 12 years old, and his full-time coin business  _  when he was just 17. He  _  that he was nervous about spending so much money, but now he's  _  his million-dollar coins will mature. \"They are a great store value, and will only be worth more  in the future  ,\" Lipton said. ''They are  _  Mona Lisas of our coinage.''",
