She lost her daughter and has a  _  heart. We need to take care of her a little while.\" Said her mother. \" Why, Mommy?\" \"You see, Susie, when someone is very, very sad, they have  _  doing the little things like making dinner or other housework. Because we're  _  of a community and Mrs. Smith won't ever be able to talk with her daughter or hug her. You are a very  _  girl, Susie; maybe you'll think of  some  way to help take care of Mrs. Smith.\" Susie thought  _  about this challenge and how she could do her  _  on caring for Mrs. Smith. A few minutes later, Susie knocked on her door. After a few moments, Mrs. Smith  greeted  the knock with a \"Hi, Susie.\" Susie noticed that Mrs. Smith didn't have that familiar musical  _  about her voice when she  _  someone. \"What can I do for you, Susie?\" asked Mrs. Smith. \"My mommy says that you lost your daughter and you're very, very sad with a broken heart.\" Susie  _  her hand out shyly. In it was a Band-Aid. \"This is for your broken heart.\" Mrs. Smith knelt down and hugged Susie. Through her  _  she said, \"Thank you, darling girl, this will  _  a lot.\" Mrs. Smith  _  Susie's act of kindness and took it one step  _  . She bought a small key ring with a picture frame ---- the ones  _  to carry keys and display a family  _  at the same time. Mrs. Smith placed Susie's Band-Aid in the frame to  _  her to heal a little every time she sees it. It has become her symbol for healing, while not  _  the joy and love she experienced with her daughter.",
