    "article": "The Ministry of Education has spared no efforts to bring on IT learning. What is its main aim? Is it to teach students how to learn the computer or is it meant to change the usual method of teaching in order to   _  students' strong interest in\ncomputers?\n     Teaching students computer knowledge and skills is different    _  giving class lessons through the\nuse of computers. And schools are beginning to pay much attention to using\ncomputers to teach students. There is  no doubt  about\nthe fact that IT learning plays an important role as a new teaching tool in\nthis day of technology.  _  ,  views differ on whether\nthe schools can achieve their targets, as success  depends on  whether they can make use of computers effectively.\n    Let's take the subject of Chinese as an example and see   _  difficulties the experts face in their IT\nmanagement. At present, 20 percent of lessons are given with the help of\ncomputers. In other words, in a period of 10 weeks, a Chinese- language teacher must spend two weeks to teach the subject   the new way  . In carrying out such a major policy\nas IT learning, the experts should know  the fact  that\ndifferent teachers teaching different subjects have different demands, thus\nmaking it  _  to see the policy through.\n     Some teachers, having already got some computer knowledge, will still be forced to   attend  \nAnother problem is that new teachers may be sent to work in schools   where  IT learning has just\nstarted. All teachers- including the seniors who are very   _  in teaching, who suddenly have no idea what to do when it comes to\ncomputers, will have to  _  from the very\nbeginning. They will become  _  and their\nteaching performances may be badly affected.\nThe experts have found out how much of each subject is taught by computers in every school, and have   _  all school to complete the given work. A hard- pressed teacher may put the daily teaching     _  or the courses onto the computer just to\norder the required time for IT learning and then  give lessons  the\nusual way. Furthermore, he may leave school work to his  _  through the computer before class comes to an end in order to \"complete\"\nhis IT learning  _  .  As far as  the teaching of the Chinese language is concerned, do computer lessons\nreally achieve the desire goals to raise the students' level of Chinese, pass\non common values and so on? I am not so sure.",
