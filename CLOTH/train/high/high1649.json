    "article": "One Christmas my husband and I travelled to visit family. Our first stop was to visit my parents in Oregon. My  _  gave me a plastic piggy bank as the Christmas gift. Then we continued north into Washington to visit his parents, but on the way we had some  _  problems. It was late, so we went to the nearest house to ask for  _  to sleep there until auto repair shop opened.\nThe woman who  _  the door was very kind, allowing us to stay. We had to  _  a few things from the truck, including the bank, still in its long box. The next morning my husband headed off  on foot  towards town, but was soon offered a  _  from the nice lady, and we were back on the road  _  afterwards.\nIt wasn't until we reached our destination that we realized we had  _  the piggy bank in the drive way. It sure was  _  and there was no chance of going back for  _  .\nOne day over a year later, when we were back in Oregon my mother came out of her house to  _  us with the same bank in her hand. I couldn't believe my  _  ! We had never told her we had lost it,  _  there it was!\nIt turns out that the nice lady found the box and read the  _  on the slipping label to get my mother's name. She then  _  my mother and handed it to her, who held on to it for quite some time until we saw her next.\nSo  because of  the very special lady, I was given the  _  Christmas gift twice. It was truly  _  to me, and now every time that bank gets filled up, I'll  _  my money to a local charity to \"pass on\" my fortunate good luck!",
