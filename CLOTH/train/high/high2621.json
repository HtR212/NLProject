The whole family 1  _  up their money for that 2  _  occasion , and when the great day arrived, Charles was always 3  _  with one small chocolate bar to eat 4  _  . And each time he 5  _  it, on those wonderful birthday mornings, he would place it 6  _  in a small wooden box that he 7  _  , and treasure it as though it were a bar of solid 8  _  ; and 9  _  the next few days, he would 10  _  himself only to look at it, but never to 11  _  it. Then at last, when he could 12  _  it no longer, he would peel back a tiny 13  _  of the paper wrapping at one corner to 14  _  a tiny bit of chocolate, and then he would take a tiny nibble ----just enough to allow the lovely sweet taste to 15  _  out slowly over his 16  _  . Then next day, he would take 17  another  tiny nibble, and so on, and so on. And 18  _  this way, Charlie would make his six-penny bar of birthday chocolate 19  _  him for more than a 20  _  .",
