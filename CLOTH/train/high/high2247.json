I am in Nova Scotia on a pilgrimage with Lise, my granddaughter, seeking roots for her, retracing  _  memory for me. Lise was one of the mobile children,  _  from house to house in childhood. She longs for a sense of  _  , and so we have come to Nova Scotia where my husband and I were born and where our ancestors  _  for 200 years. We soon  pull up  by the house and I tell her what it was like here, the memories  _  back, swift as the tide . Suddenly, I long to walk again in the  _  where I was once so gloriously a child. It still  belongs to  a member of the family, but has not been lived in for a while. We cannot go into the house, but I can still walk  _  the rooms in memory. Here, my mother  _  in her bedroom window and wrote in her diary. I can still see the enthusiastic family  _  into and out of the house. I could never have enough of being  _  them.
