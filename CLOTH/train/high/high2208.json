Shortly  _  they arrived, their conversation turned into complaints about  _  in work and life. In order to  _  his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned  _  a large pot of coffee and a variety of cups made of porcelain , plastic, glass or crystal. Some of  _  are plain looking, some expensive, and some are exquisite . The  _  told them to help themselves to the coffee. When  all  the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said: If you noticed, all the nice looking  _  cups were taken up,  _  behind the plain and cheap ones.  _  it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the  _  of your problems and stress.  _  all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup,  _  you consciously went for the best cups and were seeing each other's  _  . Now consider this:  _  is the coffee and the jobs, money and position in society are the cups. They are  just  tools to hold and contain life, and do not change the  _  of life. Sometimes, by concen- trating only on the cup, we  _  to enjoy the coffee God has provided. So, don't let the cups drive you. . .  _  the coffee instead.",
