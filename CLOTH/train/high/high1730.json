When Stephen Guyer's three children were growing up, he told them stories about how his grandfather, a banker,  _  all in the 1930s, but did not lose sight of what he valued most. In one of the darkest times  _  his strong-minded grandfather was nearly  _  , he loaded his family into the car and  _  them to see family members in Canada with a  _  , \"there are more important things in life than money\". The  _  took on a new meaning recently when Mr. Guyer downsized to  _  house from a more expensive and comfortable one. He was  _  that his children, a daughter, 15, and twins, 22, would be upset.To his surprise, they weren't.  _  , their reaction echoed their great-grandfather's.What they  cared about  was how warm the people were in the house and how  _  of their heart was accessible. Many parents are finding that family stories have surprising power to help children  _  hard times. Storytelling experts say the phenomenon reflects a growing  _  in telling tales, evidenced by a rise in storytelling events and festivals. A university  _  of 65 families with children aged from 14 to 16 found kids' ability to  _  parents' stories was linked to a lower rate of anger and anxiety. The  _  is telling the stories in a way children can  _  . We're not talking here about the kind of story that  _  , \" When I was a kid, I walked to school every day uphill both ways, barefoot in the snow.\" Instead, we should choose a story suited to the child's  _  , and make eye contact to create \"a personal experience\". We don't have to tell children  _  they should take from the story and what the moral is.",
