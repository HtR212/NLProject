With English as her second language and   _  education, the   _   didn't look bright for Lily.\nLily's father was a stubborn man who   _   took \"no\" for an answer. He   _  Lily to find a job. With small hope of gaining   one  ,each day she would just ride to the city, walk   _  about and return home at dusk.\nOn one of her   _  , Lily saw a sign at a big company.  _  ,she knocked on the very first door. In her   _   English, Lily told the office manager she was interested in the secretarial position. The manager   _   to give the girl a chance. He directed her to type a letter, and then   _  .Lily looked at the clock and saw it was11:40 am. She thought everyone would be leaving for   _   at noon, when she could   _  away in the crowd. But she knew she should   _   the letter.\nOn her first try, Lily   got through   one line of five words and made four mistakes. When he attempted the letter on her second try, she completed a full paragraph, but still made many mistakes. She looked at the clock:11:55--five minutes to   _  .Just then, the manager walked in. He came directly to Lily, read the letter and said, \"Lily, you're doing   _   work!\"\nWith those simple words of encouragement, her desire to escape disappeared and her   _   began to grow. Lily thought, \"Well, if he thinks it's good, then it must be good.
