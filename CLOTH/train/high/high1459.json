    "article": "Teaching anyone to think of others before themselves is, I believe, a life-long effort. For me right now, it might mean not buying that extra shirt or a cup of coffee and 41 _ saving the money to help someone   in need  . For my kids, it might mean sharing   _  , happily taking turns in the playground. I like to  _   thinking of others and finding a way to help them as \"kindness\".\nOn this particular day, instead of   _   a lot of money on a lunch out in the restaurant, we bought some  _   little toys to give to strangers. I asked the boys  _   they would like to give these toys to other children. At first they were disappointed because they wanted to   _   them. This wasn't surprising----I knew that if my mom bought a whole lot of great shirts which I thought were for me, and then said she wanted to give them away, I might at first be a bit   _   , too. So we   _   them and my oldest child   _   we keep one and give the others away to make others happy. We   _  this was a good idea and then they started to get excited about the   _   of giving them away, asking me who they could give them to and how. \nWe   cut out   some slips of paper, punched   a hole,   _   them to the little dolls, and then headed out for the local mall.\nThe boys were very excited to be on their way to   deliver   the toys, and I admitted I was a bit   _  . What would the parents think as we gave their child a toy? Would they be   _  , or not like the gift? But I took some deep   _   and realized that if we are doing something out of love, we can only give with open   _   and accept whatever is to come.",
