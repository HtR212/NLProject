A down-to-earth person is just the  _  of someone who acts important and proud.\nDown-to-earth persons  _  be important members of society.  _  they don't let their importance \"go to their heads\". They do not  _  hemselves to be better persons than others of less importance. Someone who is filled with his own importance and pride, often without cause, is  _  to have \"his nose in the air\". There is  _  way a person with his nose in the air can be down-to-earth.\nAmericans  _  another expression that means almost the same as down-to-earth. The expression is \"both-feet-on-the-ground\". Someone with both-feet-on-the-ground is a person with a good  _  of reality. He   _  what is called \"common sense\". He may have  _  ,  but he does not allow them to  _  his knowledge of what is real. The opposite kind of  _  is one who has hid \"head-in-the-clouds\". A man with his head-in-the-clouds is a dreamer whose  _  is not in the real world.\n  _  , such a dreamer can be brought back to reality.   _   words from a teacher can usually get a day-dreaming student to put both feet back on the ground.Usually, the person who is down-to-earth is very  _  to have both feet on the ground.  _  we have both our feet firmly on the ground, we are down-to-earth, and we act honestly and openly  _  others. Our lives are like the ground below us, said and strong.",
