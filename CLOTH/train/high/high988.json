And it seems that how to draw a line between too little praise and too much has become a high-pressure  _  act for parents. Self-esteem serves as a kind of tool to measure how much children feel valued and accepted by  _  . This sensitivity to others'  _  develops because of humans' need for social acceptance, which is considered to be  _  to survival. As early as age 8, children's self-esteem tends to rise and fall in response to feedbacks about  _  peers see them as likable or attractive.  _  , it can also be beneficial for kids to feel bad about themselves occasionally, if they behave in selfish, mean or hurtful ways that might  _  their ability to maintain relationships or hold a job in the future. In the past, many parents and educators believed that high self-esteem  _  happiness and success, and kids could gain self-esteem simply by getting  _  and awards from their parents, teachers and people around. But recently researchers have found self-esteem doesn't  bring about  these desired results. Instead, if parents praise their kids  _  , their self-esteem becomes focused on being very smart and being the best and being perfect. Building too much self-esteem of the children can not go as planned, making them feel  _  later on when they hit setbacks .

Children who have a  _  understanding of how they are seen by others tend to get recovered more readily  _  disappointment, depression or the like. The best path is a  _  road, helping children develop a positive but  _  view of themselves in relation to others by praising them for the  _  they invest and behaviors they are able to sustain, like \"It's  _  that you're working so hard on your homework. \"",
