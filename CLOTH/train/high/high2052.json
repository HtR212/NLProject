When we  _  our world to include others in a meaningful way, by making a  _  difference in their life, we increase our experience at the same time.\nThink back on a time when someone made a difference in your life.\nHere is one of mine: I was going to college, working part-time, and just  _  getting by financially. Standing in line at a local supermarket, I  _  a woman in the same line, thinking that she was not very attractive. As I was  checking out  , I discovered that I did not have enough money to pay; without  _  , that same woman I had been judging offered to  make up  the difference. It wasn't  _  , but what that person did made a lasting impression on me. She was a beautiful, caring soul who was willing to help a stranger in a(an)  _  situation. That happened over forty years ago and I remember it as  _  as if it was yesterday.\nOther examples are the numerous times I have had people smile at me, which  _  my day. I've often wondered if it was because I was smiling, which I  _  to do all the time, or because they were smiling to be  _  , which encouraged me to smile as well. It has probably been some of both. In  _  case, that simple gesture (a smile) makes a difference in my day.\nThere are  _  ways to make a significant difference in another's life. The question is: Are we doing it? It does not  _  anything, but it does require some effort on our part. I have found that as I do this consistently, the  _  go far beyond the energy required to do the deed. Looking for ways to brighten another person's day raises our vibration ,and when we act on it, we  _  the other person to raise their vibration as well -- it is  _  to each other.\nMake a difference in someone's life today, and  _  doing so every day. Today is a perfect time to start! If you are already doing so. bravo!",
