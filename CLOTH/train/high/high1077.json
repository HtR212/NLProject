It used to be pulling a horrible face or something   _  harmless, but more and more youngsters are doing things like   _   eggs or flour, and that can be very   _   , particularly for the elderly or weak.\"\nThis year,   _   , there's been a change. A group of teenagers who were tricking or treating   _  a house on fire. They broke in through a   _   and saw 63-year-old Mike Start unconscious on the floor. They   _   him out and sent him to hospital. One of the boys' mother said, \"I'm really   _  of them all.\"\nSo it seems a kinder, gentler Halloween might be    in store    for us all from now on.",
