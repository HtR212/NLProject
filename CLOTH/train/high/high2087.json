    "article": "\"All men are created equal\" is one idea that nearly every American would agree upon.  _  they sometimes betray the idea in their daily lives, they have a deep faith  _  in some fundamental way no one is born superior to anyone else. In the early years of American history, because titles of nobility were forbidden, no  _  class system developed in the United States. Firmly believing that being born into a lower class would not  _  them from success and they would have a better chance in America, thousands of immigrants  chose  to leave the European societies, where their  _  in life was determined  _  by the social class into which they were born. It was because the dreams of many of there immigrants were  realized  in their new country, though there might be  _  in some situations, that Americans came to believe in equality of opportunity. Americans do not mean that everyone should be  _  equal when they say they believe in equality of opportunity.  _  , they do mean that each person should have an equal chance for success. Abraham Lincoln once said, \"We wish to  _  the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else. When one starts poor, free society is  such  that he knows he can  _  his condition.\" However, competition is the price to be  _  for his equality of opportunity. Americans match their energy and intelligence against that of others in a competitive contest for success, because they believe competition  brings out  the best in any person. Indeed, the pressure of competition causes an American to be  _  , but it also places a constant emotional stress on him. In fact, in a society that gives so much  _  to those \"winners\",  _  does not compete successfully for whatever reason never  _  into it as well as those who do.",
