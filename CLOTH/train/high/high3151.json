    "article": "When I first came to the USA, I made friends with a neighbor who used to live only two blocks away from my street. We used to visit each other and go out together sometimes. This friend taught me a lot about American   _  , but in some cases I had to learn the hard way, because we didn't have enough time together for me to learn all about American culture from him. \nOne day, this friend invited me to a party. It wasn't a(n)   _   party, only some kind of informal get-together. Since it was summer, we had a picnic,   _   most of his American friends and  s were known to me, but there were others I had never met before.\nIt was the most   _   party for me when I noticed that everybody was wearing jeans and simple T-shirts for the day,   _   I arrived in proper dress with my shoes and hair all fixed for a fancy party. It was hard to explain my shame to the other   _  . When one of them turned around and said, \"What nice clothes! What's the occasion ?\" I felt my   _   burning hot. I didn't answer at all. If she knew how bad I already felt, she wouldn't have come near me. But she did. Maybe she didn't ask on purpose to make me feel   _   or uncomfortable, but my reaction had to do with the way I already felt. I could have told her I had to go to another party afterward, but I did not want to continue the   _  .\nMany times I thought of going home and   _  but I knew they would   _  . It would be even worse for me because I knew they would quickly think that I felt out of   _  . So I wanted to pretend that I was OK.\nI have already realized their   _   are different from mine, but after I talked to my friend, I was more persuaded that people here are more casual. They care less about formality   unless  it is a special occasion, like a   _  or a very formal invitation.",
