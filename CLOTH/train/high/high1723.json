Porky   _   her with great affection and attention, and always gave her some meat at the end of each day. But one day, Porky didn't give her meat any more. Flora got so worried that she decided to   figure out   why Porky did this to her.\nAfter several days, she found out that Porky   _   lots of meat in a big yellow box.   _   not to know anything about it, Flora asked Porky if she could have a little of the food that was   _   in the yellow box. He responded very   _  that she could not.\nFlora felt hurt, as well as   _  , and she couldn't stop   _   who Porky was keeping all that delicious-looking meat for. She was filling up with anger. That night, when the shop was   _  , she went over to the box, opened it, and   _   the meat.\nThe next morning, Porky arrived and found the meat had gone. Flora felt terrible. He asked her several times   _   she had taken the meat. At first she   _   it, but seeing Porky's worried face, she   _   to admit to it.\n\"What have you done?\" Porky   _  . \"I told you not to touch it! All that meat was   _  !That's why I haven't been able to give you   _   for days. They sent us a spoiled delivery.\"\nWithout delay, Flora was taken to a hospital, and the doctors there   _   to save Flora's life. Flora was very   _   and it taught her a big lesson. She learnt to stick to the   _   set by those who loved her, because that was much   _  . than doing whatever she wanted.",
