But forgiveness is possible and it can be surprisingly  _  to your physical and  _  health. \"People who forgive  _  less depression, anger and stress and more hopefulness,\" says Frederic Luskin, Ph.D.,  _  of Forgive for Good. \"So it can help  _  on the .wear and tear on our organs, reduce the wearing out of the immune system and  _  people to feel more vital.\" So how do you start the forgiveness? Try  _  these steps: Calm yourself. To defuse your  _  and try a simple stress-management technique. \"Take a couple of breaths and think of  _  that gives you pleasure: a  _  scene in nature, someone you love,\" Luskin says. Don't  wait for  an apology. \"Many times the person who hurt you has no  _  of apologizing,\" Luskin says. \"They may have wanted to hurt you or they just don't see things the same  _  . So if you wait for people to apologize ,you could be waiting a(n)  _  long time. \"Keep in mind that forgiveness does not necessarily mean  giving in  to the person who upsets you. Take the control away from your offender. Mentally replaying your  _  gives power to the person who caused you pain. \"  Instead  of focusing on your hurt feelings, learn to look for the love, beauty and kindness  _  you,\" Luskin says. Try to see things from the other person's perspective (;). If you empathize with that person, you may  _  that he or she was acting out of ignorance, fear even love. Recognize the benefits of forgiveness. Research has shown that people who forgive report more energy, better  _  and better sleep patterns. Don't forget to forgive yourself. \"For some people, forgiving themselves is the biggest challenge,\" Luskin says. \"But it can rob you of your self-confidence if you don't do it. \"",
