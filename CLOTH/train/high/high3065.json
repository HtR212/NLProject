These ceremonies sometimes become so noisy that the loud laughter 36 _  out the voice of the \"minister \". 37 _  the two students getting married often begin to laugh quietly.\nThe teacher, Mr. Allen, believes that marriage is a difficult and 38 _  business. He wants young people to understand that there must be many 39 _  after marriage. He believes that the 40 _  for these psychological and financial adjustments   should be understood before people 41 _ .\nMr. Allen doesn't only 42 _  his students to major problems faced 43 _ marriage such as illness or unemployment. He also lets them know the 44 _  problems they will face every day. He wants young people to know about all the difficulties and troubles that can throw marriage to the 45 _  point. He even familiarizes  his students with the problems of divorce   and the 46 _  that divorced men must pay child 47 _  money for their children and sometimes pay monthly some money to their 48 _ .\nIt has been nervous for some of the students to 49 _  the problems that a married couple often faces. 50 _  they took the course, they had not felt much 51 _  about the problems of marriage. 52 _  both students and parents feel that Mr. Allen's course is 53 _  and have supported the 54 _  publicly. Their statements and letters supporting the class have made the school more firmly believe that it's necessary to 55 _  the course again.",
