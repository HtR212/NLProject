    "article": "Have you ever noticed how families on TV always find time to eat meals together? In reality, people today are  _  than ever before and getting the whole family together for an evening meal is often  _  , as all members of the family have their own activities to get on with. For most of us, sitting down together at the  _  table is a thing of the past, but what effect does this have on family members and the relationships between them? One of the most important  _  of eating together as a family is that the family has a chance to communicate  _  with one another in a social environment. Many families  _  that the evening meal is the best time to discuss problems and share experiences. \"Eating together makes us feel  _  , and we often have our most useful conversations at these times,\" says Jane Digby, mother of three. So, although organizing a family meal everyday can be a(n)  _  , it can benefit family relationships. In addition, family meals help to improve children's  _  skills. They learn how to talk, how to listen and how to show consideration for other  _  in the conversation. Furthermore, eating together gives  _  a sense of security. Family psychotherapist Sue Taylor believes that children who eat with their  _  are far more confident as well as much more faithful to their families than children who don't. In spite of the many advantages of eating together, the  _  of modern life make it almost impossible for many people to do so. However, Sue Taylor insists that we should try to make  _  for family meals. \"Mealtimes are the most valuable time a family can spend together,\" she says. \"If you can't eat together every day, why not  _  and eat together three or four times a week? It really is worth the effort.\"",
