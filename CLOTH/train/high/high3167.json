Thus, scientists around the world are racing to learn how to rapidly diagnose, treat and stop the spread of a new, deadly disease. SASR---Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome---was   _   for the first time in February 2003 in Hanoi,   _   since then has infected more than 1,600 people in 15 countries, killing 63. At this   _  , there are more questions than answers surrounding the disease.\nSymptoms start   _   a fever over 100 degrees F, chills, headache or body   _  . Within a week, the patient has a dry cough, which might   _   to shortness of breath. In 10% to 20% of cases, patients require   _   ventilation  to breathe. About 3.5% die from the disease. Symptoms   _   begin in two to seven days, but some reports suggest it   _   take as long as ten days. Scientists are close to   _   a lab test to diagnose SARS. In the meantime, it is diagnosed by its symptoms. There is no an evidence   _   antibiotic or anti-viral medicine help,   _   doctors can offer only supportive care. Patients with SARS are kept in isolation to reduce the risk of   _  . Scientists aren't sure yet, but some researchers think it's a   _   discovered corona virus , the family of viruses that cause some common colds.  \nMost cases appear to have been passed through droplets  expelled when infected patients cough or sneeze. Family members of infected people and medical workers who care   _   them have been more likely to   _   the illness. But recent developments in Hong Kong suggest that the   _   might spread through air, or that the virus might   _   for two or three hours on doorknobs or other   _  . Health experts say it is unlikely, though, that   _   an elevator briefly with an infected person would be enough to pass the virus.",
