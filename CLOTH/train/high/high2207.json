    "article": "When I was a child, I loved to play a Chinese traditional game which was called Caught You! I  _  remember playing it every spring and fall if we had good weather. We usually looked forward to this  _  activity led by our teachers. At that time, we always  _  asking our teachers when and where to play, and our teachers used to  _  with a smile. They knew all of us were  _  to play the game. In this game, you  _  a large group of people (about 20-30 people), a piece of  _  , and a small ball. Our teachers  _  us to a park with a large green lawn , and then we sat down side by side in a large circle except for one person who was  _  by our teachers and sat outside the circle of students. To keep the game  _  well, one of the teachers was a leader and judge, who always gave  _  to make the game fair, reasonable and fun. At the beginning, we sat in the circle and one of us just sat a few feet away from the circle with his  _  blindfolded . That meant that he couldn't see who was  _  the small ball. This was a key point. As soon as everybody was  _  , the teacher declared a start. At that moment, we began to  _  the small ball one by one around the circle, and the one who sat  _  could shout \"Stop!\" at any time he wished. When we heard \"Stop!\", the student who had the ball in his hand had to  stand up  and sing a song or tell a story. From time to time, we laughed loudly because the players made some funny  _  and noise. The person outside the circle was  _  every five minutes. Now that I'm grown up, I  _  this game because it was a lot of fun.",
