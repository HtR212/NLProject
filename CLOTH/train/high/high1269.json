My parents had six children; so they had a million  _  for when you could be \"qualified\" to do things. It was a cold fall day, and I had just turned 8, the magic \"qualified\" age for  _  . The sky hung low and heavy over our heads as we  _  the steep streets that led to the stadium. Following my dad, I  _  to keep up with him. We bought our treats and climbed up to the top of the  _  . Our seats were in the third row from the top, so they were easy to  _  . It was very important for us to be in our seats before kick-off, which made everything leading up to it a mad  _  against the clock. We had just  _  into our seats when a light rain started to fall. Everyone opened their umbrellas.  _  the rain, Daddy and I had a great time.\nEach year, I returned to at least one  _  each season with my daddy. I  _  these moments and looked forward to our time together. My dad and I became best  _  at the football games. I could ask my dad about anything and knew that he would answer me  _  and told me everything he remembered.

Dad really wanted to go, and I really wanted to get those  _  ; so we drove a long trip to Utah. We ate huge hamburgers  _  we watched the game with the sun setting behind us.\nThis Sunday I will have the  _  of climbing those steep streets leading to the stadium once more. I walk a pace  _  now, so that my aged daddy can keep up with me.\nIn all my years of  _  , I haven't really learned much about football. The details of the actual game have never  _  to me as much as the time I spent with my dad. Truly, the most important thing I have learned from watching football is this: Treasure every moment that I have the privilege of spending with my great teacher and friend--MY DADDY.",
