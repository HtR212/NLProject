She told her little girl that the jar was  _  , and that she could write to her mommy about anything in the world and then put it in the jar. And  _  , in its place, there would be a  _  for her. Soon the jar became a special part of their lives.\nThe little girl loved to get  _  from her mommy. They always told her how  _  she was. Sometimes, too, there would be a little  _  in the jar with a note telling her how  _  her mommy was of her. She  _  all of her mommy's letters in a pretty box by her bed.\nThe mother  _  each of her little girl's letters, too. As the years went by, that little girl  _  into a young lady and then got married and started a  _  of her own. For the first time, the jar sat  _  . The mother dusted the jar every day and sometimes looked inside,  _  sadly that the magic jar years had to end.\nOne day the young lady came to  _  her mother. She went straight to her mother's room, opened the chest at the end of her bed, and found what she was looking for. She  _  a piece of paper and put it in the jar, and  _  it to her mother. The mother opened the magic jar and there was that note from so long ago, \"You're going to be a  _  !\"\nAnd when that baby boy was born months later, there was the jar  _  in his nursery  with a blue ribbon tied around it, and a note that read, \"Magic jar years never  _  : they are always just beginning.\"",
