    "article": "One cold rainy evening last October, as a medical student, I was in a hospital, gathering data for my graduation paper. Holding a patient questionnaire  made up of  some simple yes-or-no questions, I walked towards a 43-year-old patient who lay in bed alone. I was worried whether she would approve of my demands at such a late hour.  _  , she treated it with consideration. Soon I finished and prepared to leave.  _  I could stand up, she spoke up in a weak voice asking where I was from and why I was working so late in the evening. Then she started talking about herself as well as her  _  , \"My husband died about a year ago,  _  me the only breadwinner of my family. My pay as a cleaner is  _  enough for me and my three kids. I don't know what my children would be if something bad happened to me.\" I didn't know what to say. I desperately tried to remember the lessons from a communication skills class I had taken years earlier, but my mind was  _  . Without realizing it, I had begun  _  her hand. Now that I didn't have anything to say, I just sat quietly while she talked. That's when it occurred to me that she was not expecting any  _  from me. She  _  wanted me to listen. All 1 did was nod my head as a way of showing my  _  . The conversation went on for about 20 minutes. Finally, she stopped talking. \"I'm very sorry for keeping you here to listen to my problems, but I feel  _  now. I had no one to  _  out my problems to. Thank you so much, doctor.\" Sometimes patients do not need expensive medicine or advanced technology.  _  , they just need someone with the  _  to lend an ear and spare a little of their time. For me, that is one of the best things a doctor can do for a patient, doesn't it?",
