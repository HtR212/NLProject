In the last ten years, five or six novels have been  _  into Hollywood films, while her books continue to be bestsellers. So why is Austen still  _  ?\nRichard Jenkyns, a professor of English at Oxford University argued that her novels still  appeal to  people because they  focus on  the same issues today as they were when she wrote them.\nHer novels are about women  _  to find a perfect husband, but also  _  issues surrounding marriages, friendships and the family. \"The plots are fairly timeless about human interaction  _  are familiar to us,\" Jenkyns says.\nThe most famous book Austen wrote isPride and Prejudice,a  _  story between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. At first the two  _  do not get on. They  _  fall in love, but still have to  _  opposition to their relationship from their families.\nAll of Austen's books are  _  to read, making them popular with children and adults,\n  _  they work on different levels so people can take  _  they need from them, author Kate Henry says.\n\"You can choose to see the politics and feminism  in them,  but if  you don't want to take on those issues you can turn a blind eye to it,\" she says.\n  _  is often hailed  as the greatest romance writer in the English language, so it is surprising she remained  _  . \"Maybe she was too much of a romantic, waiting for a  _  \nman,\" Henry says.",
