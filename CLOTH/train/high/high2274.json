    "article": "We were on our way home from Houston one Saturday morning. We decided to   _   at a local gas station to get something to drink   _   all of us were thirsty.\n              When we were   _   and got back to our car, we noticed a man   _   outside the building. You could tell that he was a   _   man. His clothes were worn and it looked like he had gone in and got himself something   _   to drink since it was cold outside. He must have not had enough money to get something to   _  . That is not something I   _   very well, because that is not what \"  _  \"me.\n              Then a dog walked up. Being a dog lover, I could tell she had been   _   puppies  . She was terribly in need of something to eat and I felt so   _   for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her puppies would not   _   it.\n              My wife and I sat there and   looked at   her. We noticed that people walked by and didn't even pet     _  . She might not have been as pretty and clean as most, but she still   _   better. We still did not do anything. But someone did. The homeless man, who I   _   did not buy himself anything to eat, went back into the store. And what he did brought   _   to us. With the only money he may have had, he bought a can of dog food and fed that dog.\n              This   _   plays a great part in my life. That was Mother's Day weekend. And lots of people forget that some animals are   _   too. A homeless man made me a   _   man that day. He showed me what I should have done.",
