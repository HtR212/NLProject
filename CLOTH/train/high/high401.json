    "article": "It was the last day of final examination in an Eastern university. On the steps of one building, a group of engineering seniors gathered for the   _   due to begin in a few minutes. On their faces was   _  . This was their last exam -- then on to graduation and jobs. \nSome   _   of jobs they already had; others talked of jobs they would get. With all this assurance of four years of   _  , they felt ready and able to   _   the world.  \nThe approaching exam, they   _  , would be a piece of cake. The professor had said they could   _   any books or notes they wanted. Requesting only that they   _   not talk to each other during the test. \nHappily they entered the classroom. The professor   handed out   the papers. And smiles broadened as the students noted there were only five essay-type questions. \nThree hours   _  . Then the professor began to collect papers. The students   no longer  looked confident. On their faces was a   _   expression. Papers in hand, no one spoke as the   _   faced the class. \nHe examined the worried faces before him, and then asked: \"How many completed all five questions?\" Not a   _   was raised. He asked again, \"How many answered four?\" Still no hands.\nThen the students   _   restlessly in their seats. \"One, then? Certainly somebody finished one,\" he said. But the class remained   _  . The professor put down the papers. \"That is exactly what I expected,\" he said. \n\"I   _   want to impress on you that, even though you have completed four years of engineering, there are still many things about the subject you don't know. These   _   you could not answer are  ly common in everyday practice.\" Then, smiling, he added: \"You will all pass this course, 44 _  remember -- you are now college graduates, your education had just begun.\"  \nThe years have obscured (......) the name of this professor, but not the   _   he taught.",
