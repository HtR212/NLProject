Little did we know the effect our  _  early would have on someone else.\nWe set off at around 1p.m. and 33 went through a small town called Marsing. About 10 miles on the other side of Marsing, we saw thick34 _ miles down the road to where we were 35 _  We speeded up to see what was happening, and 36 _  a Big Rig (18-wheeled truck) on fire and the driver was sitting 37 _  on the side of the road. We walked out of the car and went to offer 38 _ .\nWe39 _ went to the driver, Basan, who was an owner-operator of the truck, to see if we could help. He had a serious burn on his left hand and shoulder. We40 _ him down, brought our towels to cover his hand and some 41 _ to keep it wet for him. Then we put him in our car and kept him there42 until emergency vehicles   arrived an hour later. \nBasan told us his engine 43 _ , and as he stopped the truck to cool it off, it just went up to flames. He managed to get his wallet, his cell phone and a fire extinguisher  out to44 _ the fire, but he couldn't control the flames and the truck   _   burned to the ground. Basan, though feeling terrible about what had happened, was very   _   to be alive and that someone stayed with him and helped him.\nWe happened to be there and could help him, because we decided to leave early. Was it a(n)47 _ ? Perhaps. But we believe that something just happen for reasons   _   our understanding at the time. We also believe that sometimes, challenges or opportunities49 _ our way because we need to help others. This experience was50 _ one of those occasions for us.",
