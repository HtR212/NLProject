Growing up in a poor family with uneducated parents, I was not good at my study. But a teacher changed my life. Without her, I couldn t have  _  so much in my later career. I can still remember the very important day that has  _  my whole life. I did so  _  Then the  _  day came. My father was asked to come to school to  _  with my teacher, Ms King. You can t imagine how angry and  _  my father was when he heard about my \"excellent achievement\". He  _  at me:\"since you can t even count from 'ONE 'to 'TEN', what are you able to be when you  _  up? Now, tell me!\"I was scared and  _  and didn t know what to say and tears came immediately into my eyes. Then the most unforgettable time in my life came. \"Maybe he can be a boxing refereeone day. That  _  only needs him to count from 'ONE' to 'NINE', which may  _  him well.\" Ms King looked into my eyes and firmly said. Now, I am in my forties, and can you believe it that thanks to Ms King, I am really a well-known boxing  _  of WBO(World Boxing Organization),and that I do need to count only from \"ONE\" to \"NINE\"? So are still worried about your poor grades at school? Remember there will always be a place waiting for you!",
