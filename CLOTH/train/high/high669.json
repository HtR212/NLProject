I hadn't even  _  and she thought it would be easier to run twice than try to communicate with me through our language  _  . Another time, I was looking for and  _  off in the name of looking at this and that. Out came a  _  from a small cafe and she at once knew I was  _  . She took me by the hand and asked where I was heading for. Then she  _  me to the fountain and three minutes later, I was standing in front of the masterpiece.

She accepted my  _  and a couple of stops later, I found myself  _  again, right next to her. We  _  , she in Italian and me in English. When she  _  my husband and I were heading for Tivoli, she took out her return  _  for the expensive inter-city bus and put them into my hand.
