    "article": "I looked up at the signs, trying to make sure which train I needed to take to Narita Airport. So I could catch the flight that would take me home to Canada. I was feeling the  _  of my huge pack, which contained gifts for my family. The Japanese language was  _  to me. You could imagine how hopeless I felt when I failed to see any symbol that  _  familiar. Just then, a woman stopped and asked in  _  which way I wanted to go. She helped me  find out  the platform number, the price and the time of departure. I thanked her. Having ten minutes left, she  _  I join her for a quick tea. She told me she was born in Japan,  _  spending a year backpacking in New York had let her experience the life of a woman  _  alone. We excitedly traded stories but soon our  _  chat was over. Her train was leaving. Before leaving, she hurriedly  paid for  both our drinks. \"Save your money,\" she said. I stood up and pulled the load once more onto my back.  All of a sudden  , she reappeared with a square box  _  in white and red paper. She pushed the box into my  _  . It was warm. \"For the train. Goodbye.\" I had  _  these specially prepared boxed meals for sale in the stations. They looked delicious but they were  _  my budget. As I waited on the platform, my pack didn't feel  _  heavy as before. Though I had been given one more  _  to carry, I felt light-hearted with the taste of warm food, the  _  of my homecoming and the generosity of a Japanese woman I  _  ran into on the way. And I never even  _  her name when she introduced herself.",
