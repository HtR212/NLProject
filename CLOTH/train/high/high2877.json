    "article": "Family is the most important part of human life. There, we  grow up  and learn to show  _  like: love, fondness, responsibility and friendship. We  _  days like festivals or something like that. In our century the model of one-child family began to be fashionable.  _  there are many extended families, too, where grandmother, grandfather, uncles, aunts, nieces, daughters, sons etc. live under the same  _  .\nThat situation, when children live with their parents, has both advantages and disadvantages. Grandparents can help their  _  children with looking after and bringing up their grandchildren. Grandparents may read fairy tales, talk fascinating stories about the past,  _  cards or chess with one another, walk a dog, help in the  kitchen  ...\nIt is very good, when a family is full of love. Sometimes living together makes many serious  _  . Teenagers, who are very naughty and quarrel with each other and  _  unpleasant situations and atmosphere  at home. They often  listen to  loud or strong music,  _  annoys the elders.\nA lot of people nowadays rent even a small flat to save some  _  , which they lacked living with their parents.  For example  , mother-in-law can teach her daughter-in-law many necessary things, but  on condition that  she does not interfere with  her marriage affairs.\nI think that living together with family  _  be very enjoyable and cheerful, but only in case when we  have respect for  our elders and we look in the future.  Everyone  should be safe and feel comfortable in their home. It should be a place where we  _  and where we spend a lot of our leisure time.",
