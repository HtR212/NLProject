Immediately his face turned stone-cold, and he said, \"If you're old enough to ask, you're old enough to   _  .\" And we had to seek odd jobs about the neighborhood.\nHe didn't   _   his attitude as we grew into adulthood. There was a time when   _   of us had a car, so we had to ride a   _   whenever we came home. Though the bus stopped about two miles from home, Dad never met us,22 _  in bad weather. If someone   _   (and my brothers did a lot), he'd say in his   _   father-voice. \"That's what your legs are   _    !\"\nOne spring morning I was on the bus home from   _  . Tests and long hours in labs had   _   me exhausted. As other students were   _   at their stops. I looked silently out of the window. Finally, the bus came to a   _   at my destination, and I   stepped off  , carrying my suitcase to begin the long journey home.\nThe row of privet hedge  came into   _  , which lined the driveway that climbed the hill to our house. I stopped to put a book in the suitcase. When I stood up, I saw something gray   _   along the top of the hedge toward the house.\nIt was the top of my father's head. I 33 _  then, each time I came home, he would stand behind the hedge, watching,   _   he knew I had arrived safely. I held back my tears. He did care,  after all  .\nUpon reaching home, I found my father innocently in his chair. \"So! It's you!\" he said, his face lengthening into surprise.",
