Knowing that many kids often  ran into  trouble, he decided to do something about it. So in 1991 he began to invite small groups of kids to go fishing with him on his day  _  .\nThose fun trips had a(n)  _  impact. A chance encounter in 2000 proved that. One day,  _  working security at a school basketball game, John noticed two young guys  _  . He sensed trouble between them.  _  one of them headed toward John and gave him a hug. \"I  _  you. You took me  _  when I was in fifth grade. That was one of the  _  days of my life .\"\nDeeply touched by the boy's words, John decided to create a foundation that  _  teenagers to the basics of fishing in camping programs. \"As a policeman, I saw  _  there was violence, drugs were always behind it. They have a damaging  _  on the kids,\" says John.\nBy turning kids on to fishing, he  _  to present an alternative way of life. \"When you're sitting there waiting for a  _  ,\"he says, \"you can't help but talk to each other, and such  _  can be pretty deep.\"\n\"Talking about drugs helped prepare me for the peer pressures in high school,\" says Michelle, 17, who  participated in  the first program. \"And I was able to help my little brother  _  drugs.\"\nJohn faces  _  in three years, when he hopes to run the foundation full-time.\"I'm living a happy life and I have a responsibility to my  _  to give back,\" John says. \"If I teach a kid to fish today, he can teach his brother to fish tomorrow.\"",
