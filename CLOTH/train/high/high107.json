If you love books as much as I do, then I'm certain you must.\nMy library card has a(n)  _  place in my wallet, and some of my favorite  _  of childhood come from  _  the public library in my hometown. It is a(n)  _  house, much like the one introduced in Secrets of the Blue Hill Library, coming this summer.\nThe children's section  of our library is on the lower level, and I felt  _  when I walked down the steps, opened the small door (just right for a child) and entered the room with many rows of shelves. It was  _  a wonderland where new adventures   and friends awaited .\nI clearly  _  the pleasant smell of books -- a mix of new and  _  smell -- that attracted me deeply, and, like a bee moving from flower to flower, I  picked up  book after book as I took in varieties of  _  on those shelves and tried to choose the next ones I would take home. I preferred to read books about real-life heroes, whose lives  _  me a lot. From the books on our library shelves, the world was opened to me in an attractive way.\n  _  , of course, my reading took me up the steps and into the  _  library on the first and second floors, where I continued reading every book with much  _  . To be honest, I can't  _  how different my life would have been if it had not been for the variety of reading I  _  at the library.  _  I can say for certain that,  _  its strong and comforting presence in my  _  life, I would not be the person I am today -- a successful writer.\nIn the book Secrets of the Blue Hill Library, the people of this small town have no  _  . But two wonderful women come together to provide both a nice library for the town and a home for Anne, the leading character. But that is only the beginning of the adventures that await Anne--and you as my fellow library lover.",
