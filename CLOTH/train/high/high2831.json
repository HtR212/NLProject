    "article": "One day I was riding on a crowded bus downtown to go to work when it rained suddenly. The windows of the bus were soon   _    and we couldn't see the outside. Everyone was in low spirits. I was sitting next to a man in a business suit and I paid little attention   _    we both got off at the same stop and walked to the same news-stand  to get a morning   _   .\nThe man     _    the stand was obviously having a bad day. He was    _    and unsmil!ing as we bought our papers, which only    _   more gloom   to my day. The business!man     _    my eyes and smiled brightly,    _    the news-stand owner for the paper and for being open on such a morning to   make sure   we were able to get our papers.\nAs we went away, I asked this man why he was so    _    to the newsman when he didn't respond to his    _   of thanks and friendliness.The businessman smiled at me and said, \"Why would I let someone else   _    what I say and what I feel?\"\nWe then    _   to go to our own work places. To this day, I still don't know who that businessman was, or where he worked.    _   , I know nothing about him. He appeared briefly in my life and disappeared just as   _    . But I've never forgotten the words he said and his     _     which seemed like a ray of light on a gloomy day.\nThat was a good 25 years     _    , but the effect this had on my life has lasted. I have learnt that we cannot control people and     _    we are in, but we can always control our  _   to them. That is, it is within our control and our     _   to make such positive decisions and thus to make a positive difference.",
