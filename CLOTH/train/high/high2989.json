There was a time when Ryan was not able to come to school.\nHe was in a great deal of  _  after\nhaving a surgery on his legs, but he  _  his\nsufferings from everyone.\n         In our junior year, we found that we didn't   _  a single\nclass. This was not a problem, though. We just talked a little more in the\nhallway  _  passing periods. That year seemed to\nfly by. One day, Ryan asked me to hold the torch   runner's flag that would   _  the spot where Ryan would  _  his Olympic torch run. He gently explained that he would be honored  _  I would accept this position for him. The Olympic committee sent a\nletter saying that the person that holds the flag for him must be someone  _  to him. He said I was the only true friend he had  _  made that talked to HIM and not to his wheel chair. How could I  _  such a request?\n         On the morning of June 5th, as I walked down the sidewalk, my heart   _  and my mind became a factory of questions. I kept wondering how\neverything was going to happen and how Ryan would  respond to  the\nhuge crowd of thousands of people.\nAfter the van arrived, the other runners got out and lined up outside the van, chanting his name, \"Ryan! Ryan!\" Then all of the people   _  in,\n\"Ryan! Ryan!\" The lift then lowered Ryan to the ground. There he was, in all\nhis  _  .\nIt all became slow motion at the sight of the arriving torch. The runner lit Ryan's torch and then Ryan began his   _  . As he took off down the street, the\nchanting became louder and louder. The  _  filled\nthe air and even I felt like I was on cloud number nine. I could not have been\nany prouder of Ryan! He   _  this moment in time --a historic\nmoment--a moment that he was a part of and  _  me\nto be a part of, too.\nMr. Weinheimer, the next torch runner, bent over and gave Ryan a hug. That moment will last in time forever. It symbolized the whole   _  of the\nflame: love, excitement, enthusiasm, brotherhood, and life of any man. The\nflame united us all and showed that love is really what makes this small world\ngo around after all.",
