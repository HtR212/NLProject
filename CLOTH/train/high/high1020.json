    "article": "Two years ago, Dubuque, Iowa, started its first annual \"Back to School Bash\" program. It offered needy families an opportunity to learn about free  _  in the community. Holmes decided to  _  by providing help to kids. He was  engaged in  two jobs at the time, one of which was working as a barber. Saturday was his  _  day, but he chose to  _  his time and gave free haircuts to lower class kids on condition that the kids should  _  their free haircut by having to read a book to him.\nThe idea was so  _  that he continued it for the next two years. Many kids would  pick up  a favorite book, settle into the barber chair, and read aloud  _  Holmes was doing their hair. After the haircut, they'd review the book, from the  _  and vocabulary to the themes--just like in school, only more fun.\nHolmes, who is married  _  two sons, recognizes that not every parent has the time to  _  with their kids. So he hopes to offer some  _  in this way. And he admits he,  _  , benefits from doing that.\nThere was a seven-year-old kid who  _  stuttered  over words while reading. He had the boy take the book home and  _  . When the child came back a few days later, he read it with no problems. That  _  Holmes to do more.\nHolmes and his family have recently moved to a Chicago suburb. When they get  _  , he plans to restart his  _  as the Storybook Barber. \"Today's world is full of guns and violence,\" he says, \"The barbershop is a  _  place for the kids to come and read books.\"",
