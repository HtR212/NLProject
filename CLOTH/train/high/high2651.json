He drove down the street and made the  _  towards our home. On one side of the road, an old man stood, drenched to the bone , with his hand  _  . The rain had been  _  heavily that day. My husband stopped, and asked him where he was  _  . He wanted to go about five miles past our home, but my husband still told him to  get in  . My husband chatted with him, drove  _  our house and took him home for his Christmas Eve.  _  turned out that this poor man was what we now  refer to  as a \"slow learner\" and the only job he could get to  _  him and his elderly mother was at the bakery near where my husband worked. He worked from 5 a.m. until 1 o'clock in the  _  . Not only that, but that poor man had been standing there trying to get a ride on Christmas Eve for about 5 hours  _  my husband picked him up.  No one  else would give him a ride because they didn't want to get their seats  _  . Over the years my husband  _  to give him a ride home whenever he saw him trying to get a ride. When he passed  _  , my husband went to his funeral.  _  my husband didn't know his family, they knew of him. Even his twin sister who  _  in the state of Washington knew who my husband was and everyone thanked him for his  _  toward one who had so little. An act of kindness can make another person's day, or even their life.",
