I will  _  play with her again!\" Finally, her steps slowed,  _  she told her father what had happened. He listened attentively.  _  she stopped, he asked, \"Is there  _  else?\" Dahlia added more details and began  _  bitterly again. Father was listening. When Dahlia  _  talking, he said, \"It must  _  you to be made fun of like this by your best friend Tina.\" Dahlia  _  her father's embrace and support as she cried  _  more in his arms. Then as  _  as the storm of tears began, she was finished. She got up and  _  announced, \"Daddy, did you know that tomorrow Tina and I are going together to the beach? We are  _  a log house there with Adam and Tom, I will tell Tina before we go that I  _  ruin her work again, and I'm sure she will be  _  to me. \" Why was this encounter (sudden meeting) so successful? How did Dahlia  get over  her sadness so completely and realize her responsibility in the matter  _  her own? There were three main parts in her father's reaction that  _  : (A) Attention (B) Respect (C) Trust. He gave his daughter  _  attention and took her seriously as she  poured out  her feelings. He respected her by not coming with words of wisdom, advice or help. He validated the feelings she  _  . And he trusted her to do and say what she needed in order to lead herself toward resolution of her emotions.",
