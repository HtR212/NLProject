    "article": "Half a year before graduation from college, my son began to seek a job.  Due to  the financial crisis, fewer companies would like to  _  new staff. My son targeted a company that was  _  to hire only one person  _  there were more than twenty people filling their resumes. After the interview, there would only be 3 who could enter the final round, which would later  _  one person to be employed. Everything seemed to go quite  _  and my son passed the first round and entered the final round in a week. On the day of the final interview, my son and other two  _  arrived at the interview place on time,  waiting for  the test. Unexpectedly, the interview was unbelievably  _  . The interviewer only said to them, \"All of you are very super. Please go home and wait for our  _  . We will tell you the  _  in 3 days. Good luck to all of you!\" On the morning of the third day, my son received a text from the company shortly after breakfast that he was not employed. We all felt very  _  . In nightfall that day, my son suddenly told me  _  on the phone, \"Dad, I have been employed!\" Greatly surprised, I could not wait to ask him, \"What's the whole  _  ?\" My son told me that he received another text saying that he was employed. Actually the first text sent to my son was also  _  of the test in the interview. Three men received the same text this morning and only my son's  _  was \"Thank you\" while the others said \"Goodbye\". Only then did I know that my son's \"hope\"  _  in that way. That is, when you feel disappointed, do not  _  to say \"thank you\" to the one who disappoints you. Saying \"thank you\" shows respect for others' work and shows your grand  _  . Therefore, while under the same condition, you will get the upper hand in terms of  _  compared with others!",
