    "article": "One winter during college in New York, I took an 8 am history class to fulfill a requirement. It was  _  to get up for that class, but every morning I would  _  the cold winds and went to the lecture. The professor for the class would step  _  into the room. He was terribly nervous about the class and always fixed his eyes on his book, never  looking up at  us. I felt that I needed to do something to  _  the boredom, so I tried to find something in his lecture to ask him,  _  me to pay attention rather than letting my eyes close. The first time  *  I raised my hand, he was surprised but was obviously  _  to have a question to answer. I continued to do this every day. The professor seemed to become a bit more  _  and some other students even joined in. In fact, his answers were always  _  . In this way, I learned quite a lot and realized the professor was indeed a/an  _  in his field. On the last day of class we  _  our books and headed out. The professor stepped directly in front of me, with obvious  _  , putting out his hand. He said, \"  _  you for making my class so interesting,\" shaking my hand and smiling. I was so  _  . To me, it had been a pleasant way to  _  the time in his lesson. I had no idea that my  _  had any effect on him or the others at all. That  _  has stayed with me for 30 years. I don't  _  the fact I learned in his class, but I'll never forget the professor who taught me a lesson about the  _  of acts of kindness, indeed or not.",
