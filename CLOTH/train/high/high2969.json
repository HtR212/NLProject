The door was shut from inside.The lock it had was missing ,  or rather  knocked off , just leaving a  _  for the principal. Though the principal had  _  badly behaved classes before , what appeared through the  _  was till a shock for him.It was a scene that was  _  seen in action films.But he knew what to do.He  _  go into the classroom , take hold of the  _  boy and punished him.This would be an example to the others. He took a deep breath and then  _  open the classroom door.He had been prepared for the scene that there should be a shock of  _  , but few treated him as an important  _  , and some even paid little attention to his existence. \" Silence ! \" he shouted at the top of his voice.This time it was really  _  .They stopped what they were doing and stared at him.Quickly he walked up to the  _  boy in the room , who he  _  had been playing an important part and also had been shouting at the others at the top of his voice.
