    "article": "There is a measurable relation between how much a person learns and that individual's attitude toward the subject to be learned. When  faced with  a difficult learning assignment, one  _  toward success is to seek out and concentrate on the positive aspects of the subject matter. If a student has a(n)  _  and ineffective teacher in a required course, one  _  is to look for the positive aspects of completing the course, regardless of how boring the instructor happens to be. To  _  this might require a private tutor or some  _  reading, but with the right  _  , success is possible.\n  _  --those students who do better than their test scores--  _  have a positive interest toward learning. They may learn some things more slowly, and it may take more effort, but, to compensate, they are often better at  _  what they have learned. As long as they do not stress themselves into  _  problems, they are successful.\nUnder-achievers--those who function  _  their ability indicated by test scores--often tend to permit a few  _  factors to sidetrack them. Because of their negative attitudes, they sometimes become unfairly  _  f teachers. They allow themselves to get bored when it is not necessary.  In short  , their attitudes often cause them to learn less than overachievers.\nIf you learn to  _  a negative mind with a positive one--set toward learning with something more positive, you are on the road to  _  virtually any goal you desire. For example, if you realize a personal computer with a word processor would improve your  _  , but have an attitude that keeps telling you that you cannot learn to operate a computer you tend to make all kinds of  _  . In short, you resist making full use of a terrific tool,  _  because your negative attitude prevents you from learning.",
