    "article": "My grandfather dug water wells in Indiana and started his business during the great depression.\nAlthough nearly everyone was out of work, people still needed  _  , so he didn't lack jobs.  _  , in those days, it was awfully hard to get paid for what you did. One morning, a farmer showed up with a  _  --a whole side of fresh beef on his shoulder. \"I  _  this ought to make us equal on that digging,\"he said to my grandfather. Grandfather  _  .\nIt was wintertime, so the beef stayed fresh under damp cloth on the cold back porch . Each day, Nana stepped out onto the porch,  _  good piece of the meat, and carried it into the kitchen  as if  it were pure gold.\nAfter a few days. Nana noticed the  _  had been moved.She asked grandfather if he had touched the beef. He hadn't. \"Well, then. \"she said. \"somebody's been eating our meat. Do you always lock the back door?\" My grandfather told her not to  _  . She probably had moved the cloth herself, and had  _  forgotten.\nThis  went on  for many days. Nana was  _  that someone was taking their meat, and grandfather just insisted she was  _  things. It wasn't until much later that we learned the real story.\nOn the morning after grandfather set the meat out on the back porch door, he  _  some footprints near the door. He  _  followed the footprints to where they began. Soon the footprintsin the snow led my grandfather to a house he instantly  _  .It was the home of a poor single mother with two young children. Grandfather  _  turned around and walked back home. He didn't say a word about it to anyone.\nFrom then on, Nana would carefully  _  the lock on the porch door each night to make sure it was  _  . Then grandfather, after waiting for Nana to go to bed, would return to the porch and  _  the lock again. Nana never knew about the family they were helping to feed that winter.",
