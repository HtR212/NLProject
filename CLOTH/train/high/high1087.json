    "article": "I recently heard a story about a famous scientist who had made several very important medical breakthroughs . He was being interviewed by a reporter who asked him  _  he thought he was able to be so much more  _  than the average person. He responded that it all came from a(n)  _  with his mother that occurred when he was about 2. He had been trying to  _  milk from the fridge when he  _  the slippery bottle, its contents running all over the kitchen floor. When his mother came in,  instead of  shouting at him or giving him a lecture, she said, \"Robert, what a great and wonderful  _  you have made! I have  _  seen such a huge pool of milk. Well, the damage has already been  _  . Would you like to get down and  _  in the milk for a few minutes before we clean it up?\" Indeed, he did. After a few minutes, his mother said, \"Robert, whenever you make a mess like this, eventually you have to restore everything to its proper order. So, how would you like to do that? We could use a sponge , a towel or a mop. Which do you prefer?\" He chose the sponge. His mother then said, \" You know, what we have here is a  _  experiment in how to effectively carry a big milk bottle with two  _  hands. Let's go out in the back yard and fill the bottle with water and see if you can  make it  .\" The little boy learned that if he  _  the bottle at the top near the lip with both hands, he could carry it without dropping it. What a wonderful  _  ! This scientist then said that it was at that moment that he knew he didn't need to be  _  to make mistakes. Instead, he learned that mistakes were just  _  for learning something new, which is,  after all  , what scientific experiments are all about. Even if the experiment \"doesn't  _  ,\" we usually learn something  _  from it.",
