Most of the kids go there to swim, and there are plenty of rocks for them to use as safe harbors, so I had no   _   for his safety.\n  _   ,the fireman's first words \"You need to come up here to the Stillwater River\" made me catch my    _   ,and his following words gave me relief, \"Your son is OK.\"\nWhen I got to the river, I   _  saw the fire truck, ambulance and Eric, wrapped with a towel about his shoulders, sitting    _    On a low platform of the fire engine.\nI hurried over to him. \"You OK?\"I asked.\n Yeah,\" was all he said. But my eyes begged for a(n)    _   .I didn't get it from my son.\nThe    _   was this: A woman was being  _   under water. Hearing the cries, Eric and his friend Tyler, without    _   ,swam out to her, and brought her safely to shore.\nIn an age in which the word\"   _  \"is broadcast with abandon and seemingly applied to anyone who make it through the day ,I realized the    _    thing in my son. The teens are   _    and self-centered, but that didn't     _   they have no desire to do good.\nStill shocked by my son's   _   ,I drove him home. Along the way, I tried to   dig out   some more information from him-but he had very little to say.  The   _   words he said were, \"What's for supper?\"\nI spent some time alone that evening,   _    about the terrible result that might have been.  The next morning, when Eric got up, I half   _   him to tell me the story.  But all he did was toast some bread, pull himself together, and head for the door to start a(n)   _    day. Watching from the window, I was reminded that    _    water often runs deep.",
