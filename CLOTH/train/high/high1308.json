    "article": "Louis Braille was born in the small village of Coupvray in France. His father was a skilled leather worker who had many  _  tools. One day, when his father went out, three-year-old Louis  picked up  a sharp and pointed awl   from his father's tool-box. The awl slipped from his tiny hands and hurt one of his  _  . The infection soon spread to the other eye and the poor child became totally  _  at the age of three.\nHe had a great goal and dream in his life. At the age of 12 he started his new mission -- to  _  a system to enable the blind to read and write. He had the concept that if the letters could be  _  by the fingertips even the blind could  _  with ease. He successfully completed his system of  _  dots by the age of fifteen. The system invented by Louis Braille has a series of raised dots. Each letter is formed by raised  _  dots out of a total of six dots arranged in a rectangle   consisting of two columns of three dots each. Braille's work has changed the lives of millions of disabled people and enabled them to lead a  _  life.\nThe  _  contributions of Braille provided a vision and mission for the millions of disabled people. By  _  and effort, they also can create wonders and serve society.",
