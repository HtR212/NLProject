Others succeed because of them. The  _  is that our problems help to make us what we are. Those who  _  often learn the value of sympathy. And those who  fall down  often teach others how to rise again. Our troubles can  _  us in ways a carefree existence cannot.\nA  _  is told about an Eastern village that through the centuries was known for its good pottery . Especially  _  were its pots, high as tables, wide as chairs; they were  _  around the globe for their strong form and great beauty.\nLegend has it that when each pot was seemingly  _  , there was still one final step. The craftsman  _  it---and then put it back together with gold filigree . A(n)  _  pot was then transformed into a priceless work of art. What seemed finished wasn't until it was broken.\nSo it is with  _  ! Broken by hardships, disappointments and tragedies, they can become  _  and bitter.  _  when mended by a hand of patience and love, the finished  _  will be a work of beauty; a life could  _  reach its wholeness after it was broken.\nIf you feel broken,  _  that you are a work of art!
