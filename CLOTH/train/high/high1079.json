Then he gave us a creative writing   _  based on one of those thoughts.\nAt 17, I was beginning to   _  about many things, so I   _  the statement, \"I wonder why things are the   _  they are?\" That night, I wrote down in the form of a   _   all the questions that   _  me about life. I realized that many of them were   _  to answer, and perhaps others could not be23 _  at all.\nWhen I turned in my paper, I was   _   that I might fail the assignment because I had not    _   the question, \"I wonder why things are the way they are?\" I had no answers. I had   _   written questions. \nThe next day Mr. Reynolds called me to the   _  of the class and asked me to   _    my story for other   _  . He handed me30 _  paper and sat down in the back of the room. The class became   _   as I began to read my story:\nMommie, Daddy...  _  ?\nMommie, why are the roses red?\nMommie, why is the grass green and the sky blue?\nAt the   _  of my story, my eyes locked with Mr. Reynold's eyes, and I saw tears slowly sliding down his cheek. It was then that I   _   that life is not always   _   on the answers we receive, but also on the questions that we ask.",
