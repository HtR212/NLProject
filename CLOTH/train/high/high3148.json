    "article": "Tales of the supernatural are common in all parts of Britain. In particular, there was (and perhaps still is) a belief in fairies . Not all of these  _  are the friendly, people-loving characters that appear in Disney films, and in some folktales they are  _  and cause much human suffering. This is true in the tales about the Changeling. These tell the story of a mother whose baby grows  _  and pale and has changed so much that it is almost  _  to the parents. It was then  _  that the fairies had come and stolen the baby away and  _  the human baby with a fairy Changeling. There were many ways to prevent this from happening: hanging a knife over the baby's head while he slept or covering him with some of his father's clothes were just two of the recommended  _  . However, hope was not lost even if the baby had been  _  . In those cases there was often a way to get the  _  baby back. You could  _  the Changeling on the fire--then it would rise up the chimney, and you would hear the sound of fairies' laughter and soon after you would find your own child safe and sound nearby.",
