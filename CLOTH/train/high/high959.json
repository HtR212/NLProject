As little kids do, we all began to race to our  _  .The girls took the concrete stairs  _  the boys ran straight up the grassy hill, at the top of which sat a long wooden fence .  Without  fear the boys ahead of me vaulted over the fence bravely.\nWhat should I do? Take the stairs and look like a girl, or jump the fence and look  _  ? Then I took my chances with the  _  .\nStanding in front of the fence, I placed both hands on the top and  _  .The moment of truth had arrived. If I made it, then I would be as cool as all the other guys. If I didn't make it...I  didn't make  it. As I jumped, my foot caught on the top of the fence.  _  I went! But I landed on my backside.  _  to laugh off the accident. But then I  _  something moving under me. Just then I saw what seemed like hundreds of bees flying towards me. I had  landed on  a beehive ! I jumped and  _  as fast as I could. But bees flew faster than I ran. At that moment, all the kids at the camp ran after me, too.

Bees flew out of my clothes and  _  out of my mouth!\nI had gained the  _  of the entire camp, but I did not feel very cool. When all was said and done, I found that I had been given almost 45 bee stings all over my body. I learned a most  _  lesson that day.
