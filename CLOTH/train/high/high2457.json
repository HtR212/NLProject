    "article": "A beggar, carrying a shabby old wallet, was begging alone from house to house. As he complained about his  _  , he kept wondering that people who lived in  _  houses should always be unsatisfied,  _  rich they might be, and they should go so far as to  _  all they have. \"Here, for example,\" he said, the former master of this house succeeded in trading, and made himself very rich. By then, instead of stopping, and handing over his  _  to another, and spending the rest of his years  _  peace, he took to equipping ships. He expected to get mountains of gold; but the ships were  _  , and his treasures were lost. Now they all lie at the bottom of the sea, and he has found his  _  disappeared like those in dreams. In short, examples of this are  _  . At this moment Fortune suddenly appeared to the beggar and said, \"Listen! I have long wished to  _  you. Here are a lot of gold coins I have found. Hold out your wallet, and I will fill it with them; but only on this condition: All shall be gold that falls into the wallet, but if  _  of them falls out of the wallet to the ground, it  _  become dust. Consider this well. I have warned you I shall  _  keep my word. Your wallet is old, don't fill it  _  its power.\" The beggar was almost too overjoyed to breathe. He  _  felt the ground below his feet. A stream of coins were poured  _  it. The wallet soon became rather heavy. \"Is that  _  ?\" \"Not yet,\" \"Isn't it  _  ?\" \"Never fear.\" \"Consider, you are a millionaire.\" \"Just a little more, just  _  a handful,\" But at that moment the wallet broke, the gold coins  turned into  dust and Fortune disappeared. The beggar had nothing but his empty wallet and remained as poor as before.",
