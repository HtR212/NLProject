Understanding the difference between the two is the first step in learning how to cope with.\nThe first regards stress as coming from how you   _  your situation. For example, one day your boss emerges from a long, closed-door meeting   _   upset. Then she e-mails you requesting a meeting. Do you   _   think you'd be fired? If your mind starts spinning a disaster, it's enough to drive your body to a stress   _  . To cope with it, you may not be able to avoid the stir,  but  you can learn to change your response and  _  your mind. Start keeping a list of everything in your day that causes stress.
