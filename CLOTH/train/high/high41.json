    "article": "Our holidays were coming to an end but we had not yet realized our plan to drive to Dalat. Our  _  about Dalat with its shining cherry blossoms and scenic views were  _  us to start our journey. Then one morning our dream  came true  . We hired a car and drove  _  to Dalat early in the morning. Splendid landscapes  at dawn  on either side of the road  _  before us. The refreshing morning breeze was caressing our skin and in  _  spirits we were singing merrily. When we reached Blao Pass, we saw a white  _  in front of us. We  _  down the pass. It seemed to us that the young girl in the white car did not want to be  _  as she was driving at full speed. Suddenly she lost  _  of her car; it turned to the left and crashed into the slope and  _  . Quite frightened, we braked  _  and jumped out of our car. We turned her car over and pulled out the girl who was  _  in the car. The girl had narrowly escaped death. She was shivering like an aspen leaf. In spite of her  _  , she looked very beautiful, just like an angel. When she had  _  from her panic, she timidly thanked us for having rescued her, then she looked at her flat  _  in despair. Reading her thoughts, we took off our shirts and began to  _  the punctured tyre. We then put on the  _  wheel for her. As soon as the work had been done, we started our  _  again and followed Da Huong Lan--the girl we had helped.",
