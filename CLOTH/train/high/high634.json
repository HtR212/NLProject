They didn't look like much, but they  _  the man, so he took the bag out of the cave with him.As he walked along the beach, he  _  the clay balls one at a time out into the ocean as far as he could.He thought little about it  _  he dropped one of the clay balls and it cracked open on a rock.Inside was a beautiful, precious stone!  _  , the man started breaking open the  _  balls.Each contained a similar treasure.He found thousands of dollars'  _  of jewels in the 20 or so leftover ones. Then it  _  him.He'd been on the beach a long time, throwing maybe 50 or 60 of the balls, with their hidden treasure, into the  _  .Instead of thousands of dollars in treasure, he  _  have taken home tens of thousands but he had just thrown it away! It's like that  _  people.We look at someone, maybe even ourselves, but we  _  see the clay shell.It doesn't look like much from the  _  .It isn't always beautiful or shining, so we  _  it.We see that person as less important than someone more  _  or stylish or well known or wealthy.But we haven't taken the time to find the treasure  _  inside that person. There is a treasure in each and every one of us.If we take the time to get to know that person and ask God to show us that person the  _  he sees them, then the clay begins to  come off  and the brilliant jewel begins to shine forth.May we not come to the  _  of our lives and find out that we've thrown away a  _  in friendships because the gems were hidden in balls of clay! May we see the people in our world as God sees them.",
