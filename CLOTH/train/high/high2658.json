For most of us this was an important  _  ,\nbecause the small object that had come into  _  was a warship. Husbands, fathers, brothers and friends were coming home\nafter a(n)  _  of four years . We were  _  that the ship would arrive in about 10 minutes.\nWe cheered more  _  than ever.\nThe harbour had rarely  _  such\na colourful scene. It was decorated with flags and we were all wearing best\nsummer clothes. The time we waited seemed  _  ;\nbut little by little the  _  took\nthe  _  of a ship and, soon, it came\nso near that we could  make out  its name:\nCandia, on the ship.\nNow the crowd could hardly be  stopped  . People were jumping up and down, waving; and little boys  _  onto still cars to get a better view. As the ship came\ninto the harbour, everybody eagerly stared at the troops  _  along the fences. Soldiers  on board  waved\nto us wildly, shouting out the names of people they  _  or wanted to see. The two young men in the  _  with\na \"Welcome Home!\" banner  almost fell over in their  _  to\nlift it higher. Women were crying; others  _  ;\nand some did not quite know whether to laugh or cry. Now the troops were\ndirectly above us. Our excitement had  _  a\npeak, for soon they would come on shore.",
