    "article": "During a recent business trip there were no trains to the airport and many people were stranded and had to buy new tickets for flights and also arrange hotels for the night. I was traveling alone and like everyone else I had to  _  in very long queues. \nI had queued for about 30-40 minutes and was looking around  _  I saw a lady with a small child in her arms near the back of the queue. I knew she had at least  another  30-40 minutes to wait just to  _  my position and maybe 10 more minutes from there as I was quite close to the  _  of the queue. I could also see that she was quite  _  and the child was heavy and asleep on her shoulder.\nI  looked back  until I caught her attention. Once I got her attention I  _  her forward and asked the people who were  _  me if they minded if I  _  positions in the queue with this lady. So I let the lady into my position and went to the back of the queue myself.\nAt first she said  _  as I know she was very surprised by this gesture, but when she got to the front of the queue and had  _  her hotel she looked back and found me in the queue. Her  _  of relief and gratitude made the rest of my  _  very easy indeed as I felt very good for the little  _  I had made.\nWhat touched me too was that other people in the  _  close to me had seen what I did and  _  it was a nice thing to do. I hope I inspired in them the idea to do  _  things for others.\nBut I know I made that lady's day just a tiny bit  _  and allowed her to get her child to a bed sooner and that was  more than  enough for me.",
