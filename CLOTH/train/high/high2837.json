I have,\" she said. \"How was it?\" I said the words as  _  as I could to show my excitement, even though I sensed the answer was not going to be   _  . She sighed heavily, \"No one ever  _  on that bus. They all sit there quietly and look sad. I only see about thirteen  _  old ladies and men.\" My  _  for her situation grasped my stomach.\nMy dad had recently passed away, and his sudden leave made my mother  _  and frightened.

I knew she needed great  _  to make the decision to take the senior bus. However, I firmly believed the  _  wouldn't last too long, for Mom was so outgoing and active that she could chat with almost everybody whom she met in the street.\nSeveral days later, when I came to visit her, I asked, \"Do they talk to you now?\" She  _  and there was a sparkle   in her eyes.

She sowed tiny seeds of   _  for herself and her friends on the bus.",
