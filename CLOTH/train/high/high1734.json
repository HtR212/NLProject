    "article": "It was 20 years ago. I was driving home with my 4-year-old son. Traffic was light. I was singing quietly along  _  the song playing on the radio. I  pulled up  at the intersection and looked both ways. The road was  _  . I slowly started to make a right turn when suddenly a car rounded the curve at high speed and came  _  at me. I stomped on the brakes of my car killing the engine in the process. The speeder zoomed past my dead car  _  me by inches without even slowing down.  _  I knew it, a stream of rude words was flying from my lips,  _  after the car and its driver. I then saw my son who was staring up at me  _  . With a red face and a(an)  _  smile I started the car, pulled back onto the road, and headed home. Later that evening I was reading a book when I heard certain  _  words coming from my son's bedroom. He was replaying the  _  over and over in his mind. Too  _  I realized the  _  of those words that had flown from my lips in that moment of  _  . It took a lot of talks about good language and bad language with my son to undo the  _  of that incident. That  _  , however, did teach me just how strong words  _  be. It helped me to decide to stop swearing in my own life and to start using words uplifting and inspire instead. I slowly realized that language is a  _  from God and should be used to make our world better but not worse. I learned  _  that a few loving words can help a hurting heart, strengthen a  _  spirit, and lighten a heavy load. I pray then that all of your words today are full of love, joy, happiness, and light.",
