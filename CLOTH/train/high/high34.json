He has had it  for years  and as he is very  careful with  it, it still looks as good as new. \"That umbrella must have  _  you a great deal of money, Uncle.\" I said to him one day. \"No,\" he replied, \"  not a penny  \" \"Was it a present?\" I asked again. \"No,\" said he. \"Then how did you get it?\" I asked. \"Well,\" he answered, \"it is a strange true story. About ten years ago, I was walking along a quiet London street one evening  _  it suddenly rained. I had no raincoat and no umbrella. No buses ran through that street and there were no  _  in sight. As I was on my way to a party, I didn't want to get  _  . So I stood at a doorway and waited for the rain to stop. By and by it grew quite  _  .There wasn't a person around, and  _  it rained and rained.  At last  a young man came to the place where I was standing,  _  a large umbrella over his head.  _  I hoped he would  _  me to walk to the next corner with him in order that I could get a taxi, I stepped  out of  the dark doorway where I had been standing, and said: \"  Excuse me  , where are you going with that umbrella?\"  _  by my sudden appearance, the young man  _  the umbrella, which, I'm afraid, he had just stolen, ran away, and  _  into the darkness. I picked up the umbrella and continued my walk. I knew it would be  _  in this big city to try and discover the owner and so I've kept it  ever since  .\"",
