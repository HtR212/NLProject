I learned how to fly when I was six years old, and it was not a   _   experience at all!\nIt happened on the   _   in Belgium. I was happily building a sandcastle when a lady   came up  and began to talk with my parents. I   _   that they wouldn't talk long, because she had a huge horrible dog on a leash! It was   _   its owner by her feet, trying to get her to go. It seemed that even the owner was growing   _   with her dog's movements, as to my   _   , she turned to me and said, \"Would you like to walk my dog?\"\nME?  I was sure the dog would eat me whole in one bite. I   _   looked at my parents to see if they would rescue me, but they were paying no   _   to me.\nA second later it was firmly tied to my wrist and I had no choice but to   _   the dog. At first, it wasn't so   _   . The \"monster\" took its time, walking here and there. Then   all of a sudden   it took off like a rocket. My arm was nearly injured as I found myself being sent into the air.\nIn a few seconds, everyone on the beach was   _   at me as if I had become some kind of local attraction. I tried hard to   _   the sand with my feet.\nThen the dog   _  . And I fell onto the sand. The creature must have been   _   , because it was walking slowly back to   _   my parents and its owner were. When we finally got back, I noticed the looks of   _   on their faces. My parents said, \"What took you so   _   ? Little boys shouldn't wander away that far!\" And then I began to   _   loudly.\nIs it strange that I have grown up to be a person who likes cats more than dog?",
