I took my daughter's hand and  _  around. Suddenly there was a  pull on my hand and my  _  was being directed to the  shoe section. I let go of her hand and she  _  out to touch a pair of shiny black shoes.\n\"Buy me?\"\n\"Oh, Sweetie, they are tap shoes. You aren't learning tap dance.\"\n\"Buy me?\" she  _  .\n\"Well, let's try them on.\"\nShe sat on the floor and  _  her rain boots, and easily slid the new shoes on. A perfect  _  . When she stood up she heard \"click\". She took a step. Click, Click. Slowly recognition dawned, as she made the   _   between the shoes and her moving feet. Click , Click , Click.\n\"Buy me?\" with a  _  look in her eyes.\n\"Okay, take them off and put them in the bag.\"\nThe sun had come back out as we stepped out from our little side  _  . When we were near the car, Amara reached for the bag. I gave it to her wondering what  _  she was looking for. The shoes, of course.\nI helped her wear the shoes. Our next stop was the grocery store and these shoes were made to make noise,   _  on my little girl's feet. This could be   _  . Click, Click, Click -- people turned to look. Click, Click, Click. I could feel the   _   stares of the proper people who would never allow their daughters to wear tap shoes to the grocery store. I held up my head with  _  .The \"click, click, click\" was  _  to my ears.\nWhen Amara was a baby, we were told she would never walk or talk. It has  _  a lot of hard work and patience but she asked for the shoes and the \"click, click, click\"   _   she can walk. It doesn't matter  _  others think. They don't walk in your shoes.",
