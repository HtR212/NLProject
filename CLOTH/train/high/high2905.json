    "article": "One day last month after I received my salary, I went shopping with my little son.  _  in the crowded store, I had my money  _  and my whole salary was gone with it. I was so angry that I almost lost  _  of myself. What could I do? We were not very  _  . The money was really not a small sum for my family. It would  _  our life greatly. How could I tell my wife? I felt very sad and even  _  for losing the money when I got home. To make up for my  _  mistake, I gathered all my strength to give our house a thorough cleaning and then  _  a wonderful meal and cooked a special dish my wife loved to  _  her. When she came home, I  _  a smile to greet her. She was  _  to see the neat house and the  _  meal. We sat at the table and began to eat. I told my story  _  . She did not respond. It was as if she had not heard my words. \" I've  _  my salary,\" I murmured to her again. \" I see,\" she did not shout at me as I had  _  . She didn't lose her  _  . So I was afraid she was trying hard to  _  her anger. A moment later, my wife was still  _  and seemed to be enjoying her favorite dish. At last I could not help asking, \" I've lost my money. Why not shout at me?\" she  _  her eyes, looking at me and said, \" Oh, on the contrary, I am thinking about how to comfort you. It's the  _  who is to blame.\"",
