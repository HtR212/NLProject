So she continued to stay  _  .\n  Her parents were very worried about her for they  _  she'd never make friends. They\ntried everything they could to help her to be  _  , but it\ndidn't work.\n  When Abbie started the tenth grade, she  _  a youth group in her neighborhood,\nhoping to make friends. She met people who on the outside welcomed her,  _  on the inside just wished she would stay out of the  _  .\n  By Christmas Abbie was so  _  that she decided to commit suicide  and leave her parents a note in the mailbox. She opened the mailbox and found letters  _  there.\n  She pulled the letter out to  _  who they were from. To her  _  , she saw one for her. She  _  it;\nit was a card from one of the guys in the youth group.\nDear Abbie,\nI  _  to apologize for not talking to you earlier, but I have been going\nthrough a difficult time recently. I  _  we can become\nfriends and help each other.\n                                                              Sincerely your friend,\n                                                                 Michael Hill\nAbbie looked at the  _  over and over again. \"Become friends,\" she smiled, realizing that\nsomeone cared about her and wanted her  _  .\nShe turned around and went back to her house  _  .
