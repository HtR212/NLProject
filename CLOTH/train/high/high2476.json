    "article": "When l was about five years old, I lived with my family in Enterprise, Alabama.\nWhat makes Enterprise, Alabama especially memorable is a    _     monument they have in the middle of town. The monument is a    _   to the boll weevil ,which is a particularly ugly-looking creature.\nIt's probably the only monument in the world erected   43 in memory of  an insect. It certainly wasn't done because of its aesthetic value.     _   ,it was erected because of the damage the boll weevil caused to the    _    crops of the surrounding area!\nWhy did they     _    this pest? Well, had it not been for the boll weevil, the local economy would have    _    its unchangeable dependence on its one-crop, one-product economy. Until then,   _     depended entirely on cotton. When the boll weevil came, the\nfarmers and all the other businesses that were reliant on the cotton farmers were forced to   _  the need to diversify.\nIn the long    _    ,they saw that the boll weevil had, in fact, done them a favour by   _  their crops. No longer were their     _    a11 in one cotton basket. They    _   raising pigs, peanuts and other cash crops, and the entire area was    _     off for it.\nToo often, we see difficult times as something to     _   ,something only to endure. We usually don't see the benefit     _   much later at all. If we    look back at    the things in our lives that were the most      _  ,we have to     _    that there was value in it.\nRemember, it's not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that makes the   _     in the quality of our lives. I believe that everything that happens can be a lesson.",
