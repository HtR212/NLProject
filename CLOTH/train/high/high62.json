    "article": "I was listening to the radio while 1 was driving home from coaching basketball yesterday. I could tell right away that there was something  _  by the mood of the speaker. There had been a plane crash. What made the  _  even more tragic was that Bob Collins,the morning show man, was among those who had been killed. Throughout my 40-minute  _  , I listened as sincere love and affection from the audience  poured in  .The more I listened about how this man had influenced those around him, the more  _  I became. That was because I wanted to know  _  we as a culture, wait until somebody has passed away before we tell them how much they  _  to us? Why do we wait until it is too late before we  _  someone up after they have died? Yes,  _  memory after memory about someone's good  _  does help us cope with the sadness of losing someone special to us. But as we  _  remember this person, our words fall short of the ears that most need to hear  _  . Just once,  instead of  a gathering of death,1 would like to see a celebration of life,  _  stories are told, tears fall down,laughter rings out;and as the speaker  _  his or her loving tribute , the person they are  _  rises from the chair and gives them a  _  hug! Wouldn't that be  _  ! Life is too short to leave kind words  _  . How I wish that when the unavoidable funeral finally comes,we could say  _  with the knowledge that they knew exactly how people felt about them while they were here on earth.",
