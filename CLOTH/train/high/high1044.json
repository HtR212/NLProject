His favorite subject was  _  , because his hobby was traveling.\nTaylor liked children, and was always ready to have a(n)  _  with them, so they learned a lot from him  _  at the same time having fun.\nOne September, at the beginning of the term, he was having his first  _  in a new class. To  start with  , he decided to ask them some simple questions  so that  he could see how much they had already known. He found some of the students had  _  that he enjoyed telling jokes, and they were ready to have some fun with him.\n\"Where is Turkey?\" was the first question.\n\"Turkey? Sir,\" a boy answered, \"you'll find it on the  Christmas  dinner table every December.\"\n\"Very  _  , and it isn't a wrong answer,\" said Taylor with a smile, while the class  burst into  laughter.\n\"Do you really know where it is?\"\nThe boy  _  , in fact, know. \"Part of it is in Southeast Europe and part of it is in Asia, sir,\" he said.\n\"Good!\" said Taylor. The next few students also had funny answers  _  Taylor's questions.\nTaylor knew that there was a girl in the class who was  _  and always got the highest mark in the exams, so he turned to her and asked her, \"What is the  _  ?\"\n\"It's an imaginary line drawn  _  the earth that has an equal distance from the North Pole and from the South Pole, sir,\" the girl answered at once.\n\"Good!\" Taylor said, \"Very good.\" But he thought perhaps she had  _  it by heart, so he asked her another question to  _  whether he was right or not.\n\"Do you really know what that  _  ?\" he asked. \"Could you, for example, tie a knot   in the equator?\"\nThe class laughed, but she answered, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Oh, really?\" said Taylor, still with a smile.\n\"Yes, sir,\" the girl said, \"as the equator is not a(n)  _  line, you could tie an imaginary knot in it.\"\nThis time, Taylor  _  happily in the students' loud laughter.",
