    "article": "It was a beautiful, sunny day. I had just finished  _  my daughter to the airport to catch an early morning flight. My sons and I  _  went to a fast-food place for  _  before heading back home. After eating, we all got into the car and pulled out of the  parking lot  . The restaurant was at the very top of a hill. At the bottom of the hill was a  _  sign, so we found ourselves at the end of a  _  line of traffic waiting while the cars at the bottom turned onto the  _  road one at a time.\nAs I looked down to the bottom of the hill, my eyes saw an elderly man standing  _  the stop sign. His clothes were  _  and shabby  . He held a cardboard sign with the words \"  _  Help Please!\" written on it. My heart went out to him and I  _  myself in his situation. As car after car turned onto the main road without  _  for him, I reached for my wallet to look for whatever  _  was left in it. As I was pulling it out of my wallet,  _  , I saw a young woman walk up to him along the side of the road. She was carrying a bag full of  _  taken out from the restaurant I was just at. I watched as the old man  _  the young girl and smiled as she reached out her arms to give him a hug.\nSuddenly a  _  honk   from the car behind me made me realize that I hadn't been  _  forward because this simple choice for  _  had captured (attracted) my attention and my heart. By the time I reached the  _  of the hill, both the man and the lady who had helped him were gone. Yet, as I drove home, the sun seemed to shine even brighter and Heaven felt a bit closer to Earth.",
