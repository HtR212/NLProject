    "article": "I have a friend named Monty Roberts who owns a horse ranch  . The last time I was there he told me a story about   himself  .\nHe was the son of a horse trainer who used to go from ranch to ranch, training horses. As a result, the boy's high school career was continually   _  . When he was a senior, he\nwas  _  to write a paper about what he wanted to\nbe and do when he  grew up  .\nHe wrote a seven-page   _  describing his goal of someday  _  a\nlarge horse ranch and handed it to his  _  . Two days\nlater he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a\nnote  _  , \"See me after class.\"\nMonty went to see the teacher and asked, \"  _  did I receive an F?\"\nThe teacher said, \"This is an unrealistic   dream for a young boy like you. There is no way you can ever do it. If you   _  this paper with a more\nrealistic goal I will reconsider your grade.\"\nThe boy went home and thought about it   _  and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said,\n\"Look, son, you have to  make up  your own mind on\nthis. However, I think it is a very important  _  for\nyou.\" Finally, after sitting with it for a week, the boy turned in the  _    paper. He stated, \"You can keep the F and I'll keep my   _  .\"\n\"The   _  part\nof the story is that two summers ago the same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to\ncamp out on my ranch for a week.\" Monty went on with the story, \"When the\nteacher was  _  he said, 'Monty, I can tell you\nthis now. When I was your teacher, I was  _  of a\ndream stealer. During those years I stole a lot of kids' dreams.  _  you had enough courage not to give up on yours.'\"\n\"Don't let anyone   _  your\ndreams. Follow your dream, no matter what happens,\" Monty added.",
