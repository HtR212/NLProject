She heard that the former teacher had  _  suddenly, but the headmaster didn't tell her  _  . All he told her was that this was a class of  \"  _   students\".\nFirst day, she walked into the classroom, spitballs    _  through the air, feet on desks, the noise deafening. She walked to the front of the classroom and  _  the attendance book . Next to 20 names on the list were IQ scores: 140,141...160. \"Oh,\" she thought to herself, \"  No wonder  they are so high-spirited. These children have exceptional IQs.\" She  _  and brought them to order,  _  that she could teach such high-quality students.\nAt first Maggie found the students  _  to turn in work, and that assignments that were handed in were done  _  , full of mistakes. She spoke to everyone, \" With your IQ, I  _  nothing short of (...) the best work from you.\"\nThe whole term Maggie continually  _  them of their responsibility to use all the extra intelligence God had given them. Things began to  _  . The children worked hard. Their work was creative and excellent. At the end of the term, the headmaster  _  Maggie into his office. \"What magic have you done to these kids?\" He asked  _  . \" Their work has surpassed   all the regular classes.\"\"It is just  _  . They're smarter than regular students! You said yourself they are special students.\" Maggie was  _  .\" I said they are special because they are the special need students--behavioral disordered.\"\"Then why are their IQs so  _  on the attendance sheet?\" Maggie pulled out the sheet and passed it to the headmaster.\" Those aren't their IQs. Those are their locker  _  at the gym. Sorry, Ms. Maggie, your kids are not geniuses .\"Maggie paused a bit, and smiled, \" If someone  _  himself to be a genius, he will become one. I'm teaching them as geniuses again next year.\"",
