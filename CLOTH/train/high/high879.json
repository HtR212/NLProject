For most of his life he was under   _  , so he made it his  _  task\nto not only match up to them, but to beat them as well. He started  _  his diet and lifting bags of hay   whenever he got the   _  .\nThis wasn't enough for him, though, because he knew the biggest elephant could\nthrow a(n)  _  that was five times the weight of\nhis.\n       He didn't   give up  . Finally there came a day on which he could\nthrow a whole tree trunk  through the air!! \"Now I've got to be the   _  elephant\nin town!!\" thought Herbert. He rushed over to all the other elephants and  _  started talking about his latest  _  . \"Oh\nboy, did you guys see that?! I  _  that tree\ntrunk all the way across the river!\" They all started  _  at\nhim, saying that they could all throw tree trunks three times that size and\ntwice the  _  .\n       Hanging his head   _  , Herbert wandered into the sunset. \"I try\nso hard, but it gets me nowhere.\" Just as he felt that it made no sense to\ncontinue his  _  life, he saw a rainbow in the\ndistance.\nThe birds singing in the trees, the tigers playing in the distance, and the warm wind made his soft   _  gently flap   like the way the leaves always   _  . \"Why haven't I noticed how  _  everything is, just the way it is?\" In that moment he realized the\nbeauty that  _  him and everyone and everything\naround him. As he  _  the other elephants he was\nnever again eager to  _  . He just wanted to feel the\ngentle wind touch his ears.",
