In an experiment that  _  healthy volunteers to a cold or flu virus, researchers found that people with a  _  sunny characteristic were less likely to  _  ill. The findings, published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, build on evidence that a \"positive emotional style\" can help  _  the common cold and other illnesses. Researchers believe the reasons may be both objective as in happiness increasing immune function and subjective as in happy people being less  _  by a scratchy throat or runny nose. \"People with a positive emotional style may have different immune  _  to the virus,\" explained the lead study author Dr Sheldon Cohen of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. \"And when they do get a cold, they may  _  their illness as being less severe.\" Cohen and his colleagues had found in a  _  study that happier people seemed less likely to catch a cold, but some questions remained as to whether the emotional tendency itself had the effect. For the new study, the researchers had 193 healthy adults with complete standard measures of personality tendency, health-consciousness and emotional \"style\". Those who  tended to  be happy, energetic and easy-going were judged as having a positive emotional style,  while  those who were often unhappy, tense and unfriendly had a negative style. The researchers gave them drops through their noses  _  either a cold virus or a particular flu virus. Over the next six days, the  _  reported on any aches, pains, sneezing they had, while the researchers collected  _  data, like daily mucus production. Cohen and his colleagues found that based on objective measures of nasal woes , happy people were less likely to develop a cold.",
