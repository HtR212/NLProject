Spreading kindness, one good deed at a time, is Karla Gibson's mission. \"I wish everyone could join me. There are so many   _   things going on in the world; I mean every day,\" said Karla.\nKarla had the   _   and sense of duty in December of 2013.The single mother of three said she tended to get down around the holidays, so she   _   to do something to cheer others up. She started a Facebook page and   _   her good deeds each day, from feeding the homeless to giving Easter gifts to the incarcerated  . She hoped to   _   others.\n\"We have to do something. Our   _   can make a difference in someone's day. You   _   know when someone might be having their worst day, and then something like buying them a coffee can change their whole attitude,\" Karla   _  .\nKarla's greatest   _   so far had to do with coffee. On September 27th, Karla's birthday, she went to her local Starbucks and gave the   _   $127 to pay for other people's drinks. She sat at the end of the drive-thru holding a   _   that read, \"Have a great day.\" She ended up   paying for   about 23 customers. \"It was really fun. It was   _   one of the best birthdays ever,\" she said. Her kindness that day didn't go   _  . One couple was so grateful that they surprised her with flowers and balloons to show their   _  .\nKarla's acts of kindness have become a   _   affair. Her two sons are always   _   others. \"Sometimes I'll ask Kyle, 'So, did you do anything extra nice today?' and he's like 'Somebody   _   something in the hallway and I picked it up' or 'I held the door for someone', that kind of thing,\" said Karla.\nIt's because of Mom that the boys think it's   _   to give a hand to others. \"I think it's a great idea of hers. It's always nice to help someone out   _   they really need it,\" said Karla's 15-year-old son Chad.",
