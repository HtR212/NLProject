I believe this is vital for their understanding of the world , their confidence, and the   _  of their morals and values. This doesn't mean kids need to be unnecessarily frightened or told more than they can  _   .\nMany people think they're protecting children when they spare them the truth. I   _  . I believe children   _  an enviable ability to cope with and  make sense of   what even adults find annoying ; they can accept the unacceptable in a way that  _   me. Kids also have an unusual sense when something is  _   . They know a fake smile when they see one, they realize when we're uneasy, and they can   _  when we're lying.\nOne night I was in the car with our two oldest daughters. It was dark and cozy--- the   _  time for a heart-to -heart conversation. One of our girls said, \"Mom, have you ever smoked cigarettes?\" I stalled  a little, but the girls   _  . They had me and they knew it .   _  I told them the truth. What happened next was an honest and direct  _   about the lure and danger of cigarettes, well worth any discomfort. I believe my honesty was much more   _  than warnings or platitudes .\nTime marches on, and so do   _  . While I've made mistakes as a parent, I do have clear and   _  relationships with each of our children. I believe my being truthful with our children has   paid off  , because I'm pretty sure that now they are honest with me.",
