    "article": "On Friday morning, I was waiting in the corridor with my class for the physics exam. Glancing back from the front of the queue, I found my best friend Terry, who was treating me like I didn't exist during the past two weeks,  _  all my calls and messages. With all the students seated in the exam room, Mr. Reed, our physics teacher, talked to the class and announced the exam. I hated physics and felt it hard to  concentrate on  my paper. I was just looking up when a  _  caught my eye. I could hardly believe it! Terry had her phone on her left knee and she was reading from it. Is that how Terry always got good  _  ? I almost put my hand up to tell the teacher, but what would everyone else think of her? However, it wasn't  _  ! So I nodded to Mr. Reed. He walked  _  down the row of tables. Terry was busy with her phone so that she didn't even find Mr. Reed had  _  her. She looked up from her phone with a frightened expression. Before she had a chance to explain, Mr. Reed took her  _  and told her to leave the room. Terry started crying as she walked to the door, looking back over her shoulder at me, sad and ashamed. After the exam, I received a text message from Terry, saying \"I'm really  _  that I've been avoiding you lately but it's been the hardest two weeks of my life. My dad has a heart attack and he's been in hospital. He has a(n)  _  today and I am really worried. I know it is stupid, but I was trying to send a text message to my mum to see how it was going. Then Mr. Reed caught me and thought I was  _  . I wish I'd told you what's been happening. I know I shouldn't  _  who my friends are. Will you forgive me?\" At these words, from my deep heart sprang up a burst of guilt along with the belief: Friendship is an honor and a gift, and worth the effort to treasure.",
