    "article": "Our teacher asks us to keep a diary in English. I enjoy doing so because I  _  keeping a diary in English is one of the effective ways to  _  our English writing ability. Compared with  other  forms of writing, it is shorter and  _  less time. It can help us to  _  the habit of thinking in English.  _  we persist in this practice, gradually we'll learn how to express ourselves in English. In keeping a diary in English,  _  can use the important phrases and sentences we've  _  in or out of English classes to describe our  _  , and this way we can master and use freely  _  we've learned, which will do good  _  us in English learning. But  at times  we certainly run up against many difficulties. In the first place, it often happens that we have  _  finding proper words and phrases to give expression to our mind. Secondly, there  _  many idiomatic ways of saying things in Chinese. And it is extremely hard for us to put them  _  English properly. As far as I am concerned, my suggestion is that we  _  always have a notebook and a Chinese-English dictionary within easy reach. Whenever  _  beats us, we can first put it down in our notebook and then look it up in our dictionary. We can also turn to our English teacher for  _  , if necessary. In short, I believe that it is of  _  use to keep a diary in English for the development of our  _  skills.",
