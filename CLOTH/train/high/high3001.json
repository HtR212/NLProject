    "article": "Directions: As we all know, Chinese handwriting has infinite power to express differences of character and cultivation. But we have to admit that traditional handwriting has become a  _  art, now that kids start using keyboards as soon as they begin school. However, writing things out by hand may be a  _  way we train our brains, several studies suggest. Many psychologists think that handwriting can make you  _  ! Writing by hand is different from  _  because it requires using strokes to create a letter,  rather than  just selecting the whole letter by touching a key, says Virginia Berninger, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington. These  _  movements activate large regions of the brain  _  in thinking, memory, and language. Handwriting helps children learn letters and shapes, improves their composition of ideas, and may also  _  fine-motor skills development. A study by Berninger found that in grades two, four, and six, children wrote more words, faster, and expressed more  _  when writing essays by hand than when typing on a keyboard. A separate study by researchers at Indiana University found that children who practiced printing by hand had more active  _  than kids who  _  looked at letters. It's not just children who  _  from writing things out by hand, says a study in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience. Adults learning a new language remember its  _  better if they write them out by hand than if they produce them with a keyboard. As more people  _  their days on the computer, says neuroscientist P. Murali Doraiswamy of Duke University, \"  _  people in handwriting skills could be a useful cognitive exercise.\"",
