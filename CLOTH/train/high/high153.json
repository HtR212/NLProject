Young people from working class backgrounds are  _  by studies with a clear job profile,,,and high income,  _  prestige and studies with a strong identity interest young people of parents with university degrees when choosing which studies to  _  . This is what researchers from the University of Copenhagen  _  in a new study. Students who have chosen to study medicine, architecture, economy and sociology often come from homes where the parents have  _  higher education, whereas business studies and pharmacy often  appeals to  young people with a working class background. This is  _  by a research team from the University of Copenhagen and Aalborg University in a new study. \"There is a  _  between the studies chosen by young Danes and their  _  background. Even for the young people who have very good grades in their A-level exams, and who could successfully  _  admission to a large variety of studies, the parents'  _  of education and social class play an important role in their choice,\" says Education Sociologist Jens Peter Thomsen, who is one of the researchers behind the study. The study \"The Educational Strategies of Danish University Students from Professional and Working-Class Backgrounds\" is  based on  60 interviews with Danish students from six different university level study programmes: Medicine, architecture, sociology, economy, pharmacy and business studies. The young people bring with them the  _  they get from their families. If you grow up in a home with parents who are doctors or architects with a strong professional  _  , it is an obvious choice to follow the  _  path as your parents when you grow up. \"For young people whose parents are university educated,  _  such as fame and mastery of expert knowledge are important. They are  _  by an educational culture in which you are a diligent student, and where leisure activities are  _  to the identity that lies within your studies. These young people have also grown up with  _  discussions around the dinner table which also prepare them for their lives as students,\" says Jens Peter Thomsen. He also added, \"Young people who come from a working class background, and have good grades have to  take advantage of  the full range of opportunities they have. But the effort to reach this goal must start early\".",
