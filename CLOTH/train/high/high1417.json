    "article": "(2013*)I had a bad habit of skipping to the last pages of a book.I just wanted to see how it ended  _  I was still in the middle of it. This habit  _  first my mom,then my friends, and  _  even my own daughter. Often my  _  wouldn't be limited just to the books I read but also to what others were  _  as well.Then one day my daughter told me in anger, \"Dad, please just read a book one  _  at a time like everyone else!\" At times I didn't  _  this bad habit to just books either.I also tried to skip ahead in my own life and  _  out what to do months and even years from now  instead of  enjoying each day at present. Although I knew that the  _  of my life wasn't done yet and that I had many pages  _  to go, I still couldn't control my burning desire to write the  _  of it halfway through.Time and again, I would  _  jump ahead and try to solve every potential problem before it happened. Life,  _  ,doesn't work like that.It loves to  _  us,and you never know what new problems, changes, or opportunities each new day will  _  . Recently when I found myself living in the  _  again,I felt a voice that gently told me I needed to \"live one day at a time\". When I heard those words, I  _  ,turned the book of my life back to the  _  page, and thanked God for today. Each of us has to  _  the book of life line by line,moment by moment and trust that our story will be brought to its perfect end.",
