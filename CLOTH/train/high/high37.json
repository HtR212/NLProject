So he raised a great  _  and made war on other countries. He conquered(,) many kings and  _  many cities. But at last his army was beaten; and Tamerlane escaped alone from the field of  _  . For a long time he wandered in  _  from place to place. His enemies were  looking for  him. He was about to lose all hope. One day he was  _  under a tree, thinking of his failure. He had now been a wanderer for twenty days. He couldn't  carry on  any longer. Suddenly he saw a small object climbing up the trunk of the tree. He looked more  _  and saw it was an ant,  _  as large as itself. There was a  _  \"You are  _  , Mr. Ant,\" he said, \"but you are carrying something that is too heavy for you.\" Just as he  _  , the ant lost its footing and fell to the ground. But it  _  held on to the grain of wheat. Tamerlane  _  the little insect. It tried the second time, the third time ... the twentieth time -- but always with the same  _  .

The next minute it climbed  _  into its home, carrying the grain of wheat. \"Well done!\" said Tamerlane, \"you've taught me a lesson. I, too, will try, try again,  _  I succeed.\" And this he did.",
