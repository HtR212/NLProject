    "article": "Dad is a reserved man of few words but is always strict. He is different from others in beliefs and     _   : beating or scolding his son as he believes in such a principle--a dutiful son is the    _   of the rod .\nAt about 8 years old, Dad busied himself outside in the day time     _   began to punish for whatever I did wrong after the supper. Mom and Sister took turns at telling on me for having made     _   , so he would beat me like    _    , leaving my arms a lot of bruises .\nI was upset and disturbed    in spite of     being just a 10-year-old kid, who thought, \"I was unfairly beaten, so I would take my anger out on other smaller kids\". Therefore, I used to     _     with other kids and Dad would deal me a     _    blow the next time.\nIt turned out that I couldn't concentrate on my lessons,     _    unable to write out the English alphabet. To make matters worse, I was    _    into a reformatory school  where I stayed    _     for two years. This time dad shed    _     tears, saying, \"Son, it is not that I don't love you but that I should not have been so annoyed at your failure to    live up to    what I expect!\"  \nSeveral years later, my parents were    _    invited to show up at the Ph.D. graduation ceremony. Dad didn't say a single word to    _    me but cried bitterly again , and at this very moment, my mind was in a mess of    _    emotions and I stood on the stage with warm tears: the first time you cried for my being a    _    guy, but this time you did for my being a Ph.D.\nNever have I put my children    _    by adopting force as I am aware that I was beaten into     _    inappropriately. I often say to my children, \"Well done! A perfect job you've done. Now Daddy will give you     _    up or pat you on the back!\"",
