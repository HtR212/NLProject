You never know  _  these people may be,possibly your roommate, neighbor, or even a complete stranger. But when you  _  eyes with them, you know at that very moment they will  _  your life in some way.\nAnd sometimes things happen to you that may seem  _  at first, 1but in reflection you find that without them you would have never  _  your potential ability.\nEverything happens for a  _  . Nothing happens by chance or  by means of  good luck. Illness, injury, love all occur to test the  _  of your soul. Without these small tests, life would be like a  _  road to nowhere. The people affecting your life, and the  _  and failure you experience, help to create who you are and who you become.  _  the bad experiences can be learned from, for they are  _  the most important ones. If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, because they are  _  you to love. If someone hurts you,  _  them, for they have helped you learn about  _  and the importance of being cautious.\nMake every day  _  . Appreciate every moment, for you may never be able to   _   it again. Tell yourself you are a great individual and  believe in  yourself. Create your own life and then go out and live it with absolutely no  _  . Most importantly, if you LOVE someone, tell him or her, for you never know what tomorrow may have in store.",
