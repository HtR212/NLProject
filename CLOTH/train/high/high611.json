    "article": "Driving along a busy Houston road, my two little girls became hungry at noon. They  _  no time in letting me know,  _  \"McDonald's, McDonald's.\" So I began searching for the  _  McDonald's. Suddenly I realized that almost every intersection   we passed through was  taken up  by a beggar. If my two little girls were hungry, then all these beggars must be hungry, too.\nAfter finding a McDonald's and  _  two Happy Meals for my girls, I ordered a(n)  _  15 lunches and set out to  _  them. Then, we stopped beside a beggar and gave him the lunch. After that, we  _  our way to the next intersection.\n  _  we came to the end of our \"route\", there was a  _  standing there, asking for change. We handed her our  _  lunch bag. \"No one has  _  done anything like this for me before,\" she said with  _  . I replied, \"Well, I'm glad that we were the  _  .\" Feeling uneasy, and wanting to move the conversation  _  , I asked, \"So, when do you think you'll eat your lunch?\"\nShe looked at me with her  _  brown eyes and said, \"I'm not going to eat this lunch. I have a little girl of my own at home and she just  _  McDonald's, but I can never buy it for her  _  I don't have the money. But you know tonight she is going to have McDonald's!\"\nSo many times I had  _  whether our acts of kindness were too small to make a difference. Yet at this moment, I recognized the  _  of Mother Teresa's words: \"We cannot do great things--only small things with great love.\"",
