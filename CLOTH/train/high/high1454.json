After all, the giver was Michael, my four-year-old son, who had   _   the distasteful item at his school's Christmas bazaar .\n\"I bought it for you Mama,\"he   _   yelled, offering it up to me, arms outstretched, face beaming, eyes big, blue and bright. At his young age, he had   _   way of knowing that this cheap-looking thing, was the antithesis of all I   _   about Christmas decor . And did I mention that it was ugly? Really, really ugly!\n\"We'll...put it...here...on...on the ...kitchen table,\"I   _   said.\nThe rest of the house was decorated with beautiful,   _   materials from the garden. And each year, I demonstrated unique and attractive ways to bring the outdoors   _   with creative decorating ideas.\nHow awkward and   out of place   my son's addition looked in the midst of all this natural beauty. He must have noticed my   _   with decorating and thought I would be pleased with such a gift.\nSoon my older children   _   through the back door, excited to relay the   _   of their day and display their precious purchases. Within   _  , the kitchen table was piled with crude snacks:\n\"Where are the rest of the things you bought?\"I turned and asked Michael,   _   he hadn't eaten the snacks at school or on the way home.\n\"I spent all my money on your present,\"he said proudly, not the least bit   _   by the chatter and delight floating in the air as the others   _   their booty .\nSuddenly, this ugly, boring gift took on a new   _  .\n\"You spent all your Christmas bazaar money on me?\"I asked, unconvinced that a four-year-old boy would   _   candy and cupcakes and things designed to   _   kids in order to buy a present for his mom. Ugliness   _   blossomed into beauty. I was delighted. No. Overjoyed. Wholeheartedly, I hugged both my son and his gift.",
