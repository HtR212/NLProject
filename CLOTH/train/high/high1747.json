Now I believe if you adopt an  _  attitude.you might just  _  enjoying it. Six months ago,my mom told me the club asked us to work as  _  at Saint Vincent de Paul Homeless shelter.That meant I had to  _  in the dirty homeless shelter for at least 20 hours. The first lime we went there,a lady led us to the kitchen where we  _  my five fellow Madcaps classmates- they also wore the same mark .Since I'm usually  _  awkward, I had never talked with any of them .Worse still,my mom was asked to help outside the kitchen,leaving me totally  _  to serve food with them. Soon large numbers of homeless families  _  in like rushing river.A little girl,around 5 years old,walked up to me I  _  her a sandwich. She took it and joined her family quickly.As she walked away, I  _  she was wearing a coat.Clearly too big for her, hanging  _  on her thin body, and couldn't help thinking how much I had  _  with her.It suddenly struck me that how  _  I am. After that moment I had a  _  of heart Now I love Madcaps and don't miss one meeting I have  _  awkwardness when communicating and have many friends. And this year I am sure I will do more than the  _  20 hours of charity. So that is how I have made a  _  by doing one thing I do not want to do .If you have an open  _  about things you can accomplish more and become a well-rounded person.",
