    "article": "One day I was shopping in a small town in southern California. It was my   _  to be approached by a clerk whose personality clashed   with mine. He seemed most   _  and not at all concerned about my intended purchase. I\nbought  _  , and marched\nangrily out of the store. My  _  toward\nthat clerk and the entire establishment increased with each step.\nOn the outside, standing by the parking lot, was a dark-skinned young man in his early twenties. His  _  brown eyes met and held mine, and in the next instant a\nbeautiful, broad smile  _  his face. My\nattention was immediately arrested. The  _  power of that smile removed all  _  within\nme, and I found the muscles in my own face  _  responding.\n\"Beautiful day, isn't it?\" I remarked, in passing. Then, obeying an impulse  , I  turned back  . \"I\nreally owe you a debt of gratitude  ,\" I said softly.\nHis smile deepened,   _  he made no attempt to answer. A Mexican woman and two men were\nstanding nearby. The woman  stepped forward  and eyed me\ninquiringly. \"Carlos, he does not speak English,\" she  _  . \"You want I should tell him something?\"\nIn that moment I felt  _  . Carlo's smile had made a big person of me. My friendliness\nand good  _  toward all mankind\nstood ten feet tall.\n\"Yes,\"my reply was sincere, \"Tell him what I said, 'Thank you!'\"\n         \"Thank you?\" The woman seemed slightly   _  .\nI gave her arm a friendly pat  _  I turned to leave. \"Just tell him that,\" I insisted. \"He'll\nunderstand. I am sure!\"\nOh, what a smile can  _  ! Although I have never seen that young man again, I shall\nnever forget the lesson he taught me that morning.  From that day on  , I became smile-conscious, and I practice the  _  diligently, anywhere and everywhere, with everybody.",
