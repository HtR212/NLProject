The same problem, on a smaller  _  , faces practically every company trying to  _  new products and create new jobs. There can be little prospect of raising the sort of sums needed from friends and people we know. While banks may agree to provide short-term finance, they are generally  _  to provide money on a permanent basis for long-term projects. So companies turn to public, inviting people to lend them money, or take a share in the business in  _  for a share in future profits. This they do by  _  stocks and shares in the business through the Stock Exchange. By doing so they can put into circulation the savings of  _  and organizations, both at home and overseas. When the saver needs his money back, he does not have to go to the company with whom he originally placed it.  Instead  , he sells his shares through a stockbroker to some other saver who is seeking to  _  his money. Many of the  _  needed both by industry and by each of us are provided by the government or by local authorities. Without hospitals, electricity, telephones, railways, this country could not  _  . All these require  _  spending on new equipment and new development if they are to serve us properly, requiring more money than is raised through taxes alone.

There is  _  a man or woman in this country whose job or whose standard of living does not  depend on  the ability of his or her employers to raise money to finance new development. In one way or another this new money must come from the savings of the country. The Stock Exchange  _  to provide a channel through which these savings can reach those who need finance.",
