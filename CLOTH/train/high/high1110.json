They can read all sorts of books, and  _  on all sorts of subjects. The world is a great deal wiser than it used to be. Everybody knows  _  of everything now . Do you not think, sir , that knowledge is an excellent thing ?\" \"  Why  , sir,\" replied the old man in surprise, looking  _  in manner, \"that depends  _  upon the use it is applied. It may be a blessing or a curse . Knowledge is only an  _  of power, and power may be bad,  as well as  a good thing\" \"That is what I can't understand, \" said the  _  little man. \"How can power be a bad thing?\"\n\"I will tell you\" calmly replied the old man and thus he went on: \"When the power of a horse is under control, the animal is  _  in bearing burden, drawing loads, and carrying his master, but  when  that power is out of control, the horse  _  his bridle  ,dashes to pieces the carriage that he draws, or throws his  _  . \" \"I see! \"  said the little man.\n\"When the ship is operated alright, the sail that she  _  enables her sooner to get into port, but if operated  _  ,the more sails she carries, the further she will go out of her course\"\"I see!\" said the little man, \" I clearly see! \"\n\"Well then,\"  _  the old man, \"if you see these things clearly, I hope you can see, too, that knowledge, to be good thing, must be rightly applied. God's grace in the heart will make the knowledge of the head a blessing but  _  this, it may  _  to us no better than a curse.\" \"I see! I see! \" said the little man, \"I see! \"",
