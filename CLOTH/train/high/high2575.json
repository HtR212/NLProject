    "article": "This is a part from US President Barack Obama's speech on May 14 at Bamard College in New York. ... My last piece of advice - this is simple, but perhaps most important:  _  . Nothing worthwhile is easy. No one of achievement has avoided failure - sometimes catastrophic failures. But they keep at it. They learn from mistakes. They don't  _  . When I first arrived on this  _  , I was with little money, fewer options. But it was here that I tried to find my place in this world. I knew I wanted to make a difference, but it was  _  how in fact I'd go about it. But I wanted to do my part to  _  a better world. So even as I worked after graduation in a few  _  jobs here in New York, even as I went from motley apartment to motley apartment, I  reached out  . ... And I wish I could say that this perseverance came from some innate toughness in me. But the truth is, it was  _  . I got it from  _  the people who raised me. I grew up as the son of a single mom who struggled to put herself through  _  and make ends meet. She had a marriage that fell apart;  _  went on food stamps at one point to help us  get by  . But she didn't quit. And she earned her degree, and made sure that  _  scholarships and hard work, my sister and I earned  _  . And  later on  , I met a woman who was assigned to advise me on my first summer job at a law firm. And she gave me such good advice that I married her. And Michelle and I gave everything we had to balance our careers and a  _  family. We made that marriage work. ... So  whether  it's starting a business, or running for office, or  _  an amazing family, remember that making your  _  on the world is hard. It takes patience. It takes commitment. It comes with plenty of  _  and it comes with plenty of failures.",
