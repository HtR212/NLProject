Now just before my\nfirst  _  of the day my eyelids were feeling heavier and\nheavier and my head was drifting down to my desk to make my textbook a  _  . A few minutes nap time before class couldn't   _  , I thought.\nBOOM! I lifted my head suddenly and my eyes opened wider than saucers . I looked around with my   _  beating wildly trying to find the\ncause of the  _  . My young professor was looking at me with\na boyish smile on his face. He had   _  dropped the textbooks he was carrying onto his\ndesk. \"Good morning!\", he said still  _  . \"I am glad to see\neveryone is  _  . Now let's get started. \"\nFor the next hour I wasn't sleepy at all. It wasn't from the   _  of my professor's textbook alarm clock\neither. It was instead from the  _  discussion he led. With\nknowledge and good  _  , he made the material come  _  . His insight was full of both wisdom and loving-kindness. And the\nenthusiasm and joy that he  _  with were contagious . I   _  the classroom not\nonly wide awake, but a little  _  and a little better as\nwell.\nI learned something far more important than not    _    in class that day too. I learned that if you are going to do something in this life,do it well,do it with   _  . What a\nwonderful place this would be  _  all of us did our work\njoyously and well. Don't sleepwalk your way through life then. Wake up! Let your love fill your work. Life is too   _  not to live it well.",
