    "article": "The only survivor of a ship that was missing in the sea was washed up by the wind onto a small, lonely island. He   _   eagerly for God to rescue him, and every day he examined the horizon point by point for   _  , but none seemed to be   _   the way.\nExtremely tired, he finally managed to build a little   _   out of wood that floats on the water to   _   him from the bad weather, and to   _   his few possessions. The hut was his only hope. But then one day, after searching for food, he arrived home to find his little hut in 42 _ , the smoke rolling up to the sky. In a minute, the hut burnt to ashes. The   _   had happened; everything was lost.\nHe was shocked with   _   and anger, and he was so desperate. \"God,   _   could you do this to me!\" he cried.\nEarly the next day,   _  , he was waken up by the sound of a ship that was   _   the island. It had come to   _   him. \"How did you know I was here?\" the   _   man asked one of his rescuers. \"We saw your smoke   _  ,\" he replied.\nIt is easy to get   _   when things are going bad. But we shouldn't lose   _  , because God is at work in our lives, 53 _  in the middle of pain and suffering.\nRemember, next time your little hut is   _   to the ground it just may be a smoke signal that is sent for the grace   of God.\nFor all the negative things we have to say to ourselves, God has   _   answers for them.",
