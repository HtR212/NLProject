The story reminds us of the importance of developing our full potential .\nOne day, a hardworking  _  found an eagle's egg lying on the ground of his farm. He was in a hurry  _  he paid no attention to it and  _  placed it together with all the chicken eggs. After several days, the egg hatched and the little eagle  _  into the world.\nThe eagle thought he was  _  same as the other chickens,  _  the eagle pecked and dug for worms. He ran about and sometimes jumped around, flying a few  _  in the air like the chickens. Over the years, the eagle grew old and tired. One day he saw a splendid bird  _  overhead, and asked, \"  _  is that?\" \"That's the king of the  _  -- the bald eagle,\" replied a chicken. \"The sky is her home. We're chickens -- our home is  _  the farm.\"\nAnd so the eagle lived and died  _  a chicken, for that's what he believed he was.\nAre you an eagle that  _  like a chicken?  _  , many people have great talents but  _  bring them to use. Actually, we  _  make our talents take off by developing our character strengths. Suppose there was a young man who  was interested  in the world. He asked questions about his environment, explored new neighborhoods where he lived, and soon he mentally mapped out the city he lived in. He used his curiosity to make the  _  of his talents for spatial intelligence.\nWhen we use our character strengths, we will  _  that we are eagles.",
