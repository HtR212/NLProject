Experiments were fun for me  _  a recent accident. The  _  happened when I was heating a big test tube with an alcohol burner , chatting to my partner while waiting for  _  changes. All of a sudden, the tube cracked. Even though I jumped from my seat when I heard the crack, the hair on my forehead was  _  as I was leaning too close to the test tube.  _  I had no time to be sad about my hair: the liquid in the test tube poured onto the table and caught fire. I'd never  _  anything so bad! My  _  went blank for a moment. Then I quickly covered the fire with a damp cloth to  put it out  . The teacher told me that the test tube broke in half at the bottom because we didn't dry it properly before  _  it. We calmed down and did the experiment, again. But our hearts were still  _  rapidly even after we walked out of the lab. But my bad  _  didn't end there! Since all  _  was focused on the flames while we were in the lab, I didn't see the liquid falling onto my trousers. During the following class, I felt a  _  in my leg. Soon it became more and more painful and I touched the area with my fingers,  _  to make things better. But to my great  _  , the material of my trousers turned into powder! \"Vitrio ! ! !\"The terrible word came into my mind. I rushed out right away to wash and examine my poor skin.  _  , it was not a serious injury. After changing my  _  I sat down and told myself: danger is no joke! It's very important to have a serious  _  in chemistry class. Doing scientific experiments as a learner is no laughing matter.",
