    "article": "Never Save Something Beautiful for That Special Day Years ago I was talking with a classmate in Sydney. At the time his wife had just passed away not too long ago. He told me while going through her things, he found a silk scarf  _  in a designer store when they had traveled to New York City. The scarf was beautiful, with elegant  _  , and a high price tag still hanging. His wife begrudged wearing it; she was  _  it for a special day. He  _  at that moment; I didn't say anything either. After a long pause he said: \"Never save something beautiful for that special day. Each  _  day is a special day.\" Whenever I  _  what he had said, I would put down the things I was doing to grab a novel, turn on the music and lie down on the couch to  _  some time for myself. I would appreciate the glorious scenery of the Tanshui River through a French window,  _  the dust gathered on the glass. I would take my wife out to  _  not thinking what to do with the meal already cooked. Life should be the experience we truly cherish, not days we just have to endure. One time I shared the above conversation with a lady. When I saw her again, she told me that she no longer  _  the beautiful china in a cabinet. She had thought to save them for a special day, only to discover that it never  _  came. \"Future\", \"someday\" are not contained in her  _  any more. If there are things that are pleasant or make her complacent, she wants to hear or see them now. We often hope to gather with old friends, but always say, \"let's find a(n)  _  .\" We often want to hug our grown children, but always wait for the appropriate moment. We often want to write to our spouses to express our strong affection or to show our deep admiration, but always tell ourselves that there is no need to  _  . In fact, each morning when we open our eyes, we should tell ourselves that this is a special day. Each day, each minute is so incredibly  _  .",
