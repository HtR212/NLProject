    "article": "As a young girl, I remember a very special doctor named Dr William R. Vincent. When I was eight years old, I was with a serious heart  _  and I needed heart surgery . My mom did not have the  _  to have it done, and  _  the surgery I would not live to be thirteen years old. After  _  several organizations Dr Vincent was  _  to get financial help for me through United Way, a Crippled Children's Organization.\nDr Vincent was very  _  and caring. I remember when I was in hospital for a(n)  _  before surgery, I was crying hysterically . So the medical workers  called in  Dr Vincent to calm me down, and he was able to  _  me when no one else could.  _  , the time came for me to have heart surgery; there was a fifty-percent  _  that I would not make it through the surgery. At that time I was only the second or third person to have it. I was really  _  , and again Dr Vincent reassured me he would see that  _  would be all right.\n  _  , the surgery was extremely painful but very successful. Dr Vincent came to see me and  _  me a toy animal. I was so surprised to get this  _  from Dr Vincent; I gave him a hug. I had a wonderful doctor who  _  time helping a scared little girl who felt all  _  . This was twenty-eight years ago. So wherever you are, Dr Vincent, I want to thank you for not only  _  my life, but also helping me live a(n)  _  life.",
