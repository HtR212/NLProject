    "article": "It was a warm Saturday morning in December. I reached my  _  exam centre which was unreachable by public transport. Not very nervous about my correspondence Bachelor Computer Application exam, I entered the examination hall and then  _  one corner seat in the classroom. On my front bench was an old man in his seventies.\nQuestion papers were  _  to us and I filled my answer sheet. I  looked at  the old man. He had neatly drawn lines for each  _  . Having handed in my paper, I came out of the hall and waited for him. He came out after the last bell. I  _  him and asked him what he would do with the  _  at this age (out of curiosity). He  _  replied, \"I thought I would find some good-looking girls here\". Later he told me how he was  _  before his grand kids for not knowing how to use a  _  and that he wanted to explore the box and things inside and be qualified   for it. My   _  question was \"Do you understand things written in the book at this age\" (as I  _  to understand many things in it). He cleared his throat and replied, \"We don't stop learning because we are old; we grow old because we stopped our learning. We elderly don't have  _  for what we have done, but rather for things we didn't do and the only people who  _  death are those with regrets.\" I admired the man for his  _  . I gave him a ride till his house and  _  telephone numbers.\nWe  _  our results after two months and we passed our exams. I  _  called the old man. His grand kid  picked up  the call and informed about his death.\nGrowing  _  is mandatory   but growing up is optional  .",
