    "article": "We didn't have a lot of money when I was little, so Mum had to   _  my fringe  herself. When we   look through   the old photos, she says she did well.\n\"One side always ended up shorter than the other, so I   _   to even things up ,\" she says.\nWhen I point out that her idea of evening things up made my head look   _  , we both burst out   _  . Sometimes my fringe would end up so   _  on my forehead that it didn't need cutting for months.\n  _   my mother would get it more or less right, but this then  _   me the nickname of Bully Beef. At the time, all the children were reading a book. In the  _  there was a character called Bully Beef. He had a fringe, which looked like his mother had put a bowl on his   _   and then cut round it. As Bully Beef wasn't a very nice   _  and I had long hair, I thought the nickname was rather   _  .\nWhen I was a teenager, as a treat, my mother took me to a hair salon,   _   they advised me to  _   my fringe. \"Her forehead is too big. It will look   _   if her fringe is cut.\" The hairdresser's   _  were a disaster for a teenager. But I wasn't the   _   one to come under attack. \"Hmm,\" he said, looking at my fringe, \"it looks   as if   someone has attacked her fringe with a knife and fork.\"\nMy mother   _   her anger and said, \"Oh, does it?\" Still, it made her think that perhaps it wasn't such a good idea for her to cut my fringe any more, and so I became a(n)   _   customer at the hairdresser's.",
