    "article": "Teenage years can be confusing for both teenagers and parents.At about 15, many teens start thinking about how they feel about themselves and  _  out how this matches or mismatches what others think of them.Most teens work through this  _  by the age of 16 or 17.\nOften teenagers are treated like  _  bigger children, but they will never become  _  and responsible if they are not allowed to make some decisions for themselves.If parents forbid their children from doing something, chances are that they will do it  _  without permission anyway.The role of a parent must, therefore, change from that of protector and keeper to that of friend and  _  .\nYet even the most caring parents misunderstand their children sometimes, and some think of teenagers as insecure, stubborn and  _  .As a result, teenagers always keep their  _  .from their parents.Teens often  _  that their parents repeat the same things over and over again and never listen to them.Parents must understand that teens need to be allowed to  _  their side of any problem and express their point of view.\nThus, more private and level-headed communication is needed for the parents.Every parent should try to schedule time to be  _  with their child, like taking a short trip together.This time allows parents to talk and listen without  _  from work or other family members.It might also be good to encourage teens to  _  important issues at dinner.Discussion time shows teens that parents are interested in them and their lives.\nA person's teenage years are a key time for them to identify their own  _  ,like distinguishing good from evil.Handling and improving communication with teenagers is not easy, but success will be  _  for parents and teens alike.",
