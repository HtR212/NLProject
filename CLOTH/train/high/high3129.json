    "article": "The 48-year-old American music teacher Amy Coplan took a trip to the Amazon jungle  hoping to see animals. What she discovered was  _  more valuable: children. \"I was really moved by what I found in the villages  _  I went down there to see the big animals,\"she said.\"They are  _  , but they are very rich in such ways as family, traditions and  _  life.\"\nCoplan wanted to do something to help improve the poor  _  she saw, but he found her skills  _  a piano teacher weren't exactly helpful. Searching the Internet, she found little information about the people  _  live in the village she visited in the Amazon jungle. Considering her  _  mind, she decided she could help the children  _  their own world.\nCoplan  handed out  cameras to children, aged between 12 and 16. In villages they enjoy only a few hours daily of solar-produced electricity. Coplan taught the children  _  to use the cameras. She was  _  by how quickly they learned to use them and by the photos they  _  .\n\"Kids just get it,\"she said.\nThe photos  _  in showing the moments of daily life in the Amazon  _  children' s eyes. Coplan hopes her project will  _  children's attention in the Amazon and she is working hard to  _  a small foundation .She wants the foundation to buy needed medicines, school supplies and  _  scholarship money to the children to continue their  _  outside the village if they choose so. I consider myself a  _  for these people, Coplan said. I don t wish to do anything but offer a chance for the children, and I just give them what I can give.",
