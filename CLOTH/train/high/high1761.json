As a long-time swimmer, I was used to receiving plentiful praises and  _  speeches from my coaches.  _  , after practicing for a few weeks, I noticed I did not hear any   _  like \"you're almost there\", \"congratulations\", or \"you're doing great\" that  _  me through the hard practice. I received scoffs  when I was expecting  _  and praises. To me, Vladimir seemed like a  _  man. \nAs I was trying to understand him through his heavy accent, I realized that Vladimir had been trained and  _  by the culture in Russia and that led to his different coaching style and unusually high  _  . He spent over 1,182 hours  _  , receiving no praises and was simply expected to  _  . This method of coaching that seemed so foreign to me was from what he  went through  , leaving home at the age of twelve, and eventually winning an Olympic medal.\nI began to appreciate his  _  to give out praises. He had a much different idea on how best to coach and motivate swimmers. He did not feel the  _  to say compliments , since he believed one should be  _  without these praises.\nIt was the fact that he was so different from my previous coaches that made him  _  .He forced me to really think about why I was swimming. I learned to swim not for  _  but to find the motivation. It became clear to me that the  _  of experiencing different coaching styles is that each one can bring out the best in me if I learn from these  _  . Various training styles may be   _   to me at the start but can help me grow in many ways.",
