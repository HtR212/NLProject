Then a pretty girl rushed towards me, saying, \"Hi, where are you going?\" I was so struck by the stranger that I had a hard time trying to  _  her. Clearly she had taken me  _  somebody else. I returned her greeting with politeness,  _  to give explanation to my girlfriend later. Noticing my dialogue with somebody else, my girlfriend  _  her eyes and found she was pretty. She asked jealously, \"Who's she?\" The pretty girl, quite  _  of the situation, spoke out first, \"Hi, let me  _  myself. I'm Nancy, used to be  _  . Very glad to meet you.\" She behaved very  _  . But I was  at a loss  to search in my memory for someone called Nancy among my neighbors. I was worrying how to explain this to my girlfriend  _  the pretty girl again turned to me, \"Will you give me your cell phone number so that we  _  keep contacts later?\" I had to submit to her  _  . Then the girl got off the bus at the next stop. A minute later I got a short  _  on my phone-from a stranger. My girlfriend  _  my phone and read the note. It was from the girl, who said, \"Just now, two thieves tried to  _  your pocket. I had to act as an acquaintance to draw your attention. I should have left at the  _  stop but gave up as I noticed these two thieves also  _  to leave at the same stop. Because of the  _  I delayed my departure. Now you' ll understand all I have done to you. Wish you luck.\"",
