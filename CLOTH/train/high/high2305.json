    "article": "Joan worked in a hospital as a nurse. One evening there was a big  _  at the hospital, but somebody had to be left to look after the sick children, and Joan was not the  _  one. She liked dancing very much, so she felt very  _  for herself. She went to one sick child after another and said good evening, until she came to Dickey, who was only eleven years old, but he was already able to talk  _  an adult. Poor Dicky had a very serious illness and now he was  _  able to move. Joan knew he would never get any better,  _  he was always happy and always  _  about other people instead of himself. Dickey knew that Joan loved dancing, so he  _  her with the words, \"I'm very sorry that you have to  _  the dance because of us. But we are going to have a party for you. If you look in my drawer, you'll find a piece of cake. And there is also a dollar for you to buy something to drink.\" \"And I'd  get up  and dance with you if I were able to,\" he added. Suddenly the hospital dance seemed not at all important to Joan.",
