I'd43 _ that I was one of the44 _ applicants applying for work experience.\nA few days later, I walked around the building for the first time, totally with45 _ . It wasn't the beautiful studios but the news team that46 _ me most. Before my BBC placement , I'd worked47 _ at a local commercial radio. Things there were always in a mess. This was  ly not the48 _ here.\nThe highlight of my two weeks there is that feeling of49 _ that the whole team unites and devotes their50 _ . All that hard work was worth it: you had51 _ listeners, insightful  interviewees, and all this added to the52 _ of the show. Sure, there were tough moments but if you53 _ then it'll all work out in the end.\nI54 _ plenty of actual work. Researching topics, booking guests, and meeting guests were all things I spent a lot of time doing, but that55 _ is not definitely complete and I also56 worked on a lead story for the breakfast show, too.\nI'm going back to study the final year of my broadcast journalism degree at the University of Leeds soon, but in my mind there'll be that57 _ of unemployment. Obviously my58 _ career is dependent on what opportunities will be in store for me, but59 _ there's one thing I've learnt, it's this: I want to work somewhere with a team of people as friendly and fantastic as the60 _ at BBC Radio Leeds.",
