Even though this is a  _  and necessary stage of our growth, it is often painful or  _  if we don't realize what's happening. In fact, confusion is often the  _  that tells us a change is taking place within us. These changes happen throughout the lives of all humans, as we move from babyhood to  _  to teenage years and beyond. With each change from one  _  to another, we find ourselves  _  goodbye to an old friend, the identity (,) that we  _  in order to move through that particular time. Sometimes we shape these identities in relationships or jobs, and when we change, those areas of our life become  _  . Usually, if we take the time to look into the changing surface of things, we will find that a change is taking place  _  us. For example, we may go through one whole part of our lives creating a protective shell around ourselves  _  we need it in defense of ourselves. One day,  _  , we may find ourselves feeling limited and bored, wanting to move outside the  _  we used to need; the new part of ourselves cannot be born within the  _  of the shell our old self needed. We may feel a strange  _  of excitement and sadness as we say goodbye to a part of ourselves that is  _  and make way for a whole new identity to  come out  in its place. We may find inspiration in working and studying when we think of the image of an animal who sheds (;) in order to  _  way for new skin, fur, or feathers to  _  . For example, keeping a piece of snake skin, or some other symbols of change, can  _  us that death and rebirth are simply nature's way of growing. We can give in to this process, letting go of our past self with great love and gratitude, and  _  the new with an open mind and heart, ready for our next stage of life.",
