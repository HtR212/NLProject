    "article": "One Saturday, I went shopping with my daughter, Helen, and son, Brandon. The car was filled with the children's laughing and singing. As we  _  up, we saw a truck with a big sign on it that  _  \"Petting Zoo. \" The kids jumped up and asked, \"Daddy, can we go?\" \"Sure.\" I said, giving them  _  a quarter (25 cents) before walking into the shopping center. They ran away and I felt free to take my time looking for  _  I needed. There are a hundred little baby animals of all kinds in the  _  zoo. Kids pay their money and stay there with the animals they like  _  their moms and dads shop.\nSeveral minutes later, I  turned around  and saw Helen walking along behind me. I was surprised to see she  _  o shop rather than play with the animals. And I thought the children had to wait till the parents came to  _  them up. I came up and asked what was wrong.\nShe  looked up  at me with those big brown eyes and said sadly. \"Well, Daddy. it cost 50 cents. So, I gave Brandon my  _  . \" Then she said the most  _  thing I ever heard. She repeated the family motto \"  _  is action!\" She had given Brandon her quarter, and  no one  loves little animals more than Helen. She had watched what both my  _  and I did for years around the house after we had said \"love is action!\" And now it had become a  _  of her lifestyle.\nThen we went back to the petting zoo. We stood  _  Brandon go crazy petting and feeding the animals. I had 50 cents  _  a hole in my pocket. I never  _  it to Helen, and she never asked for it. Because she know the whole family  _  : Love always pays.",
