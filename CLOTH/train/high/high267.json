Nothing had gone right all day.This traffic jam seemed the perfect ending to a(n)   _   day.\nI sighed loudly,  _   there was no one to hear.Lately my life seemed   _   more than a neverending   _   of regular tasks.Surely there was more to living than this.I guess I was simply too tired to look for it.\nAnd then, looking   _  , I saw him.\nThe lone  flagman was standing   in the middle of   the street,  _   directing four driving ways of traffic as they   _   into one.But there was something   _   about this flagman, and as my car   _  , I realized what it was.\nStanding among dozens of impatient motorists, he was smiling and   _   at every driver that passed.\nAs I sat waiting my   _   in my warm car, I began to feel   _  .If this man, who did nothing all day but watch one car after another  go by  , could stand in the cold rain hour after boring hour and still have a friendly   _   for every single person who passed, what right did I have to   complain about   my life?\nIt was   _   my turn to pass the flagman.\"Thank you,\" I mouthed   _   the window.He smiled and nodded and I drove on, spirits lifted,  _   changed.And in the rear view mirror  I could see him, raising his hand and   _   to every car that passed.",
