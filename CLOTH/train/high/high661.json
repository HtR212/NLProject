Last year, two days before Christmas, my friend Harry   _  , saying that their kitchen had caught fire,  _   everything in their kitchen, including all their food. Harry and his wife are   _   from Mexico with four children, and I knew they always had a(n)   _   harvest from their farm every year. After putting down the phone, I drove to their house, taking some   _   I had.\nWhen I arrived there, I found that they had all their belongs   collected up   in their front yard. They were so.  _   to see me, because they knew I could help them. Then I   _  back, but I was very   _  , knowing I was really in a hard place financially and was   _   to do more for them.\nI told a friend of mine about the story and asked if he could give a hand. He immediately  _   and said, \"I know these people mean a lot to you and I want to   _   them.\" You know, they had   _   met before. He asked me to take Harry to buy some necessities. Of course, he would   _  . At the check-out counter of a supermarket, I noticed we had chosen too many items, so I had the   _   take some back. As we were walking away, I  _   heard a voice behind me, \"Wait, I want to pay for them.\" I turned around, thanked the man   _  , and told him that my friend's house had been burned. He said he   _   because he had lost his job but was now working again. We went away with tears in our eyes. It was such a wonderful   _  , seeing folks stepped up when someone needed help, even for a  _   stranger.",
