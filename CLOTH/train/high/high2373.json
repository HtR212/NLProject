    "article": "During my P.E. class I met a girl, who was in a grade younger than me. She was always   _   on the playground and I wondered why she had   _   to talk to. I was sort of quiet girl myself, too, but I still had a few   _  . Over the whole year I would say \"Hi\" to her   _   sometimes she came to me and we   _   whatever sports we liked most.\nWhenever she came over I made it my   _   to make her laugh. I paid most of my   _   to her and not to my other friends because I saw them playing together   _   over there. Then, the   _   day of school year came around, I walked with her on the playground by ourselves. I asked her why she was so quiet. She told me her father left her   _   and her. Her mother was always crying at home.   _   this, I said nothing for a while. Then what I could do was   _   her to forget unhappiness and believe tomorrow is   _  . One day I told her I was leaving for high school. Hearing this she asked me not to   _   her. She told me that she had no other friends and I was her only one. Then, she told me that she would   _  me if I was in the high school. I   _   that I would go back to see her twice a week. Hearing my promise, her face   lit up   with smiles.\nPeople lose friends all the time but wise people know how to   _   the friendship. So don't ruin the   _   as time passed by. Remember that you are   _   to have a good friend.",
