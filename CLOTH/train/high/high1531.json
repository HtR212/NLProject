Retired pilot Bahadur Gupta will be happy to show you   _  . The plane, which never   takes off  , is giving an opportunity to poor people to   _   what it is like to sit in a jet.\nWhen Gupta started his career many years ago, people from his tiny home villages in India   _   asked him what it was like to be in an aircraft. None of them had ever   _   real airplane and they wanted a look at the aviation industry through Gupta's   _  . For security reasons, Gupta was never   _   to take his fellow villagers inside an actual aircraft. But saying no always made him feel uncomfortable and   _   and he always wanted to do something that would give them a   _   of flying.\nFinally, in 2003, Gupta sold some land, bought an old airplane and started offering   _   \"flights\" to the public, charging them only what they could   _  .\nTo make the experience   close to   real, the \"passengers\" are given boarding passes and even shown safety   _  . What   adds to   the amazing in-flight experience is when the kids   _   slide down the airplane's emergency landing slide, which many of the most frequent flyers have luckily   _   experienced.\nThe retired pilot says he hopes all his customers can   _   fly in a real plane, but in the meantime he is enjoying putting a/an   _   on their faces.",
