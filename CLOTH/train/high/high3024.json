    "article": "Before discussing different kinds of emotions, let us briefly talk about how researchers  _  bodily processes, actions and behavior, and how this relates to what we do in our daily lives when we observe emotions in  others  . Bodily processes can be directly measured by  _  of a polygraph. When a polygraph is skillfully used to  _  how we react bodily with what we are  _  , it is called a \"lie detector\". Bodily processes can also be measured  _  . This is what we do when we observe someone blushing . However, we are not always  _  of what bodily processes respond to. Measuring action  _  behavior is the other way researchers assess the emotions.  For example  , one measure of fear of snakes is how  _  a person will go to the snake. Another procedure is to have a person  _  how afraid he is, or how he feels, in this way, researchers have  _  the so-called \"fear thermometer\" to assess a person's fear.  _  our everyday living, we do very much the same thing. Only not too  _  . We react to what a person does, what he says,  _  he says it, and how he looks. Is he smiling? Is his voice trembling? We put all this  _  together to infer what a person is feeling.  _  , we do not always act as we feel. Sometimes we do things that we don't feel like doing.  _  we say we feel one way and then we act another. Actors, for example, successfully learn to \"make believe\" emotions, or learn to  _  them. Thus we  _  always tell what a person is feeling by what he says or by what he does.",
