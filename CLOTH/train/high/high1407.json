As a small child, I didn't know about the benefits of fresh food.   _  , I considered canned fish and fruit, bottled soft drinks and   _   snacks to be the most appetizing  . As I learned to prefer fresh and   _   foods to the artificial taste of chemically-enhanced snacks, I began to   think about   starting a vegetable garden in our backyard.\n\"What would it take?\" I asked my mom. We had the space and were   _   to take care of the plants every day.   _   doing some research online, we   _   to dig out a space of 16 square feet in our yard. It would have to be at least a foot deep   so that   with a raised vegetable bed, the vegetables would have two feet of depth to grow.\nIt was February of 2013. We knew that we had to work   _   if we wanted to plant vegetables that spring. That month, every day after school, I pushed   _   the tough clay   under our lawn with a large shovel  . Luckily, the rain made the soil   _  , and before we knew it, we had finished digging the bed. Next came my favorite part: shopping for   _   and plants. By June, our plants, especially the tomatoes, were growing   at risk  . We had never   _   such fresh tomatoes; they were so sweet that you could almost taste the   _   in them. To give our friends gifts, we packed jars of our little tomatoes. We also   _   Italian pasta sauce with our tomatoes and basil (,). It reassured (...) us to know that we were eating healthy and fresh produce.\nThe work we put into our vegetable garden was   more than   worthwhile. As long as we had the   _   to start and maintain the garden, we   _   a bountiful   harvest for the entire summer and fall in return. Thanks to the success of my vegetable garden, I can say that if the   _   of life is to be happy, I'm one little step closer.",
