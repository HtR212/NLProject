    "article": "In February of 2005, Phil Belfiore was teaching one of Robert Frost's poems \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.\" He liked it that he recorded it on his home answering machine, which would lead to one of the most unusual  _  of his life.\nWhen Phil returned from Easter vacation, he listened to his voice   _  . One gentleman caller  _  for dialing the wrong number. But, he added, he'd really  _  the poem. Phil laughed and thought nothing more of it---   _  the phone rang a few days later.\nPhil  _  John's hollow voice immediately, who said sorry to   _  , but he was calling to hear the  _  again. The two men talked. It turned out that his brother's phone number was   different  from Phil's by one digit , thus the wrong number. Before hanging up, Phil told John to  call back  anytime, whether to hear the poem or just to have a chat.\nThat was 11 years ago. They've spoken on the phone a few times a month ever since. It is John who is  _  the starter of most calls. However, Phil will ring if a long while has passed. Not  _  , John has been in poor health. His special voice is just the  _  of some heart trouble. They seem to always  connect  when there's been a big sports event. The men like to discuss  _  most. John will also  _  Phil about his life. Slowly, their conversations have grown much more  _  . When asked what drew them together, Phil   _  that they were told friends. They planned to meet twice, but circumstances went  _  them. Their friendship is based on the simple act of picking up the phone. \"My best friend is someone I've not yet met   in person  ,\" says John. It's as simple as that.",
