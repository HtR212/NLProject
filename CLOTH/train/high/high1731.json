She's  41 _    . \" Mom cried. \" I'll give her a full, happy life,Dad 42 _  .\nAs I grew, my parents realized I could see 43 _    . One day after school,my dad saw me holding Dick and Jane close to my eyes, 44 _   to read the letters. \"Dad, I can't do this. It's too  45 _   . \" I said.\n\"Honey, you're not a quitter. I'll help you. \" He painstakingly drew 46 _    big enough for me to see and then pronounced them. I learned to read after my father and eventually read Dick and Jane  47 _     with my classmates. Because of my dad, I had 48 _    in myself as a reader--until middle school.\nOne afternoon a student  49 _    me, \"You blind bat. If you get your face any nearer to that page, your eyes will fall out of your head!\" I ran out of the school in 50 _   . Dad was home when I burst in. \"I thought I was a good  51 _   , but the kids are making fun of me.\" Dad hugged me. \"I'm sorry, Pam. But that doesn't change the 52 _   . You can read and your classmates can't take that away from you, right?\" 53 _   to speak, I just nodded. After Dad's  54 _  , the knot  in my stomach went away.\nDad taught me to laugh at myself. He reminded me of the time I tried to 55 pick up   a sign painted to the floor. Another time , I 56 _   to eat flowers off an empty plate. When I was ten, I wanted to ride a two-wheeled bike. I heard Dad say to Mom, \"I'm not going to hold Pam back from the  57 _   any kid has. \" On my first attempt, I said, \"Dad, what if I fall off?\" His 58 _   was, \"You'll get on and try again. \"59 _  , I learned to skate, climb trees, and so on.\nI wouldn't be who I am today if it weren't for my dad. He made the  60 _   for me to be believer in myself.",
