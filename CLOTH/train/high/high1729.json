    "article": "When my parents were alive,they were not very rich.Yet they helped their two older  _  time after time.When Daddy passed away,his notebook showed debts  _  from several of his children.I was not among them.I  _  borrowed money and when I did,I set a repayment plan and  _  to it.It was a matter of  _  with me.I couldn't stand owing my parents-or anyone else-mmoney because I watched them  _  to help out my older sisters when they were in financial difficulties themselves. These days,after the death of my parents,I am one of those people who can be  _  to for help when they need it.Just as I can't stand  _  other people money,I can't stand saying no to whoever needs help.I don't  _  helping others,but I would be more than glad if they would make a(n)  _  to handle things themselves,perhaps by doing some  _  planning-like planning not to speend money they don't have! Being ready to help others is a  _  ,but sometimes the result will be  _  to what you expect.I  _  remember as a child what my father always said, \"If at first you don't succeed,try,try again!\" Helping my children too often has  _  them from learning to keep trying.Use your  _  :who among my children will  _  to walk if I supply the money to buy a car? Helped often,my children lost gradually the ability to  _  problems themselves. In most  _  ,when people find you can  _  help,they will ask you more and more.That's human,you know.",
