    "article": "Risha loved school. However, there was one class Risha worried about more than any other--art. She didn't know why she just wasn't any good at  _  , painting, or cutting.\nMs. Clay, the art teacher, stood at the front of the room. \"Class, next Friday our school is going to have an art  _  ,\" she announced. Ms. Clay was a great teacher, and Risha liked her a lot. But this announcement made Risha  _  . \"Everyone in the school will create a piece of artwork to  _  in the library. You can use the different types of artwork we have been studying.\" Ms. Clay was quite excited when she spoke  _  Risha found herself sinking lower in her chair.\nRisha had the whole weekend to work on her project,  _  she could not think of anything to do. On Monday, Risha felt frightened, so after school Risha asked Ms. Clay if she could write an art paper  instead of  doing an art project.\n\"I understand this project  _  you, Risha,\" Ms. Clay said. \"Just remember, you can\n  _  any kind of art you want.\" Ms. Clay smiled at her. \"Art is a person's way of expressing his or her feelings--it isn't always painting, drawing, or cutting. I know you will think of something very creative, and I can't  _  to see it.\"\nWhen Risha arrived home, she took out a piece of paper and a pencil. She  _  Ms. Clay's words. \"Art is a person's way of expressing his or her feelings.\" Risha wrote the word \"terrified\" on her paper. She crumpled(......) the paper and threw it to the side of her desk. Then Risha stared at the crumpled ball. It reminded her of a snowball.  _  an idea struck her. Why not create a winter wonderland out of crumpled paper? Risha didn't have to draw or paint or  _  cut.\nRisha crumpled lots of paper balls, glued them all together, and  _  them on a big piece of hard paper to form a snowman. The snowman  _  a hat made of black paper and a scarf made of red paper. And she even crumpled brown and green paper to create a forest. Her  _  project was really wonderful.\nOn Friday, Risha carefully carried her project into the library. She noticed the  _  and the nods from teachers and other students  _  she put her work on a table. Ms. Clay walked over to Risha.\n\"You have created an original and amazing piece of artwork. I am so proud of you!\" Ms. Clay said.\nRisha was proud of herself too. Her pride  _  when Ms. Clay placed a first-place star on her artwork. \"Maybe I am a good  _  after all,\" Risha thought.",
