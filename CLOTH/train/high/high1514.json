Emily  _  there for a moment, calculating her chances of survival.  _  the chances were in her favor, she sat up with a  _  that quickly turned into tears when she saw the blood on her knee. I took her in my arms, saying words of  _  as I carried her into the house to deal with her hurt.\nWith much comfort, she let me wash and put ointment   on her  _  .\nI kissed her cheek.\"All  _  now, sweetie?\"\n\"No, Grandma, you haven't said the Mommy  _  ,\" she said.\nI  _  ran a list of Mommy words through my mind:Please?Thank you?I love you?\n\"You know, Grandma.

We kissed and hugged, and said the Mommy words to each other.",
