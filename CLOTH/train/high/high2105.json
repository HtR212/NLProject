At age five, this dull task brought me such   _  . I would excitedly turn the tap     _   and brush the comb carefully. Satisfied that I'd done a good job, I would happily return the comb to Dad. He would   _   affectionately at me and place the comb on his wallet.\n   Two years later, Dad started his own   _  , which wasn't doing so well. That was when things started to   _  . Dad didn't come home as early and as much as he used to. Mum and I became   _   with him for placing our family in trouble. With   _  , an uncomfortable silence grew between us.\n   After my graduation, Dad's business was getting back on track. On my 28th birthday, Dad came home   _  .  As usually I helped him carry his bags into his study. When I turned to leave, he said, \"Hey, would you help me   _   my comb?\" I looked at him a while, then   _   the comb and headed to the sink.\n   It hit me then: why, as a child,   _   Dad clean his comb was such a pleasure. That routine   meant Dad was home early to   _   the evening with Mum and me. It   _   a happy and loving family.\n   I passed the clean comb back to Dad. He smiled at me and   _   placed his comb on his wallet. But this time, I noticed something   _  . Dad had aged. He had wrinkles next to his eyes when he smiled,   _   his smile was still as   _   as before, the smile of a father who just wanted a good   _   for his family.",
