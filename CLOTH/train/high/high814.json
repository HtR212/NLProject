    "article": "Fifteen years spent in the field of education has provided me with many treasured moments. One of the most unforgettable  _  when I was teaching second  _  , 10 years ago. In May I decided to plan something special for the children: a Mother's Day tea. We had put our heads together to  come up with  ideas of how to  _  our mothers. We practiced singing songs, memorized poems and wrote cards. We decided to hold our tea the Friday before Mother's Day. I was surprised and  _  to learn that every mother was planning to attend. I  _  invited my own mother. Finally, the big day arrived. Each child  _  up at our classroom door, expecting the arrival of his or her mom.  _  it got closer to starting time, I looked around and my eyes quickly found Jimmy. His mother hadn't shown up and he was looking  _  . I took my mother by the hand and walked over to Jimmy. \"Jimmy,\" I said, \"I have a bit of problem here and I was  _  if you could keep my mother  _  while I'm busy.\" My mom and Jimmy sat at a table. Jimmy  _  my mom her treats, presented her with the gift I had made, just as we had  _  the day before. Whenever I looked over, my mother and Jimmy were in deep  _  . Now 10 years later, I work with students of all ages, educating them about the environment. Last year, I took a senior class on a field trip, and there was Jimmy. I had the students complete an outline of the day's  _  and an evaluation of our trip. Then I collected the students' booklets and checked them to see if  _  was completed. When I came  _  Jimmy's page, he had written \"Remember our Mother's Day tea we had in second grade, Mrs. Marra? I do! Thanks for all you did for me, and thank your mother, too.\" I told him I really enjoyed what he had written. He looked rather embarrassed and  _  his own thanks and walked away. Suddenly he ran back and gave me a big hug. \"Thanks again. No one even knew my mother didn't  _  it.\" I ended my workday with a hug from a teenage boy who had  _  stopped hugging teachers years ago.",
