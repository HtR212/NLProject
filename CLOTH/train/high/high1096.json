As the assistant of the Honors Programs at the university, one of my  _  was to review student transcripts to make sure they could  _  in Honors. It was common for students to have a(n)  _  start and they could no longer continue in Honors after their first term. However, sometimes their  _  term report cards would still be sent to us even though the students were no longer in the program.

Best of luck in keeping up the good work, and you'll be able to succeed.\" The student went on and said, \" You can't know what this  _  to me. I've carried it in my purse for three years and pulled it out anytime I didn't want to do my  _  . For three years I've been  _  to enter your office and giving you this note and this  _  . \" she handed me her latest transcript with good marks. We were both  _  . She cried and I  _  to.
