    "article": "James was a curious young man. Everywhere he went, he liked to observe things and to  _  people--what they did, what they said and what they wore. Subconsciously, he was making quick  _  all the time. He couldn't really  _  it; it just happened. For example, he once saw a man whose body was  _  with tattoos . That man was strong and walked proudly. James imagined his  _  people up, sometimes with sticks and sometimes with his hands, speaking  _  words each time he opened his mouth. A troublemaker, perhaps, James  _  to himself. Sometimes James felt  _  for judging others this way, but that feeling was  _  and never really lasted. Then, one day, he saw a woman seated alone in a cafe. The woman was  _  , quite fat, and although she was not  _  , James could tell she was a short lady.  As usual  , James glanced across at her, looking at her from top to bottom. As his eyes reached her  _  , he got a shock. There she was, on her left foot, wearing a platform shoe that was at least 3 inches high.  _  could such a little middle-aged lady who was average-looking at best be so vain as to wear high platforms? Look beautiful? In that short moment of time,  _  thoughts flowed through James' mind. A second later, James' eyes naturally moved across to the lady's right foot. And there, he got an even bigger  _  . ----It was a flat shoe. She was not vain; she had a birth defect ----uneven length of her legs. If anything, she deserved  _  and understanding, certainly not blame, not even mental ones. James was  _  with guilt. It was a(n)  _  lesson he learned about not  jumping to  conclusions, about not judging people, especially so quickly.",
