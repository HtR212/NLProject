If you are lucky enough to find such teachers, you will always find your way.\nMy old professor's death   _   came in 1994. Doctors guessed he had two years left. Morrie knew it was   _  . Do I droop and disappear, or do I make the best of my time left? He had asked himself.   _   everyone was going to die, he could be   _   great value, right? He could be a human   _   for students to learn.\nThe last class of my old professor's life had only   one   student. I was the student. The last class   took place   once a week in his house, by a window in the study   _   he could watch a small plant shed its pink leaves. The subject wasThe Meaning of Life. You were   _   to respond to questions, and you were expected to raise questions of your own. You were also required to perform physical tasks now and then, such as lifting the professor's head to a comfortable spot on the pillow or placing his glasses on the   _  of his nose. Kissing him good-bye earned you extra   _  . Many topics were   _  , including love, work, community, family, aging, forgiveness, and, finally, death.\nI   look back   sometimes at the person I was before I rediscovered my old professor. I want to talk to that person. I want to tell him to pay attention when your loved ones are speaking,as if it   were   the last time you might hear them. I know I cannot do this. None of us can   _   what we've done, or relive a life already recorded. But if Professor Morris Schwartz taught me anything, it was this: there is no   such   thing as \"too late\" in life. He was   _   until the day he said good-bye.",
