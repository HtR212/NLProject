He called his parents from    San Francisco    \"Mom and Dad, I    am coming   home ,but I've a favor to ask .I have a friend I'd like to bring home with me.\" \"    Sure   ,\" they replied, \"We'd love to meet him.\" \"There's something you should know,\" the son continued , \"he was   hurt badly   in the fighting. He   _   on a land bomb and lost an arm and a leg. He has nowhere else to go ,and I want him to    live with   us.\" \"I'm sorry to hear that ,son. Maybe we can help him find somewhere to live.\" \"No, Mom and Dad ,I want him to live with us.\" \"Son,\" said the father , \"you don't know what you're asking. Someone with such    _    would be    a terrible burden   on us. We have our own lives to live ,and we can't let something like this    _    with our lives. I think you should just come home and    _   about this guy . He'll find a way to live    _    his own.\nAt that point, the son   hung up    the phone. The parents heard    _   more from him. A few days later ,   _   ,they received a call from the San Francisco police. Their son had died after falling from a building .The police believed it was a    _  .They grief-stricken parents flew to San Francisco to    _   the body of their son. They recognized him, but to their horror they also discovered something they didn't know, their son had    only one arm and one leg  .\nThe parents in this story are like many of us .We find it    _   to love those who are good-looking or fun to have around ,but we don't like people who are    _   to us or make us feel uncomfortable. Thankfully, there's someone who loves us with an   _   love that welcomes us into the forever family.",
