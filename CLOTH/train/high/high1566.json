For us, that  _  a white metal cabinet in our utility room filled with cans of food. We could  _  eat anything out of the cabinet because \"you never know\" when a hurricane will come. As a kid, I was  _  about the white cabinet. I thought it was kind of strange to have food in the utility room. But, one look from my mother  _  me from opening the door to glance inside. One year, Channel 4 reported that Hurricane Dora was  _  for the northern part of Florida. Soon the storm got  _  and the wind blew. Then, the tall pine trees started to sway. And,  _  \"sway\", I meant \" fall over or crash down on anything in their way\". We were lucky, as the  _  went other directions and didn't take our power out. However, when my mother started cooking, the power was out.  _  I calculated it was time to crack open that white cabinet. But, Dad thought it was time to  _  up the charcoal grill( ) outside where it was raining and windy. To this day, I never  _  a man's love for his grill. Our power came back for a while. So, my mother began cooking everything she could and  _  it away, to the neighbors, to friends without power, to anyone with  _  . I was hoping that the fried chicken was going to find its way to our  _  . But, it didn't. And, just as the last of the food was sent out and she began to work on our dinner, yes, we lost our  _  . It was time for 20 minutes' eggs on the grill. Oh, the white metal cabinet. No. We never  _  it. We weren't \"that bad off\" as I understand it. And, for years I  _  how bad off we would have to be to eat out of that cabinet. Perhaps it was just the  _  of it, the thought that it was there watching our backs  _  we wanted a can of beans or some potted meat. I don't know if that was what was in there. Anyway, I never looked inside.",
