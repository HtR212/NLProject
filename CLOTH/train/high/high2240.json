As my daughter, Nicole, prepares to leave home for college, I'm discovering how hard it is to stay on the  _  side of this line. When I hold  _  the apron strings connecting us, Nicole, eager to  _  independence, tries to loosen my grasp. What results is a (an)  _  mother-daughter, push-me, pull-you kind of tango. For the past two years, it's gone like this: My question: \"Have you thought of taking an advanced placement class so that you can earn college credit?\" Nicole's  _  : \"No, I'm not interested in that.\" ......... Two months ago, she was  _  to a great university. However, I was still the mother having a  _  time letting go. The night before the introductory meeting of the university, I had read the course catalog carefully and  _  courses which I thought looked good. We met on the campus the next afternoon, and Nicole's face  lit up  with excitement. \"I have had my entire schedule figured out,\" she said. \"Already?\" I was astonished,  _  she should have discussed it with me. I examined the schedule. Nicole hadn't taken a (an)  _  one of the courses I had suggested. Every course she had chosen  _  suited her interests. Just then I saw a mature, capable young woman with a  _  mind and the ability to shape her future. She no longer needed her mother's  _  every decision she made. I felt proud, though still a bit  _  . I  _  the lessons carefully. Nicole has struggled to learn over the past 18 years:  _  , sympathy, and hard work. There have been a few holes along the way.  _  , she is well-equipped and eager to  _  the future. The next step, I recognized, was mine to take: giving my daughter and myself the  _  we both needed.",
