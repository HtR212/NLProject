    "article": "Children start out as  _  scientists, eager to look into the world around them.  _  them enjoy science can be  _  ; there's no need for scientific terms or expensive lab equipment. You only have to share your children's interests. Firstly, listen to their questions. I once  _  a classroom of seven-year-olds to talk about science as a job. The children asked me \"textbook questions\" about schooling, salary and my job. When I  _  answering, I said, \"  Now that  we're finished with your lists, do you have questions of your own about science ?\" After a long  _  , a boy  _  his hand, \"Have you ever seen a grasshopper  _  ?When I try eating leaves like that, I get a stomachache. Why ?\" This began a set of questions that  _  nearly two hours. Secondly, give them time to think. After asking a question, teachers often wait only one  _  or less for an answer, no time for a child to think. When teachers  _  their \"wait time\" to three seconds or more, children usually give better answers. Thirdly, watch your language. When children are having a science discussion, don't jump in with \"That's right\" or \"Very good\" because these  _  may make the children think that discussion is over.  Instead  , keep things going by saying, \"I'd never thought of it that way before\", or coming up with more questions or ideas. Never  _  a child to \"think\". It doesn't make sense, because children are always thinking without your telling them to. What's more, this can turn a conversation  _  a performance.  Lastly  , show in stead of telling. Let children look at their fingers through a magnifying glass ,  so that  they'll understand why you want them to  _  before dinner. Rather than say that water evaporates , set a pot of water to boil and let them watch the water level  _  .",
