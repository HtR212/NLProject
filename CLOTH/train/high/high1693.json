Another   _   or two away is a lovely, lively street with stalls   _  Mexican, Thai and French food, as well as cafes, sandwich places and many other stores.\nOne day, as I was walking around during lunchtime, I33 _   a small elderly lady pushing an empty pushchair slowly along the pavement. I  _  wanted to do something for her, but I felt a little   _  following around, so I decided to continue my   _  . A few minutes later, when I was passing a grocery store , I saw her   _  groceries into her pushchair inside the store. That's  _  I decided to help by paying for her shopping.\nThe cashier  looked at me in   _  as I tried to explain that the money I was   handing over   was for the elderly lady.  It must have been the  _  time any one had done this in the store,   _  she just couldn't quite get her head around the whole thing. And it was  _  for me to explain this in front of the other people queuing to pay for their  _  .\nThe cashier 45 _  a colleague ( ) over and I tried to explain it again. \"In a few minutes an  _   lady with a pushchair will be coming through the check-out; I have   _  your colleague some money that should help to pay for all or most of her shopping.\" Thankfully, they got the   _  an smiled at last. \nI didn't  _   to watch, but I hoped the surprise awaiting her at the check-out would bring a   _   to her face that day.",
