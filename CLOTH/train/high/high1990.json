Usually the accommodations were in  _  buildings and we were on Level 4.\nFor two years ,my dad had been trying his application for a  _  level house to make the  _  much easier for my mom who had  _  complications  after her second operation. She was advised to have outdoor  _  but going up the stairs every day was  _  for her. As luck would have it, my dad's ground level application was  _  . Hearing the good news Mum and Dad were extremely  _  to move into the ground level accommodation in a separate building.\nWithout wasting time, they did the big  _  the following Saturday and Mum's  _  was removed. The following Monday, when my dad was about to enter the house, he saw an old lady and her old husband  _  to bring a wheelchair down the stairs. He was  _  and moved. When he ran quickly to  _  them,the old lady said ,\"Don't worry ,son. We are used to it now. We have been doing the same thing for our  _  daughter during the past 15years. \" Her kind and yet sad words  _  my dad in the heart.\nThe following Saturday ,my mum and dad  _  the apartment with the old couple and they were back to Level 4 in their previous building.\nMy father was dead for twenty years,  _  it is still in my memory that every time the old couple  _  my dad and me anywhere, they would just look at us with  _  in their tearful eyes and say to me,\"You have an angel for a father!\"and it brought tears of  _  to my eyes every time.",
