He was in the lake, and there was a small boat nearby. At  _  we knew he had fallen from the boat and couldn't swim  _  enough to reach it or to get to shore. As we ran toward the lake I saw him  _  , and I was sure that he had drowned. But after a moment his head  _  again. Quickly John took off his shoes,  _  into the water, and started swimming toward the  _  man. He reached him just as the man was  _  down again. He was  _  enough to stretch out his hand and try to catch  hold  of the man's clothing or his hair before he sank. But the man  _  out his arms, caught John  _  the neck and began to  _  him down under the water. John fought to  _  his head above the water, and at the same time  _  to swim toward the boat, pulling the man with him. I also jumped into the water to help,  _  the boat with one hand and swimming with the  _  . The man looked dead, with his heart  _  weakly. We did what we  _  to save him. At last we succeeded.",
