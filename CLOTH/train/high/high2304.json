I thought the villagers would be interested.  _  , when I asked them what their  _  were, many of them looked at me as if I were  _  . They said they didn't have dreams. No dreams!? I didn't believe this  _  and tried to guide them, asking them to  think of  the dreams they had as a kid. Rather  _  , one woman said she didn't know what the use of dreams was when the rats were nearly eating up their kids. There were  _   in her screen door  ,  _  which the rats could freely get in and out.\nThen I asked the villagers if there was anyone who knew how to  _  a screen door. A man said he could have a  _  . I gave him some  _  to buy the things he needed for repairing.\nThe next time we  _  , the woman told me excitedly that she didn't have to  _  about the rats any longer. And she had enough energy to learn sewing  -what she wanted to do for years. Soon she  _  a clothes shop.\nAs to the man who did the  _  work, he said he found nothing could be more  _  than repairing things. He found back himself he had  _  for a long time from that repairing experience. Later he became a special repairman.\nThat  _  the villagers to begin to dream. These seemingly small successes allowed the villagers to see that everyone had a dream and the dream was not far.",
