Although there were many policemen  _  , the Blare were not able to get to their waiting car  _  at all. Word spread that they had composed a new song which would be  _  when they performed at the concert that evening.They were now  _  with loud cries of \" Play your new song! Play your new song!\" When the stars prepared to sing as the  _  for getting away, even the policemen looked  _  , too. The fans settled down and listened to the first  _  of the new song.Once it was over, everyone started jumping, clapping and shouting  _  . Several young women even fainted with excitement and were carried away immediately by the  _  standing by. The fans were greedy for more,  _  .Once again, the performers had no choice but to  give in  , but when they were asked for still another song, they cheerfully but firmly refused.Closely  _  by the policemen, they walked towards their car some distance  _  . The fans pushed forward, but the policemen,  _  arm, prevented anyone getting trough. It took the stars quite a long time to reach their  _  !
