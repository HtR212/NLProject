    "article": "Many of my friends have experienced of a four-day step: on the first day, they meet each other and  _  their mobile numbers; on the second day, he sends her a short  _  saying how he has madly, passionately and hopelessly fallen in love with her; and on the third day, he  _  her out to see a movie, then he holds her hand in  _  ; so on the fourth day, they become a common couple among the thousands of young  _  on campus.\nSince I am not the president of university, I don't want to say that there should be a/an  _  on public display of affection. But I just feel  _  whether it is the best way to  _  our love in publiC. Well, unfortunately, I haven't   _  my Mr. Right now. To tell the truth, I really feel  _  of those young lovers. But deep in my heart, I more than once  _  how I should meet my Mr. Right, and how we should display our love in publiC. My imagination was like this: That would be a rainy Sunday afternoon, and I was  _  in the library. Suddenly, my hands stop at a book called A Beautiful Mind, and  _  at the same time, another boy  _  out his hand for the same book. \"Excuse me.\" he saiD. Then I  _  my eyes, and I saw a handsome tall boy, just like Beckham, with a high nose and  _  a blushing smile looking at my face. Oh, I was drunk with the beautiful feelings -- I really found him. We've found our  _  in reading books, and from then on, we should go to the bookstores in our city whenever we wer  _  . And the best scene in my mind to show our love in public is  _  we lie on the grass land on my campus, and I read a part of Jane Eyre to him, and he reads a part of Oliver Twist to me. Don't you think it is a romantic  _  for the young lovers to show their love to each other?",
