    "article": "Every country has its heroes.The heroes are the people the nation and especially the young people   _  .If you get a list of the heroes of a nation, it will tell you the potential of that nation.For example, the youngsters in China nowadays take Yang Liwei   as a model   ever since the launch  of Shenzhou V.\n       If today in America you ask the high school students to list their heroes, their   _   would probably fall into three groups.The first group of heroes would be the rock stars--the people   _   with rock music.There's no doubt that such people have talent but one often wonders if one should   hold up   rock stars as a model.The rock stars too often are mixed with drugs and their personal life is not all that   _  .The rock stars are rich and they wear the latest fashion styles.However, one should   put   more in a hero than such things   _   money and fine clothes.\n       A second type of heroes for the American youth are sports star.  Again  , you have a person who has a talent in one area- sports.However, too often the personal of the sports star is   a bit   disorder.Too frequently drugs and drinking are a part of   _   of the sports stars.\n       A third group of heroes are TV or movie stars.These people may have lots of   _   talent and are quite handsome.However, the personal life of too many actors is quite sad and   should not   be held up as a model for young people.\n       Today, the rock stars, the sportsmen and the actors have   all   become the models of the youth in America.Really, do you hear a young person say that his   _   is a doctor, a teacher or a scientist? These people are not   _   and do not wear fashionable clothes.However, they are   _   people who work hard to make the world a better place for everyone.\n       What is really sad is that the young try to   _   their heroes.They like to wear the same clothes as theirs.If the heroes of today for the American youth are   _   only to rock stars, sports and actors, the future does not look too   _  .",
