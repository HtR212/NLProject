    "article": "You've probably seen blind people walking with their trusted and gentle four-legged guides-or \"seeing-eye\" dogs. The   _   trained dogs serve as eyes for people who can't see, making it   _   for them to lead independent lives.  _   what you probably didn't know is that about 80 years ago, a doctor and his patient discovered this entirely   by accident  !\nMany people were killed or injured during World WarI. Near the end of that war, Dr. Gerhard Stalling and his   _   walked with a patient--a German soldier who had been   _  -around hospital grounds in Germany.\nWhile they were walking, the doctor was   _   away. The dog and the soldier stayed outside. A few moments later, when the doctor returned, the dog and the soldier were   _  ! Searching the paths worriedly, Dr. Stalling made an astonishing   _  . His pet had led the soldier   _   around the hospital grounds. And together the two   _   peacefully back toward the doctor.\n  _   by what his dog could do, Dr Stalling set up the first   _   in the world to train dogs as guides. Dorothy Eustis, an American woman   _   as a dog trainer for the International Red Cross in Switzerland, was   _   to study the way Stalling trained dogs and spent several months in his school. She came away so impressed that she wrote a(an)   _   about it for theSaturday Evening Postin America.\nA blind American man, Morris Frank,   heard about   the article and he wrote to Dorothy Eustis and asked that she   _   a dog for him. Dorothy Eustis took up the   _  , and trained a dog, Buddy. She brought Frank over to Switzerland to join her in the training   _  . Frank went back to the United States with what many believe to be America's first guide dog in 1928.",
