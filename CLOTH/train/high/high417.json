    "article": "Another person's enthusiasm was what set me moving toward the success I have achieved. That person was my stepmother. I was nine years old when she entered our home in rural Virginia. My father  _  me to her with these words: \"I would like you to meet the fellow who is  _  for being the worst boy in this county and will probably start throwing rocks at you no  _  than tomorrow morning.\" My stepmother walked over to me,  _  my head slightly upward, and looked me right in the eye. Then she looked at my father and replied,\"You are  _  . This is not the worst boy at all,  _  the smartest one who hasn't yet found an outlet for his enthusiasm.\" That statement began a(n)  _  between us. No one had ever called me smart. My family and neighbors had built me up in my  _  as a bad boy . My stepmother changed all that. She changed many things. She  _  my father to go to a dental school, from which he graduated with honors. She moved our family into the county seat, where my father's career could be more  _  and my brother and I could be better  _  . When I turned fourteen, she bought me a secondhand  _  and told me that she believed that I could become a writer. I knew her enthusiasm, I  _  it had already improved our lives. I accepted her  _  and began to write for local newspapers. I was doing the same kind of  _  that great day I went to interview Andrew Carnegie and received the task which became my life's work later. I wasn't the  _  beneficiary . My father became the  _  man in town. My brother and stepbrothers became a physician, a dentist, a lawyer, and a college president. What power  _  has! When that power is released to support the certainty of one's purpose and is  _  strengthened by faith, it becomes an irresistible force which poverty and temporary defeat can never  _  . You can communicate that power to anyone who needs it. This is probably the greatest work you can do with your enthusiasm.",
