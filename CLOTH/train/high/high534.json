    "article": "Recently, a couple in New Zealand were forbidden from naming their baby son 4Real. Even  _  New Zealand has quite free rules about  _  children, names beginning with a  _  are not allowed. They decided to call him Superman  _  . In many countries around the world,  _  names for children are becoming more popular. In Britain, you can call a child almost  _  you like. The only restrictions on parents  relate  to offensive words such as swear words.  Some  parents choose names which come from  _  culture. For example, there have been six boys named Gandalf  _  the character in the Lord of the Rings novels and films.  _  , names related to sport are fairly common -  _  1984, 36 children have been called Arsenal after the football team. Other parents like to  make up  names, or combine names to make their own  _  names, a method demonstrated by Jordan, the British model,  who  recently invented the name Tiaamii for her daughter by  _  names Thea and Amy (the two grandmothers). Some names which were previously  thought of  as old-fashioned have  _  popular again, but the most popular names are not the strange  _  . The top names are fairly  _  , for example, Jack, Charlie and Thomas for boys and Grace, Ruby and Jessica for girls.",
