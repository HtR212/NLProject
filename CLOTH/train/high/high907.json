    "article": "(20;l.5,30) ,(A, B, CD), . . Twenty years ago,I drove a taxi for a living.I met  _  people.But none touched me  _  than a woman I picked up late one night. I received a call from  an apartment  in a quiet part of town.When I arrived at 2:30 a.m.,the building was  _  except for a single light in a ground floor window.I walked to the door and  _  .\"Just a minute,\"answered a  _  ,elderly voice.After a long pause,the door opened.A small woman  _  her 80s stood before me.Beside her was a small suitcase.I took it to the taxi.and then returned to  _  the woman.She took my arm and we walked  _  toward the roadside. Seated,she gave me  an address  .\"I'm on my way to a hospice .I'm in no hurry.Can you drive through downtown?\" I saw her eyes shining with  _  in the rearview mirror.\"I don't have any  _  left.\"she continued.\"The doctor says I don't have very long.\" During the next two hours'  _  , sometimes she asked me to  _  in front of a particular building or corner and she  _  stare into the darkness.When we got to the destination,she asked,\"How much do I  _  you?\" \"Nothing,\"I said.\"You  have to  make a living.\"she answered.\"I have  _  passengers,\"I replied,and gave her a hug. She held onto me  _  .\"You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,\" she said.\"Thank you.\" After that,I drove aimlessly,lost in thought.People usually believe that our lives center upon great moments.  _  great moments often catch us unaware,beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a small one.",
