There was a hundred dollars in it, which was all the money I had  _  until my next pension comes. Next Thursday is Thanksgiving Day, and I have invited my last two friends for  _  . Without that money, I have  _  to buy food with. I have no family to  turn to  , and you are my only  _  . Can you please help me?\" The man was  _  , and went around showing the letter to all the other workers. Each of them  _  their wallets and donated a few dollars. By the time he  _  his showing, he had collected 96 dollars.  _  then he sent it to the old woman. Thanksgiving Day came and went. The workers  _  forgot about it. Then one day, there came another letter from the old lady to God. All the  _  gathered around when the letter was  _  . It read, \"Dear God, how can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your kindness, I was able to  _  a lovely dinner for my friends. We had a very  _  day, and I told my friends about your  _  gift. Thank you very much!\" Seeing this, all the workers felt  _  with the nice thing they had done. They looked into each other's eyes and smiled.",
