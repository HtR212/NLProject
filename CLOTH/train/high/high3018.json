We became quick friends,   _   each other.\nWe often talked about the sunrises and sunsets on the web, and I   _   with Mattie that being a black, I wasn't a beach person because there was no   _   for me to tan . He strongly   _   me to go to the beach that he and his mom visited. He always   _   every single second of the present. He could not understand why everybody wasn't out on the beach at   _   during their vacation, and he couldn't   figure out   why people would want to miss a   _  . I said, \"Mattie, most people don't like to   _   early on vacation.\"\nWe also talked a lot about   _  . He said to me one day, \"I sometimes get a little unhappy or angry when I'm   _   of dying.
