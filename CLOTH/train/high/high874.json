    "article": "Once, long ago, there was a man who traveled from Persia to India on foot. He had  _  been to India before. When he arrived at a village, he happened upon a fruit stand. In that village, fruit was quite  _  because of the lack of water. The man was looking around at the fruits when he  _  a big basket of some very red, very long fruit. It was the cheapest fruit in the shop, not expensive at all.  _  the man walked up to the counter and asked: \"How  _  per kilo?\" And the shopkeeper said: \"Two rupees.\" Two rupees in India is  _  . The man thought to himself: \"What a  _  !\" So he bought a whole kilogram of the fruit and began to  _  it. But after he tried a few pieces, he screamed: \"Oh, my God!\" His eyes watered, his mouth burned, and his face turned  _  . He coughed and choked and gasped for breath. But despite his  _  , he continued to stuff the fruits into his mouth! Onlookers  _  their heads and laughed. One man yelled: \"You're  _  , man! Those are chilies! People use them as a condiment . You don't just eat them by the handful like that; they're not fruit!\" But the man replied: \"No, I can't  _  ! I paid money for them, and now I'll eat them. It's my money!\" You probably think this man was pretty  _  , right? Nevertheless, I bet you or someone you know makes the same  _  on a daily basis. People invest money, time and effort into a relationship, business or job. Even when experience tells them that it's not  _  , and they know there's little hope of improvement, they still  _  because they don't want to waste the previous investment. But this is  _  . It is no different than being the man who continued eating chilies because he didn't want to waste the money he'd paid for them. Losing something is difficult, but it is important to  _  the loss and move on.  _  you'll just keep burning your mouth on hot chilies.",
