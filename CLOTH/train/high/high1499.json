In our first game of the season, we were   _  to face a good team, all of whom were tall guys.\nNaturally, at my  _  , it would have been easy to be  _  by our competitors.\n    On game day, my basketball coach called me over to him. He was a strong and tough coach, and in his   _  rough\nmanner said, \"Joel, you're not that  _  , but let me\ntell you that size doesn't matter. Don't be afraid. What  _  is right down in here.\" He pointed his finger at his  _  as he continued, \"Joel, you've got a big heart, and you're to  _  it this year.\"\n    When I heard the coach's    _  ,\nI stood taller than usual! I thought to myself: The coach believes in me! My\nconfidence  built up  and I played better that year than\nI'd ever done before.\n    It's    _  what we can\nachieve when we know somebody really believes in us. That coach took a little\ntime to make a big  _  . He took time to make me\nconfident in myself. If we're going to  bring out  the\nbest in people, we need to sow seeds of   _  .\n    As the saying goes, \"Love looks for a way of being constructive.\"   In other words  , love looks for ways to help\nimprove somebody else's life.\n    When people are    _  us,\nthey should leave better off than they were before. People should feel  _  and inspired after spending any time with you and me  rather than  feeling discouraged or defeated.\n    Remember, there's    _  greater\ninvestment in life than in being a people builder. Relationships   _  much more to us than our\nachievements.",
