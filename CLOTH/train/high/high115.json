Mobile phones are a great  _  to stay connected with friends and family.  _  , it is important to remember that there are certain times  _  you should not be using your phone, especially as a student, during school.  _  you are in class, you should not be sending your friends text messages  or  taking phone calls. Your classmates and teacher should not have to deal with this rude  _  . Aren't you at school to learn? In the United States, students would never be allowed to  _  their mobile phones during class. If you were to send or  _  a text message you would probably be kicked  out of  class. It is very disturbing to hear a lot of tones and ringing during  _  . There are many more rules for mobile phone use in America and it is to  _  respect for those around you. As a teacher in China, I have to  deal with  students using mobile phones every day.
