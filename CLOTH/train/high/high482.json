Then I'll   _   for a bit in the classroom to participate in the morning activities. I'm more than   _   to do this, because it's the   _   thing to do.\nThe U.S Department of Education has collected the results of numerous studies pointing to how   _   it is for dads to be involved in their children's   _  . Here are just a few:\nDads model how grown men behave in life. When talking to my son about his   _  , I often point to how I and my male friends conduct ourselves illustrating how we use our words instead of our hands to   _  , and treat other people with respect and kindness. This has come to make a big impresion on him. It's important for kids to see grown men behaving   _   and carrying themselves with dignity, because they   _   our every move.\nAlso, dads encourage kids to take   _   and explore. Kids with active fathers tend to be highly   _   about the world. A dad's involvement seems to give kids more confidence in exploring the world around them.\nBesides, kids learn about how men and   _   interact with one another by watching their dads. It makes a great impact on kids when dads   _   help around the house and treat the child's mother with love and   _  . This helps break down rigid,   _   gender stereotypes  .\nWhether you're a   _   in New York State or not, any day is a good day to take your child to   _  . Beyond that, ask your child about what they're learning in school. Get involved! Your child will   benefit from   it, and really, so will you.",
