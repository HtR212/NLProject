But    _  , none of this is true.\nThis is a man who does not spend hours at home participating in all kinds of activities.   _   , this is a man who comes home every evening to eat and then to sit in front of the Tv for the rest of the evening. He spends his weekends doing nothing but   _   Tv or visit with friends. Do you think he has time available?\nHe has the time available if he choose to   _   it. However, he chooses to waste it.
