    "article": "A few weeks ago, I was sitting in the window seat of the super-crowded ladies' compartment in a train to Mumbai. I'd been   _  to find a seat because I had got in at the first station. In a few minutes, the seats were all  _  , and many other people had to stand in the jam-packed aisles .\nOne of them was a little girl. It was  _  that she was used to the crowd, since she knew how to  _  her position to the one that was the most  _  . I felt a little uneasy sitting there watching her having to stand.\nI knew what I should do.   _  , I had to overcome some internal  _  before I could do anything. \"Would I look foolish trying to help her?\" I wondered. Then I thought, \"Maybe this sort of thing is quite  _  , and nobody would think the worse of me if I did not do anything.\" My  _  continued, \"Am I thinking too much of the whole thing?\"  _  , I felt a little shy just reaching out. But I told myself, \"Well,  _  you are thinking about it, go the whole way.\" So, a minute later, I  _  the child and asked her to sit on my lap for the rest of the  _  ride. Though I54 _ a bit while offering it to her, the surprised and delighted   _  on the child's face was enough to  56 _ all my doubts away. And then, I began to think instead, \"Why hadn't I offered it to her even earlier? What was  57 _ me?\"\nSomehow, the gift of gratitude she given me was far beyond the slight discomfort. It was difficult to say who was doing the giving. She was so  _  that she sat at the very edge of my knee, supporting half her  _  so that there was less on me and my legs wouldn't hurt. I felt glad that I'd finally done the  _  thing.",
