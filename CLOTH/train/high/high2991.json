He loved the tree and the tree loved to   _   with him. \nTime went by --- the boy had grown up and he   no longer   played around the tree. One day, the boy came back to the tree and he looked   _     .\"Come and play with me,\" the tree asked the boy. \"I'm no longer a kid. I  _  play around the tree any more.\"the boy  _  . \"I want toys. I need   _  to buy them.\" \"Sorry, I don't have money. But you can   _   all my apples and sell them. So, you will have money.\" The boy picked all the apples on the tree and left   _  . The boy never came back after he picked the apples. The tree was sad.\nAfter that the boy returned and asked the tree for   _   again and again. First, he asked the tree for a house, and the tree gave the boy all its   _  . Second, he told the tree he needed a   _  to go sailing, the tree offered its trunk.  _  , the boy returned after he left for so many years. \"Sorry, my boy. But I don't have   _  for you any more. The only thing left is my dying   _  ,\" the tree said with tears.\n\"Good! Old tree root is the   _   place to lean on and rest\". The boy sat down and the tree was glad and smiled with tears.\nThis is a story of everyone. The tree is like our parents. When we were46 _ ,we loved to play with Mom and Dad... When we grow up,we 47 _ them,and 48 _ come to them when we need something or when we are 49 in trouble . No matter what,parents will always give everything they could to make us happy. We may think that the boy is 50 _ to the tree but that's how all of us are treating our parents.",
