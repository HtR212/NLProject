    "article": "Years ago, I had the opportunity to conduct a seminar. This was a motivational one basically designed to  _  people in changing their lives,  breaking through  their personal barriers in life.\nIt was always  _  to meet the seminar attendees. Some of them couldn't wait to get started, others were  _  about what they would get for their money, and others attended  _  often being forced by pressure.\nThis last group was always the most  _  to work with. They sit there with  _  crossed, rarely participating in any of the specific exercises meant to help them build positive behaviors to  _  old habits and thoughts.\nIn the end, I started to look through the evaluations paying particular attention to find the form submitted by one of the attendees who had seemingly  _  less attentiveness. To my disappointment, in this  _  , there was no form. I left that day thinking that I had  _  this person.\nAs I  went about  my preparation for the next seminar afterwards, one day I received a phone call --it was the  _  attendee who had not submitted the evaluation form! My immediate  _  was to prepare for a request for a total refund .\nIt was not the case,  _  . He took his time to tell me how much the seminar had already helped him change his ways, and how much more comfortable he was with himself now that he knew how to overcome his own personal barriers  _  success both personally and professionally. I was surprised and glad to be  _  to him.\nActually we all have power to affect the  _  of others, but this power can also be negative if you use it wrongly or improperly. Power -- you all have it -- use it  _  because you never know what impact you have on other people even when you think  _  .",
