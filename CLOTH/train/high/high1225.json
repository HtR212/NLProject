Their conversation always  _   on the things they hoped to achieve and they loved to talk about them.\nThis particular Saturday when they met for lunch, WHEN   _   IF wasn't in a great mood . After they sat at the usual table  _   for them, WHEN asked IF, \"You don't seem your usual   _  self?\" IF replied,\"Yesterday I saw a course I wanted to take, If only I   _   the time.\"\nWHEN knew exactly how IF felt and said, \"I too saw a   _   and I' m going to register   when I get   _  money.\" WHEN then questioned IF, \"what about the new job you were going to apply for?\" IF answered, \"I would have applied, but my   _   broke down. I couldn't type my resume .\"\n\"Don't worry. I've been thinking about looking for another job also,   _  I'll wait and when the weather gets   _   I will do it then. I hate this awful weather.\"\nThe man sitting nearby heard them talking about when this and if that. When he couldn't   _   it anymore, he went to them and said, \"I think I know   _   you could solve your problems.\"\nIF smiled and thought that even if he knew the   _   they faced, there was no way he could help!   _  , IF asked the man for advice. The man said, \"Your conversation reminds me of an old   _  : IF and WHEN were planted, and nothing   _  .\"\nIF and WHEN both looked surprised and began to feel   _   of living their life for the \"ifs\" and \"whens\". Finally they came to a(n)   _  : next time they met, there would be no \"ifs\" or \"whens\"; they would   _   talk about what they had   _  !",
