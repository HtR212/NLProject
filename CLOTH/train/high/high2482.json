    "article": "Having a son as a woman who has only really been around women can be a strange experience. I sometimes tell my husband that raising our 3-year-old boy  feels like  someone dropped me off on another planet where I didn't know the  _  and had no map. My son makes me laugh like no other, but his desires and interests sometimes do feel as  _  to me as another galaxy . He has taught me so much about the bigger man in my life (my husband) and even more about  _  in general. When I get mad at my husband now, I look at our son and  _  . He was once as sweet and precious as my son, even if he is so  _  now. My mother-in-law's attitude used to be confusing to me, but now I kind of  _  it. I love my son violently. If some woman ever  _  him, she'd be punished for that.  _  my daughter can't find something, she searches. But my son is  _  calling, \"Mommy! Daddy! Where is my toy?\" It's so much like my husband. He will also spend 0.1 seconds  _  before calling out to me and  _  where the butter, cheese, or coat is. My son has taught me it's a male thing.  _  , that doesn't mean I won't break of it. I  _  will. Isn't that what all moms say? My husband showers every day on most  _  days. But on the weekends or on vacation? Forget it. Now I understand that. My son hates bath time and  _  the whole time. I have to fight with him and reward him to get  _  . Nothing is sweeter for a mom than her baby boy. My son and daughter are equally  _  to me, but in a different way. He tells me he loves me and how  _  I am. I wish I could bottle that sweetness and  _  it for the teen years.",
