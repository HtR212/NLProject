    "article": "David grew up poor. He started working in the 7th grade and by high school he was only going to school half days,  _  at 11 am to go to work. Lack of money meant lack of educational opportunities, but he had a  _  to learn. In his spare time he read books that he thought would  _  him succeed somewhere down the road. He was a hard worker, and rose above his  _  of higher education to provide for his family,  _  factory life had a bad effect on him physically, emotionally and  _  . It was, in his mind, killing him like a slow poison. In 1995 he bought his first computer and a few months later discovered the Internet. He wanted to be a part of it, and worked 48 or  _  hours a week in the factory, and worked another 40 or more hours a week  _  himself computer skills. He worked harder than he  _  had in his life, surfing the Internet over 100 hours a week. David began  applying for  jobs in the Internet and computer fields. He was  turned down  many times, but he never gave up. He had a goal and kept after it  even when  he didn't feel like it because  _  else seemed so hopeless. That kind of drive and perseverance almost always  pays off  . David left the factory and took a job in the computing field. This is a true story about  _  , a story about believing in  _  ; a story about finding what you love to do and  _  your dreams. My hope in writing this story is that, if you have a dream, you'll be  _  enough to see it through . It's up to you to  _  it. Remember that even the farthest  _  always starts with the first step.",
