    "article": "Starting a new book is a risk, just like falling in love. You have to  _  to it. You open the pages knowing a little bit about it, maybe from the back or from a blurb on the front. But who  _  , right? Those bits and pieces aren't always right. Sometimes people  _  themselves as one thing and then when you get deep into it you realize that they're something completely different. Either there was some good marketing  _  to a terrible book, or the story was only explained in a(n)  _  way and once you reach the middle of the book, you realize there's so much more to this book than anyone could ever have told you. You start off slow. The story is beginning to  _  . You're unsure. It's a big commitment reading this tome . Maybe this book won't be that great but you'll feel  _  about putting it down. Maybe it'll be so awful you'll set it down immediately and never pick it up again. Or maybe you'll come back to it some night, drunk or lonely--needing something to  _  the time, but it won't be any better than it was when you first started reading it. Maybe you're  worn out  . You've read tons of books before. Maybe you've taken some time off from reading because the last few books you read just weren't  _  it. Do they even write new, great works of literature anymore? Maybe it's a once in a lifetime feeling and you're never going to find it again. Or something  _  could happen. Maybe this will become your new favorite book. There's always a possibility, right? That's the  _  of risk. You  _  your time and your brain power in the words and what you get back is a new understanding and pure wonder. How could someone possibly know you like this? Some stranger, some author, some character. It's like they're seeing inside your  _  . This book existed inside some book store, on a shelf, maybe handled by other people and really it was just  _  for you to pick it up. It was waiting to speak to you. To say, \"You are not  _  .\" You just want more of the story. You want to keep reading, maybe everything this author has ever  _  . You wish it would never end. The closer it gets to the smaller side of the pages, the  _  you read, wanting to savor it all. This book is now one of your favorites forever. You will always wish you could go back to  _  having read it and pick it up fresh again, but also you know you're better for having this close, inside you,  _  your heart and mind. Reading a book is just like falling in love. Once you get in deep enough, you know you could never put this book down.",
