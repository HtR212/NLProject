There, I saw a telephone and I liked it very much.   _  lovingly up at my mother, I asked, \"Mama, can I have that telephone?\" She replied, \"Baby, not now.\" \"But Mama, I want it.\" She was a little   _   and said, \"Nora, you can't have that telephone today.\"   _   we were waiting to pay for the things we had bought, I   lay down  on the ground and began screaming, \"I want it.\" Other people looked but my mother calmly said, \"Nora, you'd better get up by the   _   of three or else. One ... two ... three ... \"I didn't stop. Then she lay down   _  me on the floor, and began kicking and screaming, \"I want a new car. I want a new house ... I want ...\"  _  , I stood up. \"Mama, stop. Mama, get up,\" I tearfully said. She stood up, and many people began to clap. Her face turned   _   and she said   _  to others. People said to me, \"Your mom got you   _  . Never try that again.\" And I didn't. I would never forget that experience.",
