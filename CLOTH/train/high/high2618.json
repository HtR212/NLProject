    "article": "I always think my spoken English is so poor that I can't communicate with native English speakers well. So after going to the college, I take as  _  English lessons as I can.  As long as  I am free, I go to English corners and  _  English lessons and lectures. To my surprise, I can understand most of  _  of the professors who come from Canada, and the USA. However, I haven't had more  _  to talk to them in English. Although I  _  English articles out aloud every day, I am not sure if I can make myself  _  by native English speakers. How I hope I can talk to  _  English speakers for a while. I went to the English  _  as usual last night. Surprisingly, there were three foreigners sitting there. There , however, were several Chinese students around them, too. \"I must not  _  this chance,\" I said to myself. \"Hi, nice to meet you.\" I  _  to one of them. \"Nice to meet you too.\" He put out his hand. We  _  hands, what a warm hand! Then I  _  myself to him. When I told him that I had  _  English by myself for three years, he said that it was  _  and my English was so good. His words gave me a lot of  _  . At that time he hadn't had dinner. He asked us if it was rude or  _  to talk to us while he was eating (a)  _  . We, said we didn't  _  that, only if he was  _  to talk to us. He smiled and began to eat his supper.",
