    "article": "In a hall crowded with audience, a famous professor started his lecture by holding up aPS10 note.He asked, \"  _  is this piece of paper and is it worth\nanything?\" \"It's aPS10 note, which can be   _     in markets for its value.\" replied one of the many participants who  _  their hands.\nThe speaker continued to crumple   the PS10 note using both his   _  until it became\na piece of wrinkled  paper.He then   _  it again and made an unsuccessful attempt\nto keep it  _   ,asking, \"Does any one of you want\nit?\"\n         \"Yes!\" replied the participants.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"it looks that I haven't done   _  ! What\nif I do this?\" And he  _  it on the ground and\nstarted to grind  it into the floor with his shoe.He   picked up  the note, and\nit was now all crumpled, dirty and not easy to  _  from\na distance.\"Now would someone still like to   _  it for its\nvalue?'' Many hands went in the  _  .\"I think that piece of currency is still holding its value,\"   _     a participant.\"This bill can still get   _  worthPS10.\" said another participant.Everyone agreed.\n\"My friend, there is a very valuable lesson in what we were just   _  with.It might appear to some of you that I was able to change the PS10 note during the process,   _  no matter what I did to this note, you still believe that my actions did\nnot actually  _  its value It was still a\ncurrency note worthPS10\".\nMany times in our life, we are dropped and crumpled by the   _  we\nmake or the circumstances that come our way.We feel as though we are  _  .But whatever has happened or what will happen, please remember you never lose your   _  ,\nyou are still precious to those who love you.",
