This is not because children's eyes are too sharp to allow any blot(,)to pass without being  _  , but because adults have too many conflicting concerns to keep their eyes open to all wrongdoing. Not long before, an examination, intended to  _  some police officers to higher positions, was held in Gansu province. Someone  came up  with a good idea that 18 primary pupils could be invited to act as invigilators . At that age, students would do as they are told and act fearlessly.  _  , they caught 25 officers cheating on the spot, which has caused a stir (,) and  _  the question of whether adult invigilators would  _  their duties as well. The implication of this event goes  _  its impact on the work style of local police officers and the examinations. Most people said what these children have done points to the sad fact of  _  being less trustworthy. If adults acted as invigilators, they would quite  _  turn a blind eye to cheating. We Chinese have been holding the  _  that human nature was good at birth: as  _  of blot as a sheet of blank paper, which can be  _  with content (good or bad) in the process of growing up. Everything should be done on the basis of certain principles .  _  , nowadays the repeated reports of cheating in examinations, selling ranks and  _  and embezzling public funds paint a  _  picture of common social morals. Adults have become too concerned with their own personal gains to  care about  basic sense of principles. When no one  _  any principle and the only concern is personal interest, everyone will  _  , not only those who first break the rules. Besides, cheats are unfair to honest examinees, and when the success of cheats  _  more people to cheat, the consequences will be disastrous. In a word, we adults need to have our eyes as  _  as children's on matters of principle.",
