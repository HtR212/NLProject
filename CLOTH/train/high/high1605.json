    "article": "My mom died when I was two years old. She died in an accident when  _  to visit her parents. I was in the backseat, and I wasn't  _  .I don't remember anything about her. The only few things I know are from the  _  my dad tells me. I  grew up  with only my dad and myself. I love my dad, but sometimes it was  _  , like being in elementary school when Mothers' day was coming, kids would decorate cards, and so on. To make it  _  , there was\"Tea party with mom \"day for 2ndand 3rdgrade when kids and their  _  would come during the school day and have  _  and snacks. Except that my dad would let me  _  those days, we would do something  _  together like going to Disneyland. I never exactly felt  left out  even though I didn't have a mom.\nMy dad worked very hard. My mom died right as he  _  from Harvard law, and he tried to be both a good  _  and a great dad, but also he tried to play both  _  as dad and mom. I remember all the other girls in my 2ndgrade class had hair braided  , and I  _  that too. So my dad would braid my hair every morning before  _  . It makes me smile just to  think about  it.\nI think about not having mother occasionally, and  _  it does bother me ,like the  _  that on Mothers' day my dad and I visit my moms' grave , and bring her  _  yellow roses .\nMaybe I don't have exactly what I want, but I have what I need.",
