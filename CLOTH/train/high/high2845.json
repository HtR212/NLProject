    "article": "Many years ago I drove a taxi for extra money. I drove mainly from the downtown to the  _  , beside the Greenwood Racetrack which was in operation at that time. Each time a taxi drove up to the station, many kids would run along the  _  to the passenger door. One  _  kid would open the passenger door and say, \"  Good luck  , sir.\" The passenger would always say thanks and give the kid a  _  on his way from the taxi to the entrance of the track. It was a routine that everybody knew. One day I noticed a boy, who was  _  than most of them but was pushed away by even the smallest kid. He never pushed back.  In fact  , he would even step aside when others pushed forward. But he never  gave up  . Then one morning as I was  pulling up  to the sidewalk, all the other kids were running after a taxi  in front of  mine. They didn't notice mine. The boy saw me and walked toward my taxi. As I pulled up I made sure that I stopped in a  _  with the passenger door right beside him. He  _  the passenger door with a flourish and said, \"Good luck at the track, sir.\"  _  , the man did not tip him a quarter. Instead he  _  , \"Get out of my way!\" He pushed him aside so  _  that the boy fell on the sidewalk and I knew he was badly hurt. I got out of my car quickly  only to  find that the man disappeared in the crowd. So I looked for the kid. I decided to give him $20 for all his  _  . But he was far up ahead, walking out of the station  _  . The traffic policeman waved at me to get my car going.  From then on  , I never saw him again. I'd like to find him one day and tell him that if only he had stuck around a little longer I would have given him a whole $20. I learned an important lesson from the boy. When things seem so  _  that you are ready to give up, that is the time when things are most likely to turn around for you.",
