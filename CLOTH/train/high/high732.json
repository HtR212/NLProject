While I was chatting to my grandmother about my busy day, my sister  _  us, wanting to know if we, too, could smell burning.\nAs my parents were overseas, the thought of a  _  terrified us and we quickly checked every room in the house.  _  the kitchen, I could see a glowing light and hear a roaring sound. To my  _  , the stove was on fire and smoke was blowing out of the window. I yelled to my sister and grandmother to  get out of  the house. My sister grabbed the  phone  to call the fire brigade   and, together with the dog, we ran away from the house.\nWhile we  _  waited for help, a lady and her young daughter ran towards us to  _  if we were hurt. She had noticed smoke coming from our window and had already  _  the fire brigade. She hugged us and was very delighted to see us  _  .\nShe led us to her car where we waited  _  the fire was put out. She also helped us answer questions so the police could start their investigations.\nOnce the lady was  _  that some order had been restored, she apologized for being  _  to stay longer, as she had to take her daughter to a dance performance.

We thanked her very much and  _  her not to  _  any further.\nHours later, we were allowed back into the house. It was about midnight when the doorbell rang.
