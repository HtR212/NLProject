A friend of mine\nonce told me of  _  along a one-lane , unpaved mountain road.  _  was another car that produced clouds of choking   _  , and it was a long way to the nearest  _  highway. Suddenly, at a  _  place,\nthe car ahead pulled off the road.  _  that its owner\nmight have engine trouble, my friend stopped and asked if anything was wrong. \"  _  ,\" said the other driver. \"But you've stood my dust this\nfar; I'll  put up  with yours the rest of the way.\"\n    Another element of courtesy is empathy , a  _  that makes\nit possible for a person to see into the mind or heart of someone else, to understand\nthe pain or  _  there and to do something to reduce it.\nA man  _  alone in a restaurant was trying to unscrew the cap of a beer bottle,   _  he couldn't do it because of badly injured  _  . He asked a young waiter to help him. The waiter took the bottle, turned\nhis back  _  and loosened the cap without\ndifficulty. Then he  _  it again. Turning back to the man, he  _  to make great efforts to open the bottle without success.  _  he took it into the kitchen and returned shortly, saying that he had\nmanaged to loosen it --but only with a pair of pliers . \nYet another element of politeness is the ability to treat all people  _  , in spite of all status or importance.  _  when you have doubts about some people, act as if they are worth\nyour best manners. You may also be astonished to find out that they really are.\nCourtesy is the key to a happier world.",
