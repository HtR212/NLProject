She was  _  , so she often told me, \"Study hard. Your  _  will pay off. You will have a good  _  in life.\" When she graduated, she got accepted to a university.  _  in the university for about a year, she ended up leaving there, because she didn't have enough   _  for the next year. But a year later, she  went back  . This time she was not only a college student, but also a(n)  _  . She had to work in her  _  time and do homework during school hours. It must have been her most  _  period of time. Instead, she told me how to become  _  .\nI  _  her and often tell myself that I should work hard to  _  it once I set my mind to something like Angela. Her ways are changing my ways. Now I don't do the things I  _  to do. Ever since I started high school, I have been more   _  to my study. I am not lazy any more. I have  _  everything aside and just have been studying hard. I am really  _  that she has changed me a lot.\nAs our teacher was  _  , I already had something to write, because I  _  thought of my cousin. I am actually proud to say that she is my  _  , because I wouldn't be here at this point of time without her help. I firmly believe that I will be someone who  _  someone else one day.",
