He told me   _   that his business was just fine, but the cost of gas was really hurting his bottom line. We then   entered into   a spirited discussion and got around to discussing the job environment.\nHe told me that he had difficulty getting another type of work because of his   _  .\"I am a former criminal,\" he said   _  ,\"People look at my record and then I'm done,\" he complained.\"I know I messed up but I've turned my life   _  and have been clean for several years\", he went on to explain quietly and without   _  \"It is never   _   to start a new life, \"I said,   _   the critical thing is that you are starting and that you have options.\" The driver seemed to be   _   as he looked back at me from the front seat. \"Like what kind of options?\" He asked. \"If you don't want to drive a taxi for the rest of your life, then you can make a   _   to go back to school, even part-time, so you can   _   for a trade or some other occupation you are interested in.\" I replied.\nLater, as I said goodbye to the driver, I felt a moment of pain for him. But, at the same time, the driver is like a lot of other people I have met over the years--only   _   is that they are not former criminals. They are still in a type of prison each day of the week. These are people who already have good jobs and good reputations but are totally   _   with their lives. The daily   _   they go to is one where work is   _  , where each day is full of worry wishing for something better. This is a prison of the   _  .\nIf these words   _   your daily life, know that there is always an opportunity to   _   your life if you set your sights on a higher level and take action towards it. The decision is yours and yours   _  .",
