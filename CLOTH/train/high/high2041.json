I add to the letter photos and report cards that would have   _   as the year passed.\nI have a small   _   in which I keep the things that I want to send my daughter. Every week, I   _   short notes of what I can think of from the week's events. When her birthday approaches, I   take out   that box and find it full of beautiful cards and   _   memories.\n  _   the letter is written and all the treasures are put into the envelope, I seal   it. It then becomes that year's   _   letter. On the envelope I always write: A letter to Ann from Daddy - to be opened when you're twenty-one years old. It is a gift of   _   from Dad to her daughter. It is a lasting   _   of her life written as she was actually living it.\nThat tradition of   _   her birthday letters is now one of my duties. As Ann grows   _   , I can see that it is a growing and   _   part of he life, too. One day, we were talking about life in the   _  . It went like this: I jokingly told Ann that on her 61st birthday, she will be   _   with her grandchildren and having fun with them; on her 31st birthday, she will be taking her own kids to school; on her 21st birthday, she will be   graduating from   university and will be offered a good job soon. \" No,\" she said, \" I will be too busy   _   .\"\nOne of my greatest   _   is to be alive and present to   _   that wonderful time in the future when those letters are   _   and the accumulated  love walks into her life.",
