    "article": "The snow is gone and green grass can be seen growing close to the sunny side of homes. The birds in the back yard are singing in the bush. Spring is here, and with  _  come memories of the smell of  _  , new sneakers, and longer days.\nAs a kid, I knew spring arrived when I walked into the house after school and  _  paint. The first warm day would cause my mum to have the idea of  _  . She opened the windows, let the fresh air in, opened a can of paint, and put a fresh  _  on the walls of a room.\nSpring was also the time to change  _  . In Nova Scotia, we had snow on the ground almost  _  from late December until late March. We spent all of our time outside wearing our  _  winter boots. To run in them was like running with two weighty bags.\nIn late April or early May, mum would take us to the town to buy a new pair of light  _  for each of us. I still remember the rubber  _  , with the trademark imprinted on it. After a month or two, small hands would tear it off, and leave a circle, darker than the  _  material around it.\nLater, when we returned home, my brothers and I  put on  our new sneakers. The door shut  _  behind us when we rushed out, causing a shout of  _  from our dad. Then we ran across the fields. The weight of the heavy winter boots was  _  . It felt like we were  _  through the air or we could jump thirty feet like a kangaroo. The thoughts of summer's approach and the  _  wind of spring rushing past our uncovered ears were  _  .\nWhen life gets me down; when everything seems  _  ; I don't let it  _  me. I would let my room put on a new coat of paint, pull on a new pair of sneakers, and just run like it was spring.",
