    "article": "A while ago, I made a photo journey across the United States by bus. During this   _  , I ended up in Seattle where I  _   Laddie McCrea.Laddie, you see, was a hobo . He was about 60 years old but   _   like 100. When I first met Laddie, he was standing on the side of a   _   street greeting every person   passing by   with a smile,a pleasant greeting and an extended palm . Each day, people   _   past Laddie--either not noticing that he was there or   _   him -- a smelly hobo.\nI found Laddie to be a(n)   _   character for my photo journey, so I paid him to allow me to stad in the background and   _   him. I spent three days   _   somewhere, and photographing Laddie. Most of the time he didn't know where I was. Each  _   he stood in a busy place of town   _   the world with a smile,just to earn some money for a meal.\nOne  _  day,as I watched from a bench off in the distance, a young girl, around six or seven,came to Laddie and   _   him something. Laddie was   _   about it. He reached in his pocket and gave the girl some thing. The girl ran back to her parents   _   showing them what she had   _   .I was so curious about the   _   that I went to Laddie immediately and asked him what happened.\nLaddie  _  :\"The little girl came to me and gave me a coin, so I gave her two in return   _   I wanted to show her that when you are generous, you will receive more than you give\"",
