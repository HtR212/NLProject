    "article": "One year ago, I traveled 15,000 kilometers from Australia to the US. I am from a beachside town in the  _  of Sydney, and thought there would be almost no  _  differences between my home country and my  destination  . I was surprised at how wrong I was, and at  _  different the two countries could be. The United States is  _  in almost every aspect. The buildings are gigantic and so are the people who  _  and work in them. At mealtimes, the portions often  _  to me to be big enough for three or four people. I once  _  a baked potato which turned out to be bigger than my head! This was a big  _  for me. The longer I spent in the US, the more I started to  _  smaller differences like the culture of  _  in restaurants. In Australia we don't tend to give a tip  _  the service has been really excellent. In the US you tip for  _  everything, even at the hairdresser. Waiters and shop assistants  _  to be given 15 percent of the bill, although in places  _  New York or Washington DC, a tip can be as much as 20 percent.  _  , I also became more wary of believing the stereotypes I had heard at home as I traveled. Not all Americans are ignorant of geography, for example.Despite this, certain stereotypes about places did seem to  _  true for me. There is an immense sense of speed in New York. Everyone  _  to and fro, and very seldom takes time to  reflect on  the moment. This is very different from the Australian lifestyle. Australians are laid back. Even in a major city like Sydney, we \"Aussies\" take time to \"stop and smell the roses\"--very different from our American counterparts. Navigating the culture divide between Australia and the US was challenging at times. But I took up that  _  and learned a lot from it. It was an adventure.",
