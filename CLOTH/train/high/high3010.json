    "article": "It was my first college acting class. With great hesitation, sweating hands and an  _  heart,1 walked into the classroom. I had spent my entire life  _  public speaking. But now here l was,  _  not only to learn how to speak like someone on  _  .but to become them entirely. Theater classes are  _  at many high schools and universities in the US. \"Theater kids\" are a quite different bunch who always seemed able to  light up  a room with their personalities.\n  _  it was only a beginner-level course, my college class was filled with students who seemed a  _  fit for acting. They were confident, funny and  _  .The professor, a stout woman with a permanent smile and gentle behavior,  _  just as well, She  _  us each with a handshake and welcoming eyes. The class was held in a circular room with  _  situated around the edges. This allowed everyone in the room to have a(n)  _  of whatever performance or lecture was  _  in the center.\nAfter our first-day of introductions, each week we  _  in a series of activities designed to help us find our own inner  _  .We sang songs, danced to music, and recited  _  from our favorite short stories.\nThe  _  was eye opening .I learned that anyone has the  _  to act, and many of us already do in our daily life. In the end, I'm not  _  that l would consider myself an actor. But I don't think I ever had more fun in a college class.",
