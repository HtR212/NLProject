    "article": "Recently a Russian friend came to visit me. It was one of her lifelong dreams to visit London. She   _   at lunchtime and we   _   a tiring afternoon going round the Tower of London.   _  , by 5 o'clock I couldn't help   _   that she didn't seem as enthusiastic as she had been   _  . I asked if   _   was wrong and she said, \"This is all very interesting but where is the   _   and where are the men in bowler hats  ? Why did everyone   _   to get on the bus at the bus stop instead of making a queue? It's very   _   from the books I've read about England.\"\nHer   _   made me think. It's true that people don't   _   much any more: nowadays you often find that everyone just jumps on the bus. Or maybe this is only in London. Also the idea of a man standing up and offering his   _   to a woman on a train or bus is   _   these days, although my father still does it!\nSpeaking of the   _  : well, we all know that a hundred years ago there used to be fog all year round in London, but we   no longer   have much fog; nowadays we have pollution from all the cars! Over the last few years in   _   London had been one of the hottest places in Europe, although we still get more than enough rain in the season.\nWhat about the city men in their working \"uniform\" ? Well, you can still see some city gentlemen in their smart   _  , but men hardly ever   _   bowler hats. A few things don't   _  , though. If you try to   _   a conversation with an English person on the underground in London, she or he will probably look at you as if you were mad!",
