    "article": "When I started riding a bike a couple of years ago, I didn't think my involvement  would ever be more serious than sometimes short rides. But as I built up  _  , my friends encouraged me to try some  _  trips. The\nfirst one to come along was a 150-mile ride, an annual  _  that\nraises money to fight cancer.\nWhen I registered, the idea seemed excellent - to support a  _  cause while riding for a long\ndistance. But  _  the time for the ride approached, my\nself-doubt gained ground   _  my determination.\nAs a matter of fact, though I  _  want to raise money for the\ncharity, I didn't really want to bike all those miles for two days  _  .\nThe ride began on a Sunday morning, and for the first few hours I felt wonderful. This was just the experience I had imagined, and my spirits were high. But by the end of the day, I felt tired and  _  .\nIf the body is connected to the mind, here is proof in action.\nEvery  _  my brain pushed\nout seemed to travel right down to my legs. \"I can't  _  this\",\n\"I've got a cramp \", and \"everyone else is a better rider\"  _  into shortness of breath. I was sure I'd have to quit.\nThen I  _  that the lone\nrider in front of me looked different  in some ways  . But she was too\nfar away for me to  _  why. And so I pushed myself to  catch up  . There she was, riding along slowly but  _  ,\nwith a slight and determined smile on her face and she had only one leg.\nMy  _  changed in that\ninstant. For a whole day I'd been  _  my body. But now I knew\nit was the  _  that would help me reach my goal.\nIt rained all the second day. But I pushed on without complaining. And at the end of the day, still feeling strong, I completed the 150-mile trip.",
