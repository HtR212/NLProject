    "article": "Sometimes, people are required to fill in personal information when they register online, which may lead to some  _  trouble. Recently, the BBC is reporting that a 17-year-old girl in Australia posted a(n)  _  of her grandmother at home counting a large sum of cash that she  _  hidden in the house. Just eight hours later, two armed men  broke into  the girl's house. They demanded to speak to her to find out where the grandmother's house was,  so that  they could get the money they had seen.  _  , the girl was not home at the time, so the robbers  _  a small amount of cash from the mother and left.\nBecause the  _  is still under  _  , local police aren't saying much else about it. It's not known yet whether the girl had used privacy setting on the Facebook profile page, and even whether the robbers  _   the girl in the past.\nTwo other  _  were at home then, a 58-year-old man and a 14-year-old boy, the girl's father and brother. Luckily, no one was  _  . The robbers left peacefully after  _  that the girl was not home and that no one else there knew anything about the  _  that had appeared in the photo.\nPolice in both Britain and Australia are using the case to  _  citizens of the dangers of posting personal information on social networks and to suggest users of websites  _  doing so. The police say it is  _  that the girl posted a comment in the past that gave clues to the address,  _  that the robbers knew the girl in another way.  _  , they suggest, a posting by a friend on their site could have  given away  such information. To find it, the robbers would only have had to search for those posting on other pages that contained the girl's name.",
