    "article": "On a farm in the southeast of England lived a farmer. Gradually, the farmer became fed up with this farm; and no wonder, you'll say, for he was born on the place, he had   _   all his days on it.\n    He was sick and   _   of the surroundings. He wanted a   _  ; and often in his dreams, he 44 _  a quiet spot where conditions were ideal, and where he could spend his old age in comfort and be   _  . He told the real estate agent in town how he felt, so the   _   drove out and looked the   _   over carefully. He felt sure he would have no difficulty in 48 _  a buyer.\n    When the weekly paper came out, the old farmer   looked over   the advertisements, and found his farm   _  . It stated that the Hammond place of 160 acres was   for sale  . The land was fertile and productive -- a crop failure had   _   been known. 40 acres were   _   with a lot of trees and the farm had a good supply of water all the year round. There was rich agricultural land, through which flowed a small stream and there was a   _   and modern house of eight rooms.\n    The farm had a great many horses, cows, sheep, and chickens. It was close to the   _   -- only a half hour's drive, and had a telephone. There were all kinds of fruit trees, both large and small, with an abundance of   _   around the house.\n    The old man read the 57 _  a second time, and then drove to town to   _   the real estate agent. \"I have read that advertisement,\" he said, \"  _   as nearly as I can figure out, that's exactly the kind of place I have been   _  . I think I will keep it myself.\"",
