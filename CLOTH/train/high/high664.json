I was walking to catch a train home, totally 36 _  in the next day's to-do list, not paying any attention to my surroundings. \"Hey man, I love your nice hat!\", said a voice to me from the sidewalk. When I 37 looked back  to see where it came from, I saw a man 38 _  dressed, carrying a garbage bag, standing outside a 39 _  --with a warm smile on his face. As I was about to say thank you, a woman walked by. \"Hey lady, you have the most beautiful eyes. Can you 40 _  some change?\"\nThis homeless man had no 41 _  of talking to anyone and he was excellent at 42 _  up others. I felt pulled to help him use that 43 _ . I introduced myself, and 44 _  him to dinner inside. \"Ralph's the name. Thank you so much, sir!\", he said.\nAs we sat down and ate, I told Ralph that I felt he has an amazing talent for 45 _  with people. 46 _  at first, he eventually began to open up. He spoke much about how he used to love to 47 _ . He was like a fisherman's encyclopedia  . I asked him what he could see himself doing, and he said that he thought he could be a good 48 _ . So I asked him if he ever 49 _  going to the store right down the street and telling them he would help them sell their fishing equipment. There was a pause.\nRalph put his hands over his face 50 _  he spoke through tears. I'll never 51 _  what he said next. \"I 52 ran away from  my problems, man. I had a job and a family. 53 _ , I didn't know how to handle everything. For 11 years, no one has ever done anything like this for me. It's time for me to make things 54 _  again. \"\nBy the end, I was in 55 _  as well. Ralph thanked me for my help, and we went our separate ways.",
