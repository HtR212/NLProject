    "article": "In 1883,an engineer named John Roebling intended to build a bridge connecting New York with the Long Island.  _  ,experts throughout the world thought it impossible and not  _  . Roebling couldn't  _  the vision in his mind of this bridge. He knew deep in his heart it could be done. He just had to  _  the dream with someone else. After much persuasion he managed to  _  his son Washington,a young engineer,that the bridge  in fact  could be built. Working together,the father and son developed concepts of  _  it could be accomplished and how the difficulties could be  _  . With great  _  and inspiration,they hired their crew and began to build their dream bridge. The project started well,but unfortunately an accident took the life of John. Washington was injured and left with a brain damage,  resulting in  him not being able to walk or talk or even move. Everyone had a  _  comment to make and felt the project should be trashed. In  _  of his disability,Washington still had a burning  _  to complete the bridge and his mind was still as  _  as ever. He tried to pass on his  _  to some of his friends. Suddenly an idea  _  him as he lay in hospital. All he could do was move one finger and he decided to make the best  _  of it. By moving this,he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife. He used the method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. It seemed foolish  _  the project was under way again. For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm,until the Brooklyn Bridge was finally completed. Perhaps this is one of the best examples of a never-say-die  _  that overcomes a terrible physical handicap and  _  an impossible goal.",
