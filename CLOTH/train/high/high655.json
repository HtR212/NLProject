    "article": "I arrived late one night, on a business trip, and had dinner in a restaurant. As I was finishing my meal, an old couple came in to dine. They were holding hands and had  _  smiles on their faces. Shortly after I ended a 20-year  _  , I still had pain in my heart and I was  _  at the love they show for one another. As a result, when I paid my bill I gave the waiter another $50 to pay the couple's bill and then left without  _  them. The next day my business meeting  _  two hours before the flight back to Houston. So I had enough time left to enter the restaurant to dine  _  . After I had been  _  , the waiter, from the night before, came up to my table  _  . She can't wait to tell me what happened after I  _  last night: when the old couple were  _  that another guest had paid for them, they asked whom it was. The waiter said that she had never  _  me before, and told them what I told her, \"I just wanted to repay  _  for the true love that they were showing.\" Feeling surprised , they  looked around  , and paid the bills for another two young couples saying \"Love begets love\". I  _  with delight and said \" That's nice\". Then I read the menu and  _  my meal. When my dinner was  _  and I intended to pay, my waiter was  _  to be found. I had to walk over to the Hostess Stand and  _  that I needed to pay for my meal and hurry to the  _  . She said that my  _  had paid for me just to repay the joy that I brought to the faces of the elderly couple and the amazement of the two young couples.",
