Tears welled up in my eyes whenever I was alone.\nLast month I   _   a precious watch, which was an 18-year-old birthday gift from my father. I could not fall asleep for a couple of nights because I felt   _  about the loss.\nThere have been many   _   like these in my life. I could never figure out how to deal with such tough things   _   I read \"If You Have a Lemon, Make a Lemonade \" by American writer Dale Carnegie.\n\"When the wise man is handed a lemon, he says, 'What   _   can I get from this? How can I   _   my situation? How can I turn this lemon into a lemonade'\" he wrote.\nI suddenly   _   that life is full of ups and downs, so I need to stay   _   all the time. Now when I think of my past, I wish I could have handled things   _  . When my mother was fighting for   _  , I should have held her hands in mine, telling her things would get better instead of   _  and crying.\nSeveral weeks ago, I took part in a campus singing competition.

I was happy that at least I had got some stage   _  .\nLife is not just a bed of roses. There are thorns as well, but these thorns help us become   _  and strong. When life   _  us a lemon, let's try to make a lemonade.",
