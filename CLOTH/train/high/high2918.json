As her   _  swung between what she was going to do with her life and their dinner plans for the evening, she was unexpectedly   _  by an urgent call from her sister \"Get over here! Turn on NBC and check these guys out. They are just like you.....\" One facebook message and a phone interview later, Jane   _  herself on a bus with 8 strangers in the middle of the sweltering  desert heat of Utah, picking up trash and   _   awareness about zero-waste and climate change.\nWith a deep   _   of the environment and a desire to make a   _  , Jane, Davey, and a group of self   _   \"environmental pick-up artists\" went on a coast to coast road side trash pick-up. As they walked, sometimes only   _  0.9 miles in an entire day, they   _   and steadily made their way across the United States for three years, picking up a total of 201,678 pounds of trash.\nJane and Davey   _   with us wonderful stories of hope and inspiration that fueled their   _  to continue their journey. After spending weeks silently   worrying about  how she would have enough   _   to fly home for their two-week spring break, Jane found a blank, unidentified envelope   _  with $850 cash in the desert. Just enough to get her home and back. After their bus   broke down   outside of Denver, they unexpectedly got   _  and arrived in Yosemite National Park three weeks later, just in time for the \"Yosemite Facelift\" where   _  from all over the state came together with a   _  of cleaning up trash all over the park.\nBeing at the right place at the right time became almost normal, and they realized that much of what they   _  was more than just a coincidence. Together, their team learned to simply   _   themselves to their task, and surrender to the journey.",
