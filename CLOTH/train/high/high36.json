We'll remember it forever. We took any job that we could      _  and saved each penny. We   _   the money every day to see how much we had got. We talked about how   _   the poor family would be when they had the money. The day before Christmas we   _   all our coins for three $20 bills and one $10 bill. We felt we were very rich.\nThen came the exciting Christmas morning. However, later that afternoon the minister   brought us a(n)  _  .
