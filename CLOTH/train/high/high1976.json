We can only make a  _  , of course, but we can be sure that he will be  different from  what he is today. For man is slowly changing all the time.\nLet us take an obvious  _  . Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now on  _  , men are about three inches taller. Five hundred years is relatively a short period of time, so we may imagine that man will continue to grow  _  .\nAgain, in the modern world we use our  _  a great deal. Even so, we still make use of only about 20% of the brain's capacity . As time  _  on, however, we shall have to use our brains  more and more  --and eventually we shall need  _  ones! This is  _  to bring about a physical change too:the head, in particular the forehead, will grow larger.\nNowadays our eyes are in  _  use. In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a very long period of time it is likely that man's eyes will grow  _  .\nOn the other hand, we tend to make less use of our arms and legs, These, as  a result  , are likely to grow weaker. At the same time,   _  , our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a great  _  in modern life.\nBut what about hair? This will probably  _  from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both sexes are likely to be bald !\nPerhaps all this gives the  _  that future man will not be a very attractive creature to look at! This may well be true. All the same,   in spite of  all these changes, future man will still have a lot in  _  with us. He will still be a human being, with thoughts and emotions similar to our own.",
