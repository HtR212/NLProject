    "article": "The Power of Fresh Starts\nThirty years ago, I began my first year of teaching in Grade 2. One of the most   _   students was a little boy who had a serious ADD . I had no   _   in dealing with such a case, and I   _   the year studying how to help him become a successful   _  . There were many disappointing moments, but there was something pleasant about the boy who moved excitedly around my classroom.\n  _   the end of the school year came near, I heard a talk. The Grade 3 teachers were   _   of having Stephen the following year. I considered it a lot, and I   _   that I would be the best  person to follow Stephen into Grade 3. My headmaster looked at me in   _   , but he agreed to my plan.\nI will never forget that day when Stephen came to ask   _   he was in my class again. I looked at him in the eye and said, \"Well, Stephen, you're in my class because I asked for you.\" The little boy looked surprised. \"You did? Why? \" he asked. \"Because I like you and want to keep   _   you,\" I answered. \nStephen just stared at me. After a few moments, he   _   and walked back to his seat with satisfaction. We never spoke of it again, but the two of us had many surprising learning breakthroughs  that year. I believe those   _   were more of a result of Stephen's knowing that I had put his previous year's mistakes behind him.\nNow I come to know that when I   _   for one, I can improve his soul. Each season is a new beginning, a new way of thinking. Many students   hope for   a new start and are determined to act upon it. We need to pay attention to even the   _   sign that students are looking for help.",
