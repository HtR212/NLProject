Through the years I would think about  _  I thought was the right answer.\nWhen I was  _  , I thought sound was very important to us, so I said, \"My  _  Mommy.\" She said,\"No, Many people are  _  . But you keep  thinking about  it and I will ask you later\"\nSeveral years passed before she asked me again. This time I told her,\"Mom, if there is  _  important to us, it must be our eyes.\" She looked at me and said,\"You are learning  _  but the answer is not right because there are many people who are blind.\"\nOver the years, Mother asked me a few more times and  _  her answer was, \"No, but you are getting  _  every year, my child.\"\nLast year, my Grandpa  _  . Everybody was crying. Mom looked at me when it was our turn to say our  _  good-bye to Grandpa. She asked me,\"Do you know what the most important body part is  _  , my dear?\" I was  _  when she asked me this now. I always thought this was a  _  between her and me. She saw the puzzlement on my face and told me,\"This question is very important. It shows that you have really lived your life.\" I saw  _  well up in her eyes . She said,\"The answer is your shoulder.\"I asked,\"Is it because it  _  up my head?\" She replied,\"No, it is because it can hold up a  _  head when he or she is crying. Everybody needs a shoulder to cry on  sometimes  in life, I only hope that you have enough friends who will give you a shoulder to cry on when you need it. Only Then did I know what the most important body part is not a  _  one. It is sympathetic  to the  _  of others.",
