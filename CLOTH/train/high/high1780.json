    "article": "Years ago I had the opportunity to meet a girl who strengthened my understanding of the power of belief. She was  _  the most powerful individual I had ever met. I met Chris for the first time while taking the Dale Carnegie  _  in California. Our class had already been going for quite some time when  _  , supported by metal crutches ,  _  herself in. Chris had cerebral palsy . She had much  _  in communicating with others. This was not due to  _  of desire, but because most of her twenty-one years of life she had been kept in a room with no more than Elvis records and tapes to  _  her. No one had taken the time to assist her in developing the ability to  _  . It was Bonnie, her present caretaker, who  _  there was much more to Chris than anyone else could see. When asked by the instructor what her goal  _  the twelve-week course was, Chris struggled to respond and became frustrated and  _  in the process. For most of her  _  nobody would listen to her. The only way she knew to get someone to  _  was through temper outbursts . With Bonnie as her interpreter, Chris conveyed that her  _  was to be able to stand by herself in front of forty-five people and tell us about herself. On the twelfth week, Chris stood in front of the room and  _  with us, in her own words, what her life had been like. It was one of the most beautiful and enlightening experiences I had ever  _  . Though as a girl who had in many ways been  thrown away  , she believed that she could  _  more in her life and she did. And she also had the love and support of forty-five friends, who, just weeks before, had been  _  strangers. What we all witnessed through Chris' courage is that life is  _  moment by moment, based on our beliefs, which are relevant to both our personal and professional direction and have the power to make our wildest dreams come true.",
