    "article": "One very cold and rainy night in the winter of 2012, my husband and I were in a fast food restaurant. We were about to begin our meal  _  a man walked in. He was completely  _  from the rain and went into the men's room. I watched him go by, then I said to my husband, \"That man must have had nothing to eat in a long time.\" When the man came out of the men's room, he just  _  himself in a chair, not going anywhere near the food counter. I  _  that he didn't have any money for food and  _  wanted to dry off for a while. I just couldn't eat my food knowing that someone else was sitting  _  only a few tables away. So, I  _  a $20.00 bill from my shopping money to my husband. \"Please get him dinner,\" I said. \"We can do with less money this week.\" My husband  _  the man and quietly asked if he needed some food. The man  _  at us. \"A small cup of coffee would be great,\" he said. \"Thank you so much!\" He  _  wasn't going to take advantage of us, but we  _  that he should have a full meal, which he gratefully  _  . After he  _  the food, he thanked my husband and my husband said, \"No. Thank my  _  . She noticed that you were  in need  .\" The man asked me, \"  _  did you know I haven't eaten in a long time?\" I smiled at him and said nothing , just asking him to  _  the change from the $20.00. Giving others a  _  whenever they're in trouble not only brings happiness to the ones who  _  it but also to the ones who give it. I am so grateful that I was able to  _  with someone truly in need. It is a little bit of extra warmth on a rainy day.",
