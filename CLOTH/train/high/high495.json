    "article": "It was the afternoon when we closed on our new house, and I was in the garage  . I   _   a part of blanket sticking out of the ceiling; that was   _  . I pulled on it, and a way to the attic   suddenly   _  . I climbed a ladder and headed up.\nI climbed into a space   _   the garage that was separated from the rest of the attic. As my eyes adjusted   to the dark, I saw a metal container that I   _   as a World War II ammo   box; my grandfather used to store   _  used on his farm in this ammo boxes. I opened the cover and was   _   at what I saw: a lot of money   _   up in orange rope. God, I've found, like $800!\nBut there was more than one box of   _  . I found another seven boxes   _   to the edge, plus two big black dustbin bags full of money.   In all  , about $45,000. In my attic, I won't lie, my first   _   was that this was a   _   from God--the money to   _   this old house and to make life   _   for our two young sons. But I   _   that the right thing I should do was to   _   the money to the former owners. So I called them and asked them to come.\nThey were  _  , of course, not only about the money but that I was returning it. They had recently   _   over the house and said it must have been their dad who had   _   the money.",
