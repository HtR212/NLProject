I walked towards the small area where the English corner is held, in fact  _  in front of our dorm   building.\n\"Nice to meet you, Miss. I'm Tom.\" His nice  _  attracted me. I turned and saw a tall and good-looking boy. I was about to tell him my  _  when the others came, saying hello to the boy. Tom  _  the group. Our  _  changed from sports to music.  _  by the wide range   of his knowledge, I could not help   _   what a well-educated person he was.\nOur  _  moved on. I noticed that Tom  _  one topic after another, but that he didn't do all the   _  . He listened quietly and was  _  enough to let others finish what they wanted to say. He was different from  _  who used the English corner to show off . I didn't  listen to  what he said, but just looked at him. Before I  _  it, the other people had  _  , and it was just Tom and I standing there.\nI took a deep breath and looked at Tom in the eye. I  _  he was the person I had been waiting for. When we parted he said, \"I hope I'll  _  you again soon.\" But that didn't happen.\nI was very busy with my studies. However,  _  , standing in the summer heat, I look towards the place, and think about Tom and the  _  we met. Although he will never  _  again, he will always be in my mind.",
