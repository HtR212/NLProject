    "article": "On the Iraq-Syria border, a pack of wild dogs circled a group of American soldiers for food. The  _  of the pack was a gray-and-white dog. The soldiers  _  him Nubs. Nubs was shaking and  _  able to stand. Marine major Brian Dennis looked closer and saw that there was a knife wound  _  his chest. Dennis couldn't  _  seeing the dog suffer. He and his men immediately treated the wound, and gave Nubs oral medicine. Nubs pulled through but was still  in pain  . The next day, the team had to leave. Ten days later, Dennis's unit was back and so was Nubs. He was still  _  , but the men fed him and played with him. Before long the unit once again  left for  an outpost 70 miles away. Nubs, slowly but  _  tracked them far into the trackless wasteland until the men lost  _  of him. Two days later, beyond Dennis's  _  , he saw Nubs just outside the outpost. The dog had  _  him across 70 miles of frozen desert to meet the friend who had saved his life. From then on Nubs and the men slept in the same place, and ran around in the same ruins. Until a(n)  _  came down from above that they should not be allowed to have pets, Dennis decided to make sure the dog  _  continue to live the good life. So he quickly  _  $4,000 from his family and friends to fly Nubs to  _  . A month later, when Dennis and the dog were  _  in California, at first Nubs didn't recognize the guy.  _  within seconds , the dog flew into Dennis's arms,  _  up again and again to lick his friend's face. A little care and concern in the middle of war will not save a  _  world. But small stories, like the story of a soldier and a dog, hold a promise of a harmonious world.",
