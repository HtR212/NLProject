So he placed a very large   _   in the center of the main road into town. Then he   _   behind a tree and waited. Soon an old man came along with his cow.\n\"  _   put this stone in the center of the road?\" said the old man, but he did not try to   _   the stone. Instead, with some   _   he passed around the stone and   _   on his way. Another man came along and did the   _   thing; then another came, and another. All of them   _   about the stone in the center of the road,   _   not one of them tried to remove it. Late in the   _  , a young man came along. He saw the stone and said, \"The night will be very   _  . Some neighbor will come along later in the dark and will   _   against the stone.\"\nThe young man then   _   to move the stone. He pushed and pulled with all his   _   to move it to one side. But imagine his   _   when under the stone he found a bag full of   _   and this message: \"This money is for the   _   person who removes this stone from the road. That person   _   help.\"\nTherefore, never walk away from someone who deserves help; your hand is God's hand for that person. When we all treat each other with   _  , we live better together, we work better together, we cooperate. Sure, there will always be fools, but if we can make them a minority, society will be better on a whole.",
