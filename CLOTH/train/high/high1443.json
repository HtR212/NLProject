Suddenly he heard loud breathing behind him. \"Man, that's a big dog!\" he thought. He looked to the side, but to his great  _  , he saw that it wasn't a dog, but a wolf, running hard to   catch up with  him.\nMac's heart jumped. He reached for the  _  from his bag. With one hand on the handle bar, he  _  the spray. A bright red cloud covered the wolf  in time  , and it fell back, shaking its head. But a minute later it was by his side again. He sprayed a second time, and the wolf fell  _  gain, but only to quickly restart its   _  .\nThe wolf was getting closer and closer,  _  a dozen yards away. Mac waved and yelled at passing motorists, but meanwhile  _  hard. He knew clearly that he must be  _  not to slow down. Otherwise, he would become a  _  of the wolf.\nPaul and Becky were driving along the same road. From a distance, they spotted what they  _  was a dog running after a man on a bike.

Mac  _  off his bike and dashed for the back  _  of the car. It was locked. Paul quickly  _  the door so as to let Mac in, and the   _   man dived in, shutting the door behind him.\nIt was quite a while before Mac became  _  and cried out: \"I thought I was going to die!\" And Paul and Becky were glad that they had given a helping hand to people in need.",
