There was always too much sugar, too little ice, or not enough milk. However, I  _  working at this coffee shop.\nOne day, one of my  _  customers came in, looking depressed and defeated. I asked what the  _  was and if I could help, but the customer wouldn't say any details. He just said that he felt like lying on the bed,  _  the sheets up over his head, and staying there for a few years. I knew exactly  _  he felt. Before he left, I handed him a bag with his coffee. He looked at me  _  because he hadn't ordered anything but the coffee. He opened the bag and saw that I had given him his favorite cookies. \"It's on me.\" I told him.\nThe next day that customer came again.  Instead of  ordering anything, he   _  me a pink rose and a thank-you note saying that not too many people took the time to care about  _  and that he was  _  there were still people like me in the world.\nAs time went on, I came across many  _  customers. But anytime I felt  _  , I thought of that little  _  . Then I would smile, hold my head up high, clear my  _  and ask politely, \"How can I help you?\"",
