My mother   _   herself to bringing me and my siblings  up.\nAs a child I was hyperactive and   _   in school. I wouldn't listen to anyone and thought I   _   everything. At home, I was always breaking things and   _  everyone. Dad was worried, so when I was eight, he took me to boxing classes in an   _   to divert  my energy and keep me out of trouble. It made a huge   _   to the way I saw life and taught me discipline. It also taught me respect, because Dad made it clear that if I didn't   _   properly, I wouldn't be able to go back to the gym.   _   it hadn't been for him, there is no doubt I'd have just   _   my life.\nDad was surprised when people at the gym started saying that I had the   _   to be a champion. His   _   had been to keep me off the streets, not to make me a world-class boxer. But he was so proud,   _   when I won a silver medal in the 2004 Olympics. I was only 17 and I know Mum and Dad were   _   for me because I was just a boy, yet I was fighting men.\nI don't have to   worry about   the business side of my career, because Dad oversees all that. He deals with the lawyers, making sure my fight contracts are all up to date and   _   properly.\nDad's always at the ringside during my   _  --his main priority is that I'm safe. Mum   _   coming when the fights got harder, because she couldn't bear to see the blood. She'll   _   sit at home or in the hotel, waiting until it's all over.\nThe boxing world can be a very lonely one, and I'm so   _   every day to have Dad and my whole family behind me. It would be unthinkable if I didn't have their   _  .",
