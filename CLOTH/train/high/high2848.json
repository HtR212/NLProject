    "article": "Valentine's Day is known worldwide as a time to celebrate love and romance. But the holiday is also notorious  for reminding many singles that they are    _  of a significant other.\nInstead of feeling sad and   left out  , many Chinese singles decided to join each other in a crusade against the love birds -- proof that the singles are not   _  in the festival after all.\nHere is some advice posted online by some love-starved online activists on   _   to ruin Valentine's Day for those enjoying romantic   _  :\nBuy up the odd-numbered   _   for movies so the lovers can't sit together.\nBook up all   _   rooms in hotels so the lovers will have no place to spend the night.\n  _   chocolate and puncture  condoms in supermarkets.\nWalk up to a couple on the street,   _   either of them in the face and crying out \"How could you   _   on me?!\" (Better if this happens between the same sex).\nTake a part-time job to deliver flowers and throw half the bouquets   _  .\nSome of the strategies have been put into practice. Sina Weibo user @Yanta   _   one photo showing him (or her) slipping Dear John letters into boxes of chocolate in a supermarket. The other photo shows one of the letters   _   \"let's break   _  . The chocolate will be my last   _   for you.\"\nA cafe in Luzhou, Sichuan province announced proudly in its Weibo   _   that couples are not welcome on Valentine's Day, singles will be   _   a 10 percent discount in the shop.\n  Even so  , the strategies above are not supported by all. \"Just think about it. How would you feel when you find the chocolate you bought for a girl is   _   or your wife has to have an abortion  due to condoms with holes? Won't it be dangerous to slap a stranger on street?\" a netizen   _   calling on people to avoid a possible violent way.",
