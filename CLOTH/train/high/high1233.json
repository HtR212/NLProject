Being a student from a  _  family, I had to work on weekends to make some extra money that my family couldn't really  _  to give me, and one day after work I lost my wallet. My old car  _  gas in the back. I paid for the gas and then put my wallet on the bumper ,and drove off. I hadn't even had time to  _  it when my phone rang and an old man asked me  _  I had lost my wallet. I checked the  _  of my jacket and to my horror, I had. He asked me to tell him how much money was  _  it, and I told him. He then told me where to  pick up  my wallet. As I drove into his driveway, I  _  that his car was for the  _  . I was thinking that there was no way this man could  _  get out of hid car and get my wallet off the  _  . He had to pull over,  _  in his wheelchair, lower the lift, and then pick it up, I was  _  . I knocked on the  _  and he told me to come in. I thanked him like 10 times for  _  my wallet. While I didn't want to make him angry by offering him  _  , I really felt like offering something. So I asked him if there was anything I could do to repay his  _  , and he said, \"Just pass  _  on.\" I really wanted to thank him, so I  _  promised I would.",
