I worked in a  _  doctor's office and this was one of those days when the unexpected happened, making the schedule run  _  than usual.It seemed I was going to be late  _  home and my husband, being the  _  person, would be ready to pronounce me late once again. Maybe  _  I hurried, I could still make it home. I was heading inside to  _  for my gas when I noticed an older couple at the counter, I heard them asking for  _  to the local hospital.It was the same hospital that I had just  _  a few minutes ago. The young man at the counter was trying to be  _  in explaining how to get there, with two other people making  _  .One of them was  _  trying to give them a whole different route back.It was then that I walked over to the couple and said, \"Would you like to follow me to the  _  ?\" A look of  _  crossed the woman's face. \"I'm going right by there,\" I said, which wasn't a( an)  _  since I had just made up my mind to do  _  that. I got in my car and began the journey back.I was trying to watch to be sure they were right  _  me.I took only fifteen minutes to get there as rush hour traffic was beginning to  die down  .I felt better than I had all day and my headache was  _  gone. Later, as I arrived home, my husband teased, \"So you aren't ever late any more.\" \"Sometimes it's  _  to be late,\" I said, happy inside my heart.",
