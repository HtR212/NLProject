    "article": "Once upon a time there lived an old man in a nice cottage with a large garden. The old man was seen  _  his flowers all the time. They were so well-tended that every passer-by could not but  _  for a glance. One day a young man went by the garden. He gazed at the splendid garden,  _  in admiration at the beauty of these sceneries. Then, suddenly he  _  the old gardener was blind.  _  , the young man asked, \"Why are you busy tending these flowers every day which you can't  _  in fact?\" The old man smiled and answered that \" I can tell you  _  reasons. First I was a  _  when I was young, and I really like this job. Second, although I can't see these flowers, yet I can  _  them. Third,I can smell sweetness of them. As to the last one, that's  _  . \"Me? But you don't know me,\" responded the young man  in surprise  . \"Yeah, it's  true  that I don't know you. But I know everyone knows flowers and would never  _  them down. I know the beauty of my garden will get many people into a good  _  . In the meantime, it also  _  a chance to me to have a word with you here and to enjoy the happiness these flowers have brought us.\" The old man's  _  astonished me. The blind man grows flowers and  _  them as a link of minds so as to make  _  enjoy the sunshine in spring. Isn't it one kind of happiness? I believe every flower has  _  with which they can see the kindness of the man's heart. The blind man grows flowers in his heart. Though  _  to see the beauty of blossoming, he surely can hear the voice of it, I suppose.",
