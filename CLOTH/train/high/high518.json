As with any   _  , the cross-country team has its \"stars\" as well as its less   _   athletes. Ethan, Michael (8th grade) and Kenji (7th grade) are the   _   runners for the boys. Yesterday was the first track meet of the season, and when she got home, my daughter told me a story that made me   _  .\nAccording to my daughter, one of the new 6th graders is a boy named Albert. He is apparently \"a little short and 41 _ \" and has never played any   _   races before. The 6th graders ran last, three laps   around the school. 43 _  in the race, Albert was dead last. All of the other racers were   _   the race when he was just at the end of his second lap. Albert thought he was   _   near the end. But quickly the poor kid realized that he had another whole lap left to run. He broke down and started   _  .\nWhen Ethan, Michael, and Kenji saw Albert in a   _   mood in the middle of the field, they didn't even   _  . All three of them immediately went out on the field to run Albert's last lap   _   him. Everyone knew that was   _   the rules in cross country, yet they all remained   _  . Both other teams hung around and waited for Albert to finish. When he managed to   _   the finish line, all three schools cheered for him.\nAfter my daughter told me this sweet story I said, \"I hope Albert doesn't   _   the team after this.\" She replied, \"No! He'll get better, he just needs some   _  .\"\nAnd that is why I   _   middle school children.",
