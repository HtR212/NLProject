A young man, wet from  _  to foot, explained that he had run out of petrol and had left his wife and two children behind in his car.\nAfter I had  _  a can with petrol, I drove him back to his car. Once his car had started, I suggested he  follow  me. Back to the gas station, I turned on the heater so that it is nice and  _  . While the young man was drying his wet clothes, the little ones played and ran around. I prepared bread for the children and hot coffee for the  _  . Before they left, the young man asked me how much he owed me and I told him that the petrol pump   had  _  $15. He offered to pay \"call-out fee\", but I wouldnt accept it.\nAbout a month  _  , I received a  _  from a large bus company.  _  turned out that the young man was its general manager, the most  _  person in the company. In his letter, he thanked me again and  _  me that, from then on, all their buses would be filled with petrol at my station.  _  his case, a little kindness was rewarded with a huge benefit.",
