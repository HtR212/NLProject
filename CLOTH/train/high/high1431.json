    "article": "I couldn't quite summon up   the power of positive thinking Monday. I would be tied up in meetings the next two days and I was having serious doubts  _  I'd be able to get everything done for the June issue deadline Thursday. At home Monday night, I sat down on my sofa with my  _  after dinner and went back to work, virtually. I finished  _  the last story for June, read it  _  and hit save. \"Now I can breathe a little easier\", I thought, feeling some of my  _  return.\nI clicked over to my email to  _  the story to Keren, our copy chief, so she'd have it first in the  _  . Only I couldn't. I'd  _  my Internet connection. My digital cable modem, which  _  has four blinking green lights, was unfavorably dark. I called the cable company's 24-hour helpline. The technician tried several different ways to  _  my modem remotely. Still nothing. \"I have to  _  you to a higher level of technical assistance,\" he said, \"and I'll give you the  _  appointment available Friday afternoon.\" No  _  for four days! There went my positive attitude.\nMore than I thought, as it turned out. Sure, I had to  _  longer hours at the office since I couldn't wrap up things from home. But when I left work, I could just  sit back  and relax at home. I watched TV without feeling  _  to catch up on emails or my coworkers' blogs during advertising time.  Instead of  wandering the web and losing track of hours and hours, over those four days I made dinner from the very beginning, finished reading a(n)  _  , and even wrote some long overdue thank-you notes. I wouldn't have if my modem hadn't  _  . Being disconnected from the Internet  _  made me feel more connected with what I was doing in the moment.",
