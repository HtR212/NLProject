    "article": "It is often said that politeness costs nothing. In fact,  _   hearing the phrase \"thank you\" or \"well done\" means the same to employees as a modest pay   _  , researchers say.\nPraise and encouragement also   _   employees more likely to work hard and stay in their jobs, saving on the cost of finding   _  .\nA third of 1,000 workers   _   said they did not get thanked at all when they did well,and a(n)   _   third said they were not thanked enough.\nIn both  _  , the employees said they felt   _  , meaning they were less likely to be  _   to their jobs and were more likely to look for employment elsewhere.\nAccording to the survey, praising employees has the same   _   as a 1 percent pay rise, and works out much   cheaper   for bosses.\nThree out of four employees said that regular   _   by their bosses was important to them,   _   only a quarter said they were actually given as much praise   _   they felt they needed. Those doing manual jobs were less likely to be given any   _   for doing well.\nScottish employees felt   most   undervalued, eight out of ten saying they would like more praise. However, workers in the northeast are less   _   by being buttered up by the boss, as only 69 percent said they felt the   _   to be told \"well done\" regularly.\nThe research found that words of praise did more than   _   a pleasant place to work--they could   _   increase profits.",
