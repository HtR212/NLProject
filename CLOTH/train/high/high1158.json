    "article": "The secret of success is what you say not what you think. Several years ago, I started representing a new service in the  _  . I started out like a wildfire and within  _  a few days I had reached stardom within the company. About a year into it. I started to work with a young lady who always said the most  _  and defeating things I'd ever heard in my life.  _  , I found myself repeating the very same defeatism , which  resulted in  my sales dropping and my shining stardom fading away, and I couldn't understand  _  . At first, I  _  myself to say negative things about  _  , and then after some  _  , the tables turned and I began to  _  those things about myself. Before long, I had  _  myself into being a failure. Did it happen  _  ? No, it snuck its way into my life; little by little. I'm sure you're  _  what I did to get out of that hole that I dug for myself. I started to talk myself back into being  _  ; I printed lists of  _  things to say about myself, most of which was the exact  _  of what I felt about myself at the time. In order to achieve anything in life, you have to  _  believe that you can achieve it; in order to believe that you can achieve you have to think it's possible; in order to think it's possible you have to tell yourself it is. Yes, it will take time for you to get to a place where you finally believe you can accomplish what you set out to achieve, but the first person you have to  _  is yourself. I dare you to write positive things down about yourself and start saying them to yourself every morning, at lunch and just before you go to bed for the next 30 days and see for yourself the  _  that it can make. You have nothing to  _  except the negative and that wouldn't be such a bad thing.",
