I don't   _   what you want.\" This hit home for me because at the time, I was in difficult negotiations with my ten-year-old daughter   _   one. And frankly, she was winning. CK added, \"I'm not raising the   _  --- I'm raising the grown-ups that they're going to be. So just   _   the other stupid kids have phones doesn't mean that my kid has to be stupid, or   _   she'll feel weird.\" OK, I was sold. \nCell phones are \"toxic, especially for kids,\" he said, because they don't help them learn empathy, one of the nicer human   _  . When we text, the   _   we get is in cold, hard text-speak. Why are kids   _  ? he asked. \"Because they're trying it out. They look at another kid and go. 'You're fat.' Then they find the kid's unhappy, and they think, Ooh, that doesn't feel   _  .\" There, they've experienced empathy. Texting \"you're fat\" allows you to bypass the pain you've caused.\nCK went on to explain to us that smartphones rob us of our ability to be   _  . Kids use smartphones to   _   their time: Must text! Must play game! Must look up more tiny American Girl socks online for Molly!!! After all, one of the joys of being human is allowing our minds to  _  . With cell phones, kids are always preoccupied. They never daydream,   _   in class. And here's something else we're   _   out on thanks to Steve Jobs's little device: our right to be    _  . This was a right I hadn't realized I desired until CK pointed out that it's yet another of the essential human emotions. \n\"Everybody's murdering each other with their cars\" as they text, CK screamed, because they fear being alone. Too bad --they're missing out on a life affirming experience.\n\"I was in my car one time, and Bruce Springsteen's 'Jungleland' came on,\" he said. \"And he sounds so far away. It made me really sad. And I think, OK, I've got to get the phone and write hi to 50 people. I was   _   for the phone, and I thought, Don't! Just be sad.\" So CK   _   over and allowed himself to sob like a little girl   _   that brand-new four-poster bed for her American Girl doll. \"It was beautiful. You're lucky to   _   sad moments,\" he said. And because he didn't fight and push it away with that little phone, because he allowed himself to be miserable, his body released endorphins . \"And that's why I don't want to get phones for my kids.\" CK said. And I suppose I don't either.",
