    "article": "When I was young I loved taking part in high school musicals.I loved to  _  in front of hundreds of people.In one production, I auditioned like  everyone  else. My music teacher was  _  that I would get a particular part in the music drama. The part I thought I had was a  _  lead who sang some of the most beautiful love songs. But one day the show director pulled me aside. I was  _  to be offered the leading role. To my disappointment, he said, \"Bob, I found a boy with an excellent voice. I need to give the  _  to him.\" From that moment on I began hating music class. I  _  that I didn't like what we were singing. My music teacher didn't know why. She  _  me in front of the class and told me I had changed. She didn't know what I had been told. But when they  _  the finalists, I was given a  _  role. For some time my pride was  _  with having to do something I didn't think I should be doing. But I did it. The minor role I had  _  to be much more fun than I had expected. My performance even  _  my brother who was also in the audience. Life is really like a  _  and although we do not audition for the role, each of us is  _  by the director to play a certain part in it. The  _  is that we sometimes don't like the part we are given. Like me in high school I became  _  --if I couldn't be the lead, I wouldn't show up for rehearsal . Then we wonder why we feel so  _  . Sometimes we don't even feel like we are a part of the \"Big Show. \" Everyone does indeed have a role. Some are in front of the curtain, some are behind, but all are  _  for the show to go on. All  _  to success no matter how minor the part is.",
