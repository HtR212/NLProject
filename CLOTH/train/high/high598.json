    "article": "One cold night,I was growing sick of my life in San Francisco. There I was walking home around one o'clock in the morning after a  _  practice at the theatre. With the opening night only a week away, I was still learning my lines by heart.I was having  _  handling my part-time job at the bank in the daytime and my acting at night at the same time. As I walked I thought seriously about  giving up  both acting and San Francisco.I had  _  too much of city life. As 1 walked down the  _  streets under the tall buildings,I felt very small and cold, so I began  _  both to keep warm and to keep away from any possible robbers.Very few people were still out  _  a few homeless people under blankets. About a block from my  _  , I heard a sound behind me. I  _  quickly, half expecting to see someone with a knife or a gun. The street was empty.All I saw was a shining streetlight. Still,the noise had made me  _  , so I started to run faster. Not until I reached my apartment building and unlocked the door did I  figure out  what the noise had been.It had been my wallet  _  to the sidewalk. Suddenly I wasn't cold or tired any more.I ran out of the door and back to where I'd heard the noise.Although I searched the sidewalk  _  for 15 minutes,my wallet was  _  to be found. Just as 1 was about to quit the  _  , I heard the garbage truck stop to the sidewalk next to  _  .When a voice came from the inside, \"Alisa Camacho?\"I thought I was  _  .How could this man know my name? The door opened and out jumped a small blonde man with an amused look in his eyes, \"Is this  _  you're looking for?\" He asked, holding up something like a wallet. It was already 3 am. by the time I got into bed. I couldn't get much sleep,but I had got my wallet back. I also had got back some  _  of city life. I realized the city couldn't be a bad place  as long as  people were willing to help each other.",
