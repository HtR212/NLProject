    "article": "It was a dark, wet November morning. It seemed like it would take a million years to get to summer again. I thought bears have got it right - what a   _   idea to sleep through the worst part of the year and wake up when spring comes!\n\"Want some words of encouragement?\" a co-worker, seeing my mood, kindly   _  . \"You don't think they would   _   you up?\"\n\" Today ? No.\" I shook my head.\n\"I used to think so too,\" he said, \"   _  I realized the effect my words had on a certain person. Well, it was someone I knew pretty well. I have to say I   _  him rather badly.\"\n\" You ?  _   you are always so positive! How did you do that?\"\n\"I told him I did not like anything about him, really. I told him I did not   _   like his name. In fact, it wasn't only what I said. I also did pretty bad things to him. When he was hungry, I did not give him the chance to eat   _  food. When he felt like doing something fun, I said to him that having fun was not worthwhile. And worst of all, when he was sick and needed   _  , I did not care. I told him to get up and get to work. And when he did, I never told him he did good work. I was so ashamed   _   him,\" he said. \"that I wanted to   get rid of  him, but couldn't.\"\n\"But that was   _  !\"\nHe nodded. \"Then one day it all   _  . I stood there in front of the bathroom mirror in the morning. I saw the dark circles under his eyes. I saw the excess weight. I saw the long hair that needed   _  . And I saw the eyes that once had looked at the world   _  . Now they were so sad and tired. And there and then I realized he   _   better. So I told the man I had disliked for so many years that he was a good person   after all  .\"\nMy   _  dropped. I looked at him, full of positive energy, in good shape, always ready to   _  others.\n\"Wow...\"\nHe looked at me. \"So how about having a little   _  conversation with the bathroom mirror? The person in there has the greatest effect on you!\"",
