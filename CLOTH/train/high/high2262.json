Among the topic we   _   in our classes is the   _   of quality employees.\nWhat has   _   you to stay long enough to become a manager?\" I asked.\nAfter a while a new manager   _   the question and said slowly, \"It was a baseball   _  .\"\nCynthia said that she   _   to take a Circle K clerk job as an interim  job   _   she looked for something else. On her second day behind the counter, she received a   _   from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She   explained   that as a single woman,   _   was tight, and her first   _   would have to go for paying bills.\nWhen Cynthia arrived for work the   _   morning, Patricia, the store manager, handed her a box. \"I overheard you   _   to your son yesterday,\" she said, \"and I know that it is   _   to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie. I know you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't   _   good people like you as   _   as we would like to,   _   we do care, and I want you to know how   _   you are to us!\"\nThe thoughtfulness, empathy  and love of the store manager   _   that people remember more how much an employer   _   than how much he pays.",
