    "article": "I was in the fifth grade in a small town in Utah. At the start of the school year, my friends and I saw a(n)  _  face. It was clear from the start that the newcomer, Ruth, would not be  _  in our social circle. Her father lived in a neighborhood that was far from fashionable. Every day, she wore the  _  dress and too-big blue sneakers. There were lots of  _  in our school on Christmas Eve every year. Most people in town  _  the school's Christmas programmes. While other classes sang songs and performed skits, the  _  was reserved for fifth--graders. The starring roles were Mary and Joseph. One day before Christmas, my friends and I listened  _  as our teacher, Mr. Russon, read from his list. Finally, he said, \"Joseph will be  _  by Timothy.\" I was  _  ,but at once tense again. Which of the popular girls would perform with me? \"And the  _  of Mary goes to ...Ruth.\" Ruth? As far as we knew, she hadn't  _  tried out. If Ruth was going to be Mary, we decided, we'd make this the  _  Christmas play ever.  _  , Ruth had always practiced her song while the rest of us were doing  _  . Her voice cracked as she tried to get a(n)  _  . We laughed harder than ever. Our music teacher  _  the pianist. We were the worst group of fifth-graders ever, the teacher told us. This year there would be  _  play! Christmas Eve arrived. Students and people crowded the hall. Finally the time  _  for the fifth-grade performance. To our  _  , Mr. Russon said, \"One of the fifth-graders will sing a solo.\" The curtain opened, and there stood Ruth. She wore a white dress. Her face  lit up  as she began to sing. A beautiful voice rang through the hall.",
