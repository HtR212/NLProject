    "article": "I had lost many cherished pets over the years, but never in my childhood did I think I would lose a family member. One autumn morning, our family was  _  to find out that my grandfather on my Dad's side of the family had cancer. He  _  through two years of it. We did everything we could to help him enjoy a  _  stay at the hospital - we sent him videos of my soccer games and visited him often. He  _  all he could, but one November day, he passed away. At that time, my parents were visiting him in Chicago, and my other grandparents from Virginia were  _  us. Our parents came home early that visit. I still remember  _  they sat all of us down and told us the news. I felt a(n)  _  of depression, loss and  _  . I ran outside into the crisp November air and  _  silent tears. Almost a year passed, and we were eating dinner at the dinner table. A discussion started about how we could help find a  _  for cancer to save other families from  _  tragedies. My older sister Molly and I came up with the idea to sell honey from our Virginia grandparents' beehives. I came up with the name Hives for Lives and we had our business  _  ! The business started  _  taking the honey and some beeswax from the hives. We left enough for the bees to  _  through the winter. I only got stung once! Then we went through the long  _  of filtering and storing the honey.  _  it all came together, and we got down to  _  and selling our product and message. Last year, we  _  $2,000 for the American Cancer Society and all of it went to a camp for children who have cancer. This year, with a few of our friends, Molly and I  _  on selling beeswax candles and lip balm . With a lot of help, we raised $9,300! I learned many things from my grandfather, such as the importance of taking  _  and helping those around us. I know that he would be very proud of the things I'm doing today.",
