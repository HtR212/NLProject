I showed her the photos I had  _  taken with a hidden micro-camera. I told her about my best friend-Plummet-who had  _  with me. I told her how he was afraid to come to the police. She  _  again.\n\"Don't you worry, Mr. Serge. You've got nothing to  _  from us. If you can take us to this Research Lab, we will come with you  right now  and close the place down . This Dr Webber sounds very  _  . \"Her words were like music to my ears. I  _  with relief . Twenty minutes later, we were on a  _  boat, racing back across Piccadilly Lake, on our way back to the Research Lab, with six officers, all  _  with nerve guns .\nThe  _  of Dr Webber being shot with a nerve gun and arrested made me very  _  . -but I was also frightened.  _  back to that place was the last thing I wanted to do. I suddenly felt very  _  . I lay down in the back of the boat and watched the paraliders  and balloons  _  by over head. They must have banned  motor vehicles from the London sky  _  I was away.\nIt was much more  _  up there. Better than the noisy jet-cars and helicopters  that used to block out the  _  . My eyes closed and I fell asleep. I slept until I heard a voice  _  in my ear.\n\"Serge! Wake up! \"\nIt was Plummet, talking into my tiny  micro-radio. He had been  _  me from the roof of a nearby tower-block.\n\"  Hurry up  ! You're in trouble! \"",
