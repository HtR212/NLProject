Before he left for a business trip one day, he asked if she had a wish: \"I will go through the forest where you were born. What  _  should I take for the birds there?\" The bird said, \"Tell them I am full of sorrow in a cage singing my captive song and I'm cut off from all of life's sweet things. I hope it won't be long before I can fly  _  through the trees with them again.\" When the merchant reached the forest, he stopped and said, \"Dear birds!  _  to you all from my pretty bird locked in her cage. She asks for a  _  from you. She wants to join you, but I would  _  her beautiful song and cannot let her go.\" Suddenly one bird screamed and  _  to the ground. Nothing else could be more shocking. The merchant thought it was dead. He continued on to the city and  _  his goods. On returning home, the merchant said, \"I do not know what happened. I told them your message. Then, one of them fell down dead.\" Suddenly the bird  let out  a terrible scream and fell on her head to the bottom of the cage. The merchant was terrified and wept in  _  . He opened the cage door and took her into his hands carefully. The bird suddenly flew up, then out of the window and  _  on the nearest tree. She turned to him and said gratefully,\" I really appreciate your delivering my message. That bird instructed me how to  _  my freedom. All I had to do was to pretend to be dead.\"",
