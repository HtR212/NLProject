The reason is that more graduates studying in those fields end up  _  . This year, a sample of 500,000 college  _  from 2009 were surveyed and 220,000 questionnaires were received back for the 2010 report. Among the  _  majors, Law graduates had the most difficulty finding jobs, with the  _  unemployment rate of 17.7% of all the majors in 2009. English majors had the highest  _  of the unemployed for three years, with 15,700 graduates still out of work. \"Such majors as Computer, English and Law were the most  _  ones for Beijing students entering universities in 2005, but now these graduates are in a tight corner,\" said Ba ran, a senior counselor at a well-known company. Ba said that the expansion of college enrollment for those hot majors five years ago has  _  an over-supply in the market, making it harder for those graduates to find jobs. On the other side, engineering graduates majoring in Geological Engineering, Ship and Marine Engineering are  _  most in the job market. Engineering majors are more practical in professional skills and work experience, which are favored by many  _  . The graduates are thus armed with a competitive  _  in the cruel job market. The report  _  a system should be set up against majors with a high risk of  _  . Undergraduates studying Law or English are encouraged to change their  _  or obtain a second degree. For some colleges and provinces with  _  employment rates, the report advised a(n)  _  in enrollment numbers or even a temporary stop in enrolling students.",
