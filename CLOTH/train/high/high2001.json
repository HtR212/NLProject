    "article": "In the autumn of 2010, I was working at a top advertising company. I had recently been   _  as a director and it seemed I was living the American Dream. But it really wasn't. I began to   _   ill. It started with full-body pain. My   _   shifted and I went from being an energetic, happy girl, to a person my husband James didn't   _  . Something always got on my   _   and I was very confused. I found myself crying all the time without reason.\nThings went from bad to worse and I was   _   risk of losing my job. James took me to see my long-term doctor, who told me I had to go on medical   _   immediately. I fought him as if crazy, but in the end, he and James   _  .[\nI was so ashamed. I thought I had lost my mind, which I didn't want anyone to   _   . I made James promise not to tell our families and it broke his heart to have everything   hidden  . I still feel awful that I made James   _  that way, but I'm so   _   to have a partner who was willing to make such a sacrifice for me.\nI began to take days off before I got my diagnosis: fibromyalgia   and a sleep disorder --so severe    _   it forced me to wake up over two dozen times an hour! There is no cure, but both can be   _   .\nI remembered sitting in my doctor's office,   _  , \"why me?\" James and I had been married for just two years and   _   this illness was testing both of us, and testing our marriage as well. It all seemed so   _  . Just then, my doctor said, \"No one   _   you anything. You are not owed a perfect, healthy life. Anything you get in this world is a gift.   _  , stop thinking you're miserable just because life has handed you some   _  . Get over these difficulties and find a way to live.\"",
