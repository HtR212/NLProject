    "article": "Starbucks is the biggest coffee shop network in the world with more than 15,000 shops in 44 countries. It was first   _   in Seattle, Washington in 1971 by three people with just a   _   shop that sold selected coffee beans. People   _   the selected coffee beans and ground   them in the shop or carried them home. The   _   of Starbucks at the time was to sell quality coffee beans so that consumers could   _   coffee in their own houses.\nJust after 1987 Starbucks began to show significant   _   after their brand was bought by a former employee of Starbucks, Howard Schultz. He joined Starbucks in 1982 and his   _   to Milan changed his ideas about the coffee shop. Italy, a country that was famous for their coffee consuming habits, inspired Howard to bring these Italian-style coffee shops to the American   _   and the world. However, the idea was   _   by the owner of Starbucks because he believed the business of Starbucks should   _   the same. That is, they should    _   selected coffee beans, and not an Italian-style coffee shop.\nAfter   _   Starbucks in 1985, Howard Schultz set up his own shop   _   the name of IIGiomale. This name   _   was not too good. After he bought the Starbucks brand he quickly changed the name of the shop to Starbucks, and the business   turned out   to be a great success.\nPeople liked to come to Starbucks because the   _   was different and helped to release tiredness after working all   _   long. A shift in American culture was also   _   towards the Starbucks' success, because before American people liked to go to a   _   and drink alcohol. It was clear that drinking coffee was much healthier than drinking alcohol. Starbucks' success   _   to many countries, and the culture of drinking coffee has become popular all over the world.",
