I would often help do something for the neighbors to   _  a\nlittle pocket money.\nOne day I   _  on\nthe door of an elderly woman and asked  _  she\nneeded me to clean the yard. She asked why I was not in  _  and I showed her my worn  _  , which no\nlonger kept me warm. She  _  me to work in the yard.\nWhen I finished, she looked at me and said, \"I suppose you want to be  _  now.\" She then  took out  a jar (;) filled with dollar bills and said, \"I'm glad you've done a   _  job today but that is not something you\nshould be doing again. I want you to  _  new clothes\nand get back to school. I also want you to come back to  _  me\nwith your report card and I will  _  you when I\nsee you have worked hard and have some good  _  . Now\nreach out your little hands and take out as much  _  as\nyou can.\"\nI put my hands in the jar and   _  so much money that it was  _  for me to\nbuy what I badly needed. Later, I returned several times to see the woman and\nshe did just as she  _  . She looked at my report card\nand gave me a handful of dollars and some delicious food every time I  _  her that I had an \"A\".\n   I was twelve years old when I moved from that neighborhood. I will never forget the huge   _  this wonderful\nlady made over my life with her  _  . This is something\nI hope to do myself in this lifetime over and over again.",
