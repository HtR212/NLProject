This means that the bird knows the  _  between two and three.\nAnother interesting experiment showed a bird's  _  number sense. A man was trying to take a photo of a crow that had a nest in a tower, but the crow always left when she saw him coming. The bird did not  _  until the man left the tower.

It's not very good. For example, babies about fourteen months old almost always notice if something is taken away from a  _  group.
