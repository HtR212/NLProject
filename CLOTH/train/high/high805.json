After all  , it was Mother's Day and 800 miles   _   her from parents in Ohio. She had called her mother that morning to wish her a   _   Mother's Day, and her mother had mentioned how   _   the yard was now that spring had arrived. As they talked, the young woman could   _   smell the peaceful purple lilacs outside her parents' back door.\nLater, when she mentioned to her husband how she   _   those lilacs, he immediately drove her and two children to a hill   _   with purple lilacs. With a smile, the young woman buried her 48 _  in the flowers, drinking in the sweet smell. And then, she 49 _  a lilac here, another one there until her arms were full of them.\n  _     , they returned to their car for the trip home. While the kids   _   talked and the man carefully drove, the woman was surrounded by her   _  . When they were near home, they stopped at a nursing home, where an elderly   _   was sitting in her wheelchair,   _  , with head bowed and her back opposite to most of the other patients.   _  , the flowers went across to the old woman. She slowly   _   her head, and smiled.\nFor a few moments, the two women talked, and both   lit up   with happiness. As they drove back home, the kids asked, \"Mom, why did you give her our flowers?\"\nThe mother said she didn't know the old woman,   _   it was Mother's Day, and she seemed so lonely, and who wouldn't be   _   by flowers? \"Besides,\" she added, \"I have all of you, and yet she is single. That woman   _   those flowers more than I did.\"",
