He asked me for  _  , saying he needed to get to East Palo Alto. But the  _  was that he was walking the complete opposite direction!\nI  _  him in the correct direction, but warned him it was a long way off. He didn't speak English very well, and generally seemed without  _  of direction. I quickly felt like helping him.  _  he was a big guy, I got the impression that he was  _  .\nI sent him on his way, and I walked away towards my car. Just as he was going out of a short way, something in me clicked, and I offered him a  _  . He gratefully accepted, and he  _  to show me his ID. I declined, but  held out  my hand and introduced myself. He said his name was Mario.\nMario followed me to my car. When I unlocked the passenger door for him, he didn't get in  _  I assured him it was fine. As we sat in the car together, I suddenly got  _  . \"If this guy wanted, he could hurt me and take my car\", I  _  calling my brother as a safety precaution  , but then I felt determined not to feel scared.\nMario and I got into some  _  . He told me about his family in Mexico, how he works  _  doesn't ever earn enough, how he  used to  live near Fresno and work on the farms but now earns more in the Bay Area. It was good talking to him, though I couldn't shake the nervousness completely. I  _  asking him questions that would give me clues as to whether he was being truthful.\nWhen we got into East Palo Alto, I pulled into a gas station and told him it was as  _  as I could take him. He quickly got out and  _  me several times, saying he could find his way home from there.\nThinking back on it, I am glad to give a ride to Mario. Although it was  _  , I think such things should be done without fear, or not at all. I wouldn't say I'd pick up a hitchhiker again, but I know that if I did, I would make sure I could offer more love and less fear.",
