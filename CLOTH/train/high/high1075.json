    "article": "Mary was seven years old. Her parents recently moved to a new town, and so Mary was going to a  _  school, which was a few kilometers from the house they lived in now. A school bus going around picked up  _  every morning and brought them back to their  _  every afternoon, and as both of Mary's parents  _  to go to work, she always went on this bus. Mary's parents always  _  their alarm clock for seven o'clock so that none of them would be  _  . But one morning the alarm  _  to go off, and it was not until a quarter past eight that Mary's mother suddenly  woke up  , looked at the clock and said, \"What's ever happened to that clock?\" and then  _  into Mary's room to wake her up. \"I'm sorry, dear,\" she said, \"  _  you'll have to wash and dress very quickly, have an even  _  break-fast and then I'll  _  you to school on my way to the office.\" \"But how can you find the  _  , Mum?\" Mary said, \"You've been to school only once.\" \"Yes,\" her mother answered, \"but you've done the  _  several times now on the bus, so you can be my guide to get there, can't you?\" \"Oh, yes,\" said Mary, \"I suppose so.\" She washed, and  _  and had a quick breakfast, and then they set off. Mary told her mother to turn each time they came to a place she  _  . In this way she made her mother drive round most of the town  _  they got to her school. When they arrived, her mother saw that it was not really very far from her house. \"Why ever did you make me go such a long way round, Mary, instead of the most  _  way?\" her mother asked her. \"Well, Mum,\" answered Mary, \"it was because I didn't know  _  else to get here. That's the way our bus always goes to  pick up  the other children to school.",
