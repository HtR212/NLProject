It had only been two weeks since I   _  ere with my husband, but I needed a new one.\nAt the time, we lived in Houston, Texas. We only had one car, so my husband   _  me off at the passport office and told me to take Bus 82 to get back home.\nI   _  my work at the passport office and waited for Bus 82. I sat in it for an hour or so, but it didn't go anywhere near my  _  . I even told the driver where I lived, but the street was so   _  that even he didn't recognize it. So he   _  brought me back to the starting point again.\nWhen I got off the bus, it started raining heavily. I tried   _  the people around me for help, but no one knew   _  I needed to go. At that time, I didn't have a cell phone, and I couldn't   _  a pay phone.\n  _  , I came back to the bus stop where I had boarded the   _  . An old lady who was standing there   _  to hold up an umbrella for me. She even made me stand on the bench, to shield me from the water that   splashed up  from the cars speeding past us.\nThen, I asked her for help.   _  she also did not recognize my   _  , she asked me for the names of the  _  that came before and after my home. Then, she   figured out  what had gone wrong.   _  there were two Bus 82. The one that I had boarded did not go all the way to my house, but went on a different   _  . She told me that I had to change buses midway to get to my house. Then, she got me on the bus and even told the   _  to get me off after 3 stops so that I could take the correct Bus 82.\nHelp can come from any corner or person!",
