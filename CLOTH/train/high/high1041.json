    "article": "\"I don't feel right about this,\" I said to one of my cousins in a low voice. She nodded in 41 _  . Not wanting to be the first to touch the food, I waited for one of the older adults to start. \nThanksgiving usually meant 42 _   and full stomachs, however, this year was 43 _ . My family sat around the dinner table 44 _  at our feast. Everyone had a full plate, everyone except for Grandma. The treatment for throat cancer would  45 take away   one of her great pleasures, eating. This was the first of many food-focused 46 _   to come. I could not imagine what it would be like to never taste 47 _  food again. My cousin Molly broke the 48 _   with a raise of her glass, \"To Nat.\" We all followed her lead. \"Your 49 _  and strength encourage us all,\" she continued. Grandma smiled, holding back her tears with great 50 _  . \"Thank you. Please, please eat.\" And with that, we all began to eat. Conversation broke 51 _  around the room while Grandma laughed and talked with us all. Cancer would take away her ability to eat, but not the gift of being the best hostess. The evening went on as 52 _  Thanksgivings do. By the time the night was over, I felt 53 _  to my family than ever before. I learned that we gather together on holidays not to eat rich feast, but to 54 _  and share with one another. We 55 _  my Grandmother's courage, but we all learned a lesson in grace. In the years following, my Grandma 56 _  to create meals for family events. She told me once with a laugh, \"I may not be able to eat, but I can 57 _  taste things.\" With a 58 _  heart, Grandma prepared what she could not have for the only purpose of making us 59 _  . She inspired me to learn to cook and helped me find the 60 _  to make everything come together: love.",
