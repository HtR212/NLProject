However  , the station is not here . After   _  long and hard about it, we've  _  that the right decision is to move to Chicago.\"\nMarc looked   _  , while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving . \"It's surprising but exciting!\" she said. Marc simply said, \"I can't leave my   _  . I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!\"\nThe Bonds hoped that by the time they moved to Chicago in August, Marc would grow more   used to  the idea of leaving. However, he showed no   _   of accepting the decision, refusing to   _  his belongings.\nOn the morning of their move, Marc was   _   to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyons' house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Bond became increasingly  _  while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so   _  .\nWhat they didn't know was that Marc had started to walk over to Tommy's house with a faint idea of 53 _ in Lyons' attic   for a few days . But as he walked along , all the   _  landscape of his neighborhood  _  him of the things he and his family had done together: the green fence he and his mother had painted; the trees he and his sister used to  _  while playing hide-and-seek; the park  _  he and his father often took walks together. How much would these   _   without his family, who made them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the  _  to answer that question but instead, he hurried back to his house,   _  if there were any boxes the right size to hold his record collection.",
