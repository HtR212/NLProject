    "article": "Peer pressure can be a powerful force, and sometimes a positive one. For example, hanging out with active peers may lead kids to  _  more, making a child's social network a vehicle for promoting healthy habits and  _  obesity unconsciously. The scientists studied networks of a group of students aged 5 to 12 and  _  how the youngsters' made and dropped friends, and  _  effect these changing relationships had on their physical activity level. In fact, children  _  their exercise level little by little to better  _  those in their circle; children who  hung out  with more active students were more  _  to increase their physical activity levels,  _  those who befriended more sedentary children became  _  active. The children were mirroring, following or adjusting to be  _  to their friends before they knew it. The encouraging  _  suggest a potentially effective way to change children's behavior.  Rather than  relying only on organized exercise programs to get moving, perhaps introducing sedentary kids to more active ones -- might help more kids  get off  the couch. It's believed that this is a possible novel approach to obesity  _  . The social environment does carry more power than we have given it  _  for, so we should make use of that intentionally to influence kids.  _  that children are increasingly connected to one another,  _  through face-to-face interactions or virtual ones, their  _  networks can clearly have a deep effect  _  many aspects of their behavior-help kids in the long run by turning them into healthier adults.",
