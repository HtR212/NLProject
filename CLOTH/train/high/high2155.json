    "article": "A friend of mine once told me a thing about his neighbor's bunny : One day he was sitting in the living room when his  _  dragged a little \"gift\" in its mouth--a  _  animal of some sort. Taking a closer look, he was nervous to  _  the dead animal to be a bunny that belonged to a little girl who lived next door. Her name was Bonny. My friend felt  _  , believing his cat had killed Bonny's bunny.\nMy  _  friend came up with a plan. Removing from the cat's mouth the dead animal, which by now was a dirty mess, he put it in the kitchen sink  . With a little warm water, he tried to  _  up the dead bunny as best as he could. Then he took a hair dryer and blow-dried the bunny  _  it looked pretty good.\nFinally, he took the dead bunny out to the neighbor's bunny box and placed it back in the cage. He fluffed  him up so that he looked very  _  there in his little box.\nThe next morning, my friend looked out of the window and noticed a crowd of people  _  around the bunny box. Everyone seemed to be  _  and pointing. My friend decided to go over and act like any normal curious  _  and find out what was going on.\nWhen he got there, Bonny's mother said to my friend, \"You won't  _  what has happened! It's a miracle! Bonny's bunny passed away a few days ago, and we buried that little bunny right over there.\"\nHave you ever tried to cover up one  _  with another? Covering up only makes matters  _  . Just like Bonny's bunny, the result is  _  what we expected. We end up looking foolish. We will be better off admitting we were wrong and accepting the consequences.",
