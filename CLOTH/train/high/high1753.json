I am one of those unfortunate people who have  _  sense of direction and I may have visited a place time after time but I still get  _  on my way there. When I was young I was so  _  that I never dared ask strangers the way and so I used to  _  round in circles and hope that I would happen to get to the place I was heading for. I am  no longer  too shy to ask people for directions, but I often  _  replies that puzzle me. Often people do not like to admit that they didn't know their hometown and will  _  on telling you the way, even if they do not know it ; others who are  _  to prove that they know their hometown very well, will give you a long  _  of directions which you cannot possibly hope to remember, and still others do not seem to be able to  _  between their left and their right and you find in the end that you are going in the  _  direction. If anyone ever asks me the way to somewhere, I always tell them I am a  _  to the town in order to avoid giving them wrong  _  but even this can have embarrassing results. Once I was on my way to work when I was stopped by a man who asked me if I would  _  him the way to the Sunlight Building. I gave my  _  reply, but I had not walked on a few steps when I  _  that he had asked for directions to my office building. However, at this point, I decided it was too late to turn back and  _  him in the crowd behind me  _  I was going to meet with someone at the office and I did not want to keep him waiting. Imagine my embarrassment when my secretary showed in the  _  man who had asked for directions to my office and his  _  when he recognized me as the person he had asked.",
