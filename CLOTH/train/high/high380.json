    "article": "Shortly after I started out as a professional baseball player in the Tri-State League, I was fired. \"Frank,\" the manager said   _  , \"whatever you do after you leave here, put some   _   and enthusiasm into your work!\" Well, that was the   _   thing I expected him to say.\nA week later,   _  , I was introduced to the New Haven. My first day here will always 40 stand out  in my memory as a great event in my life. No one knew me in the league, so I was   _   to make myself the most enthusiastic ball player they'd ever seen. From the minute I   _   on the field, I acted like a man electrified. And I acted as if I were alive with a million   _  . \nMy biggest thrill came the following morning 44 _  I read in the New Haven newspaper: \"This   _   player, Frank, has a barrel   of enthusiasm. He   _   our boys. They looked better than at any time this season.\" The newspapers began   _   me the life of the team.\nWithin two weeks, enthusiasm took me from $250 a month to $1850 a month--it   _   my income by 700 percent! Two years after that, I was   _   third base for the St. Louis and multiplied my income by thirty times. Enthusiasm   _   did it; nothing but enthusiasm.\nEnthusiasm is by far the highest paid   _   on earth. It helps you become more successful, and 52 _  a healthier, richer and happier life. \"To become enthusiastic--act enthusiastically.\" Put this rule into   _   for thirty days and be prepared to see astonishing   _  . It may easily change your entire life. Can you acquire enthusiasm--or must you be born    _   it? Certainly you can acquire it!",
