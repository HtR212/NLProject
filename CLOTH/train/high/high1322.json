Of course, we may 32 _  with our guide-books the history and  33 _  developments of a town and get to know them. \n      34 _  , if we take our time and 35 _  in a town for a while, we may get to know it better. When we 36 look at it as a whole, we begin to have some 37 _ , which even the best guide-books do not answer. Why is the town just 38 _  this ---- this shape, this plan, this size? Why do its streets39 _ in this particular way, and not in any 40 _  way?\n      Here even the best guide-book 41 _  us. One can't find the information in it about how a town has developed to the 42 _  appearance. It may not describe the original 43 _  of a town. However, one may get some idea of what it 44 used to  look like by walking around the town. One can also imagine 45 _  the town was first planned and built. Then one can learn more about in what direction the town 46 _ to develop.\n      What is the 47 _  of studying towns in this way?For me, it is48 _ a matter that one gets a greater depth of pleasure by visiting and seeing a town with one's own eyes. A49 _ visit to a town may help one better understand why it is attractive  _  just reading about it in a guide-book.",
