    "article": "The other night as I was leaving my son's room. I noticed a hockey puck sitting on his desk. It  _  me not only of an exciting hockey game he and I had  _  several years ago. but of a life lesson he had learned  as well  . During spring vacation from school,a friend gave us two  _  to a New York Rangers hockey game at Madison Square Garden. My son was very  _  because he is an avid Rangers fan,so we attended it. The roar of the crowd was right from the moment the puck was  _  dropped. When the Rangers  _  first, the crowd cheered. My son got caught up in the moment and  _  joined in the crowd. When the Rangers scored a second time, it seemed as if the building would  _  from the noise. Three young men  _  in the row in front of us, probably in their early 20s, caught my  _  as my son sang along with the crowd. They smiled at us. We were all one happy and excited hockey  _  . For my son, the victory was exciting. But that is not what he remembers about that night,  at least  that's not his primary recollection. After the winning goal had been scored,the losing team's goalkeeper  _  the hockey puck out of the net behind him, and  _  it into the crowd. One of the three young men before us caught the puck and,  as if  in one motion after catching it, threw it back to my son. My son looked at the puck as if he had been given a golden  _  . \"Why did that man give me the puck?\" I explained to my son that the man had given him the puck because he knew how  _  it would make him to have a souvenir from the game, and not just any souvenir, but the puck that had been the  _  goal in a shootout. It was obvious that he knew it would  _  more to my son than it would to him.",
