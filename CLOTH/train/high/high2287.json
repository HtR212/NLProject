    "article": "This story is about a 92-year-old, polite and proud lady. She is fully   _  each morning by eight, with her hair fashionably done and make-up  _  applied, even though she is old and weak. She is moving to a nursing\nhome today. Her husband of 70 years old recently  passed away  , making the move necessary.\nAfter many hours of waiting   _  in the hall of the nursing house, she smiled sweetly when  _  her room was ready. As she directed her walker to the elevator, I\nprovided a visual  _  of her tiny\nroom, including the eyelet  sheets that had been hung on her window. \"I   _  it,\" she stated with the enthusiasm of an eight-year-old girl who had\njust been  _  with a new puppy.\n\"Mrs. Jones, you haven't seen the   _  yet. Just wait.\"\n\"That has nothing to do with it,\" she replied. \"  _  is something you decide\non ahead of time. Whether I like my room or not does not  depend on  how the furniture is arranged; it is how I make up my  _  . I've already decided to love it. It's a decision I make every morning\nwhen I  wake up  .\n\"I have a   _  : I can spend the day in bed recounting the difficulties I have with the\nparts of my body that no longer work, or get out of bed and be  _  for the ones that do. Each day is a  _  , and as long as my eyes open I will focus on the new day and all the happy  _  I've stored away....just for this\ntime in my life.\n\"Age is like a bank account. You withdraw   _  what you have put\nin. Therefore, my advice to you would be to  _  a lot of happiness in the bank account of memories. Thank you for\nyour part in  _  my memory bank, I am\nstill depositing.",
