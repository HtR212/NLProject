    "article": "My holiday was about two months long and the first thing I wanted to do is to get my driving license, so I called the driving school to make sure of my  _  time, after that, I booked a room to make sure my friend and I have a place to stay when we  _  there.\nSo everything went on well  _  the test-day finally arrive! I'm both excited and  _  . I took the school bus and when I got there I went to the  _  first. Something happened when I came out of the restroom. I  _  over and broke my right foot.\nOMG! I didn't know what to do so I called my mom and she  _  me up and we went to the hospital at once.  _  the doctor said, \"It is fine. You didn't hurt the  _  , but it will take almost two months to recover.\" That was disappointing, and I was totally  _  .\nThrough those painful days I had nothing to do but  _  the Internet and read books about some disabled persons who are not  _  by their physical problems. These books would help me  _   sooner. It was so amazing! After reading the books my  _  seemed to become better, and better, day after day! And I began to feel better  _  myself and about my foot. I started to use the  _   \"thank you\" more often than before, and most importantly, I started to think  _  .\nThings do change when your  _  changes. I soon recovered and could walk again. After coming back from my trip, I went to   _  my driving test, and it went very well. I  _  it without any difficulties. I'm a driver now!",
