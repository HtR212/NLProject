    "article": "My 9-year-old daughter and I were flying from our home in Carolina to spend a week with my husband in Florida.We were  _  about the trip because we hadn't seen him for five months, and  _  her Dad terribly. As usual on the Charlotte-to-Miami flight, the plane was totally  _  . Because we did not get our boarding passes until we  _  at the gate, Kallie and I could not get seats together and were  _  by the aisle . I asked two passengers in my row if they would switch places with Kallie and me,  so that  we could be together. They  _  , saying they thought they should stay in their assigned seats. Meanwhile, a mother and her three children were in a  _  several rows ahead of us. There had been a mistake in their boarding passes, and  _  the whole family had been split up. The passengers in her row  _  refused to move elsewhere. She was very  _  about the younger boy sitting with strangers. She was in tears, yet nobody  _  to help her. There were a troop of Boy Scouts on  _  . Suddenly the Scout leader stood up and said, \"Ma'am, I think we can help you.\" He then  _  five minutes rearranging his group so that adequate space was  _  for the family. The boys followed his directions cheerfully and without  _  , and the mother's relief was obvious. Kallie, however, was beginning to panic at the  _  of not being next to me. I told her that there wasn't anything I could do.  _  , the man sitting next to the Scoutmaster,  turned around  to me and asked, \"Would you and your daughter like our seats?\"  _  to himself and the Scoutmaster. We traded seats and continued our trip, very much relieved to be together and watch the scenery from Kallie's window seat.",
