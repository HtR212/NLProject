Do you always have good   _  everyday?\" He said with a smile, \"Look, how beautiful and   _  these flowers are, making me live in the   _  . Can't I be happy?\"\nOn a Valentine's Day, I bought a bouquet of roses from an old woman for my   _  . But because of our irreparable  disagreement, she   _  down the flowers in the presence of me.   _  , the old woman caught up with us, gave back the money to me and immediately picked up the   _  flowers from the ground.\nShe gently stroked  the rose petals,   _  off every grain of dust from them and said   _  , \"I have made a vow to each bouquet of flowers, with my sincere blessing! Why did you throw it away? You're not qualified to be  _  of the bouquet of flowers.\"\nOn another   _  occasion, it was a sunny day, with the surging crowds and a lot of  _  . In middle of the street lay a handful of red roses. A boy was anxious to pick them up,   _  he was unable to go forward for the busy traffic. When it was his turn, he raced   _  , but the roses had been rolled to pieces. The boy picked them up, bit by bit, the remains of the flowers, slowly   _  those injured petals, held them in his hands for a long time and broke into tears in the street.\nUntil now, I'm  _  often moved for that scene.\nOne day, British writer Oscar Wilde walked into a flower shop and   _  to have some of the flowers taken out of the shop window. The shop clerk did as he told and asked how many he   _  buy. Wilde said, \"I don't want to buy the flowers, but I think they're too  _  , afraid they would be crushed, so I want them to take it easy.\"\nKnowing their sorrows and joys and caring for their pains, they are the friends of flowers. They will neither miss a butterfly flying in the sleeve nor  _  each beautiful scene of life. To be the friend of a flower is to live in the spring of the soul.",
