    "article": "It was Thanksgiving morning and in the crowded kitchen of my small home I was busy preparing the traditional Thanksgiving turkey when the doorbell rang. I   _  the\nfront door and saw two small children in  _  huddling together on the top step.\n\"Any old   _  , lady ?\"asked one of them. I was busy. I wanted to say \"no\" until I looked\ndown at their feet. They were  _  thin little sandals , wet with heavy snow.\n\"Come in and I'll make you a cup of hot   _  \".\nThey walked over and sat down at the table. Their   _  sandals left marks\nupon the floor I served them coffee and bread with jam to fight against the\ncold  _  . Then I went back to the  kitchen  and started again on\nmy household budget.\nThe silence in the front room   _  me, so I looked in. The girl held the  _  cup in her hands, looking at it. The boy asked in a flat  _  ,\"Lady,\nare you rich?\" \"Am I rich? Mercy, no!\"I looked at my shabby slipcovers . The girl   _  her\ncup back in saucer carefully and said, \"Your   _  match you saucers.\n\"Her voice was hungry with a need that large amount of food could supply. They\nleft after that,  _  their bundles of papers against the\nwind. They hadn't said \"Thank you\". They didn't  _  to. They\nhad reminded me that I had so much for which to be  _  . Plain blue\nchina cups and saucers were  _  worth five pence. But they\nmatched.\n I moved the chairs back from the fire and cleaned the living room. The muddy   _  of small sandals were  _  wet upon my floor. \"Let\nthem be for a while, \"I thought. Just  in case  I should begin to\nforget how rich I am.",
