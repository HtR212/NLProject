And I saw the crisscross   of twisting, turning streets   _   to the square.\n\"See, my dear,\" Father said gently. \"There is more than one way to the   _  . Life is like that. If you can't get to the place where you want to go by one road, try   _  .\"\nIn the years that followed I often remembered the   _   Father taught me. I knew where I wanted to   _   in life. I wanted to be fashion designer. But on the way to my first small success I found the road   _  .\nThat year I was busy getting ready to show my winter fashions. Then just 13 days before the     _   the sewing girls were called out on strike. I found myself   _   with one tailor and woman who was in charge of the sewing room! I was as gloomy as my models and salesgirls. \"We'll never   _   it,\" one of them cried.\nHere, I thought, is the   _   of all tests for Father's advice. Where is the way   _   this time? I wondered and worried. I was certain we would have to   call off   the presentation or else show the clothes unfinished. Then it   _   to me. Why not show the unfinished clothes?\nWe worked hurriedly. And, exactly 13 days later, right   _   time, the Schiaparelli showing   took place  .\nWhat a showing it was! Some coats had no sleeves; others had only one. Many of our clothes were still in a(n)   _   stage. They were only patterns made of heavy cotton cloth. But on these we   _   simple pictures and pieces of material.\nAll in all, the showing was different. It was so different that it was a great success. Our   _   showing caught the attention of the public, and   _   for the clothes poured in.\nFather's wise words has guided me. There is more than one way to the square always.",
