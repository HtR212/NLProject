Thought to be the strongest  _  fiber on the planet,spider silk could be used to rebuild injured ligaments.Randolph Lewis at the University of Wyoming in Laramine has been  working on  the idea. Spider silk has interested scientists for centuries.A(n)  _  European folk story at least 2,000 years old tells of the possible medical  _  of spider webs.It said they could help in fighting infections,stopping bleeding and healing wounds. Researches have found no  _  so far that spider webs can kill germs.But studies on animals have shown that spider silk helps  _  the rejection of medical implants.So Lewis' lab and others are changing spider silk into fibers that they hope might be  _  in medicine. Researchers have found that spider webs could be used to rebuild ligaments  _  in one of the world's common knee injuries.\"We're also  looking at  spider silk in artificial tendons .\" Lewis said. Scientists are also  _  spider silk to be used for stitching up wounds which will help them heal without scarring .",
