Only five   _   were left: the manager and four others, all over 60 years old.\nIn the town near the restaurant there lived a successful businessman who was good at managing business, so the manager   _   to ask the businessman if he could offer any advice that might   _  the restaurant. The manager and the businessman talked for a long period of time,   _   when he was asked for advice, the businessman   _   for a while and then said, \"I have no advice to give. The   _  thing I can tell you is that the saver  is one of you.\"\nThe manager, returning to the restaurant   _  , told the other people what the businessman had said. In the months that followed, the old restaurant workers thought carefully of the words of the businessman, \"The saver is one of us?\" they asked themselves. As they   _  about this possibility, they all began to treat each other with   _  respect. And thinking that each of themselves   might   be the saver, they also began to treat themselves with more care.\nAs time went by, people coming to the restaurant   _  that some respect and warm kindness were around the five old members of the small restaurant. Hardly knowing   _  , more people began to come back to the restaurant. They began to   _   their friends, and theirs brought more friends. Two years later, the small restaurant had once again   _   a big food company, thanks to the businessman's   _  . They understood that it was they themselves that were the savers.",
