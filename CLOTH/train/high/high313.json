    "article": "Years ago, I drove into a service station to get some gas. It was a beautiful day, and I was feeling great. As I walked into the station to   pay for   the gas, the owner said to me, \"How do you feel?\" That seemed like a   _   question, but I felt fine and told him   _   .\n\"You don't look well,\" he replied. This   _   me completely by surprise. A little less   _   , I told him that I had never felt better. Without   _   , he continued to tell me how bad I looked and that my skin appeared   _   .\nBy the time I left the service station, I was feeling a little 38 _  . About a block away, I   pulled over  to the side of the road to look at my face in the mirror. How did I feel? Was I sick? Was everything all right? By the time I got home, I was beginning to feel a little ill. Did I have hepatitis  ? Had I   picked up  some rare disease?\nThe next time I went into that gas station, feeling fine again, I   figured out   what had happened. The place had recently been painted a bright yellow, and the light   _   off the walls made everyone inside look as though they had hepatitis! I wondered how many other folks had   _   the way I did. I had let one short conversation with a total stranger change my   _   for an entire day. He told me I looked sick, and before long, I was   _   feeling sick. That single   _   observation had a strong effect on the way I felt and   _    .\nA little while later I saw how   _   the incident was, although on that day when the man had told me how ill I looked, I was   _   frightened. I wonder how many other people that man had told they were ill   _   he realized that the service station had had a paint job!",
