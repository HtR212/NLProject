    "article": "When my husband and I were having dinner at our favorite restaurant, Lenny, the piano player, asked, \"This is your 38th wedding   _  , how did you do it?\" I knew there was no simple answer,but at the   _  of the approaching weekend, I wondered if one reason might be our ritual  of breakfast in bed every Saturday and Sunday.\n   28 _ , it all started with the breakfast tray my mother gave us as a wedding gift. It had a glass top and wooden side pockets for the morning paper, exactly the same kind you would   _  in a romantic movie. Mother loved those movies.   _  she rarely had breakfast in bed, she held high hopes for her daughter. My beloved   _  took the message to heart and did quite a lot to make delicious breakfast for us. Feeling guilty, I suggested we   take turns  . Soon these weekend breakfasts became so natural a part of our lives that I   _   even thought about them. I only knew we   _  this separate, peaceful time for we can read, relax and enjoy life to our hearts' content.\n  So many years passing by, I recalled how our weekend   _  , but eating breakfast in bed as a   _   was preserved.   Apart from  different kinds of delicious breakfast, I became increasingly interested in   _  the tray with anything available to me. First it was fruit slices   _  in a geometric pattern; then were   _  from our garden, sometimes just one blossom from a grapefruit. Perhaps it was on a Saturday when the big strawberry wore a rose hat that I began to think, how can I   come up  with a more imaginative one? One dark winter night I woke with a vision of a   snowman  on a tray. That Sunday I scooped   a handful of snow and in no time had my man made. \n  As I delivered the tray, complete with a nicely   _   snowman, I waited for a reaction. There was   _  . But as I headed down the stairs I heard a burst of laughter and then, \"Honey, you are   _  . Congratulations, you've won the prize!\"",
