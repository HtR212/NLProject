    "article": "There are going to be moments in life when you must make very important decisions. You will find many people  _  to offer you advice if you ask for it (and even if you don't), but always remember that the life you  _  is yours and nobody else's. It's important to decide for yourself what's important to you and what you want before you  turn to  others. Because while there will be times  _  outside advice proves wise, there will be at least as many times when it proves completely  _  . The only way to really evaluate other folks' advice is to first learn everything that you can about whatever challenge you are  _  . Once you've done that, in most cases you should be able to make a wise decision  on your own  anyway. You were  _  with the ability to decide what is and what isn't in your best interest. Most of the time, you will make the right decision and  _  the appropriate action, and in thinking for yourself, you will become far more successful than if you had gone against your own  _  . Early on in my investment career, I made the mistake of  _  a few important business decisions on colleagues' opinions instead of conducting the  _  necessary to make a wise decision. It wasn't due to  _  on my part; no one could ever accuse me of that. But, being  _  to Wall Street, I intended to suppose that my more senior  _  knew more than I did, and so I  _  too much significance to their opinions. You know what happened? Each of those investments ended in  _  . Eventually I stopped allowing myself to be influenced by  _  and began doing the work myself and making my own decisions. It took me until I was almost 30 years old to  _  this--it's never too late for a person to change his approach both to  _  and to life.",
