Instead, he's using time he has left to  _  a message. \"Live life to the  _  because you never know what's going to  _  ,\" Shaun says in a video he sent online. Born with a  _  disease Shaun spent his childhood in and out of  _  . He's had almost 1000 operations in total, and his first heart transplant  _  just eight-year-old. He had another transplant  _  at thirteen, but his body didn't  _  it. \"It could be six months, could be twelve months--don't know. It's  _  for me as a father that Shaun will close his eyes and not  _  up again. One day that will be it,\" his dad Cameron said. \"I have the heart rejection where the arteries became narrow, and it's difficult for the blood to  get through  ,\" Shaun explained. So why did he make the video which has  _  so many? \"I made it to let my Face Book friends know what was going on,\" Shaun said. \"It was hard to make the video, but it's harder to watch the video. It  _  that you have heart rejection and you will die soon.\" Shaun's You Tube video has gone  _  , with more than 50000 hits already. People who were inspired by his message, called into offering  _  . His airfares to Disneyland were  _  for by a kind person. Another offered to buy his Disneyland tickets. \"There'll be a lot more  _  to come,\" said Cameron, who is looking for a  _  to turn his son's story into a book. Life may be  _  but Shaun will live it to the fullest,  _  each day as a gift.",
