    "article": "On a Saturday morning, my left arm went numb, and I felt dizzy. I was taken to hospital. After a quick  _  , the doctor said I had a stroke. As waves of paralysis  came over me, I slowly lost  _  of my body. I was just 50 and I thought about how   _  it was.\nAfter two operations, I was transferred to the Recovery Center. Though I had lost the use of my  _  arm and leg and couldn't see out of my left eye, the only thought on my mind was to return to my job. But the  _  was that I needed to relearn how to  _  and see first. I had always been kind of  _  , and this just made me feel like recovery was impossible.\nA few days after my first  _  physical therapy  session, my mother came into my room with a neatly-typed  _  written by a nine-year-old boy named Jackson. He told me about the stoke he'd had only a year earlier. He, too, had been paralyzed on his left side. But,  _  telling me what he had lost, Jackson shared what I would  _  . \"Do not give up on yourself. All the hard work is worth it.\" he wrote.\nAnd the advice kept on coming. He told me to  _  the therapy on the hospital's \"grown-up\" floor, where \"they make you work hard and you get lots of things back fast.\" Here I was, a grown man and a senator of Illinois, getting  _  from a young boy I had   _  met.\nAfter a few weeks of correspondence , I arranged for us to meet. He seemed   _  at first, but all the awkwardness quickly  melted away  . Jackson showed me how he could run, and I immediately felt  _  . One thing I particularly  _  was the energy and dignity radiating from him.\nAs for my recovery, it   _  just as Jackson said it would. After a year of intense physical therapy, I climbed to the top of the Capitol and returned to work. With every step I took, I thought of Jackson and his   _  . Whenever I was tired or discouraged, I thought of him, the world's strongest boy.",
