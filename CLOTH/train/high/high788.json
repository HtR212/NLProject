    "article": "Today we spent the morning going through our personal belongings .We were looking for items to  give away  for free at a local park. Not just any items but things people really  _  . Our aim was not to find things we no longer  _  but things we use every day that would be  _  to others. We packed these things  _  boxes and added some small toys. We added a list of local addresses and phone numbers of local  _  agencies. Inside the boxes a simple letter was placed. It  _  : \"Please take these items and know that your life is important.  _  are difficult but these days will pass. We share what we have believing that it will matter. Use the food to nurture your  _  ; use the blankets to stay warm. Be safe and know that the human  _  can overcome anything. Do not hold your head  _  for having a need to stay warm. Someday please do the same when you can.\" This kind  _  was not because the phone rang or for any reason. It was  _  because it was the right to do. We have often seen  _  people at the park where we left the belongings. I  _  that my wife had put her favorite green coat into one of the boxes. I asked if she was  _  about it and she just replied that it had a hood . Her answer told me why it is I who love her. She liked the coat but knew the hood could  _  someone from the rain. Who knows where these gifts of sympathy will  _  ? How many uses can a blanket serve  other than  what it was designed to do? We never go back and see what happens. It is unimportant. The right things will find the right people and that is all that  _  .",
