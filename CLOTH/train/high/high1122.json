My legs felt weak. I had looked down the long hallway and could only imagine the   _   before me. This was a world I   _   expected to enter. I felt   _   but fear from what lay ahead.\nWhat lay ahead was not as bad as I thought.   In fact  , the experience brought the unexpected reward of self-discovery. But I didn't know it then. All I knew was that I had been operated   _   for cancer and now was to   _   five weeks of radiation. My mood showed in my   _  . No make-up. No interest in the clothes I had put on that morning. No smile on my face.\nAn attractive woman walked into the building   _   I was waiting for my treatment. Stockings, suit, hat, make-up; perfect.\n\"I'm here for my check-up,\" she said, smiling.\nI turned to my husband. \"You'd never know,\" I whispered. She had cancer and she looked   _  . She had suffered radiation and she was walking, talking, smiling, and   _   with the nurse. She was a survivor. I was   _   to see her face and to hear her cheerful voice. It made my legs   _   when it was my turn to go inside for my treatment. I determined right then and there to someday have her   _  . \"I'm going to do for someone else what she has done for me,\" I   _   to myself.\nNow it was one year later.

My new \"after cancer\" attitude was obvious.\n\"You look great,\" she said.\nA man was sitting to my right. His face was pale and   _  . His legs were shaking. I knew it was his first time. He   looked at   me for a long time and I knew what he was thinking. I sent a smile his way. His face brightened and he   _   it.\nI had done my part.",
