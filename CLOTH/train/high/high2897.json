She said that when her  _  students graduated, she liked them to come back and  _  their fifth-grade dreams together, as a memory of their childhood. I decided right then that I liked Mrs. Barrow. A month later, my grandmother died of cancer.  _  her was so painful for me that I  _  some school. At the funeral , I was sitting feeling sorry for myself when I looked  _  and saw Mrs. Barrow standing there. She  _  my hand and comforted me by reminding me that Grandma had no more pain or  _  .  _  had never occurred to me that it was better for my grandma this way.
