    "article": "There is an old Spanish Proverb which states, \"Tomorrow is often the busiest day of the week\". How many times have we   put off   dreams until tomorrow? I'd say too many. Our dreams should not, and cannot   _  . We have to go for them now! Here is why. \nAs you know, tomorrow is not promised. Nobody likes to talk about death, but the   _   is: everybody is going to die at one point.   _   of us know the day, or the hour.   _  , today is all we have. Don't go to your grave with   _   dreams. Make the   _   to go after every dream, big or small right now.\nUnless you take the first step, your dreams will never   come true  . You can   _   about writing the great American play, but it's never going to happen unless you actually put pen to   _  . You can dream about finding a cure   _   cancer, but it will never happen unless you actually go to school to become   _   with the necessary tools to find that cure. In other words, dreams don't work unless you do. They   _   you to get your head out of the clouds, and actually do the work to make them happen.  \nYou can't let fear win. One of the biggest dream   _   is fear. There are so many people who could   have achieved   amazing things if only they weren't afraid. Just think about all the things you've wanted to do, but allowed fear to   _   you of the fact that you weren't capable, or good enough. In the movie After Earth, Will Smith's character says, \"Fear is not   _  . It is a product of thoughts you create. Do not misunderstand me. Danger is what exists. But fear is a choice.\" Choose not to let fear   _   you from achieving your dreams.\nImagine how much   happier   you'll be if you're living the life you always dreamed about. The only thing that is stopping you is you. There are so many amazing   _   and people waiting for you. So don't keep your dreams waiting. Go after them today!",
