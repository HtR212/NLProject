    "article": "I've often puzzled over something that happened to me one winter when I was eight. Over the years I had been wondering if my  _  was nothing more than a kid's imagination. There was a  _  near our house. In winter it was the greatest  _  place in the world. One  _  all I wanted to do was go skating. I had been waiting for weeks  _  the water was frozen solid. Mom had one rule: \"Never ice-skate alone.\" But I couldn't  _  any longer that afternoon. So I  _  my skates under my coat and ran to the pond. Several people were skating near the shore, and some kids were playing hockey.I was not really  _  . The hockey game had attracted  _  audience, so I skated in the other direction until their cheering  _  But another noise came soon. The ice was cracking beneath me. Freezing water  _  my body, and I sank like a rock. My feet  _  e bottom. Just when I thought I wouldn't last another  _  , I felt a tap on my shoulder. \"Don't worry,\" someone said. I swung my  _  around. I couldn't see anybody. But I heard the voice again,\"Push your feet into the bottom and you'll shoot straight up to the surface.\" I did as I was told and  _  . I crawled to the shore and lay down,  _  .The next thing I knew was people were  _  around me, covering me with coats. When I awoke, I was home in my own bed. Mom sat next to me,  _  my hand. \"I saw nobody there. It must be an angel that came to my  _  .\" I said. Mom smiled, \"I just thank God you're safe.\" For a long time I thought I would  come up with  a more realistic explanation if I just thought hard, but I never did.",
