On a Friday night I  _  at the dinner table, \"My teacher said we have to bring a box, a special box, for our valentines on Monday\". Mother said, \"We'll see,\" and she continued eating. What did \"We'll see\" mean? I had to have that box,  _  my second grade Valentine's Day would be a disaster. Maybe they didn't love me enough to help me with my  _  . All Saturday I waited  _  and with Sunday arriving, my concern increased. However, I  _  that an enquiry about the box would  _  anger or loud voices, for in my house children only asked once. More than that  _  trouble. Late Sunday afternoon, my father called me into the kitchen. The table was covered with different kinds of colorful  _  . A (n)  _  shoebox rested on top of it.  _  flooded through me when Daddy said, \"Let's get started  _  your project.\" In the next hour my father  _  the shoebox into an impressive valentine box. Colorful paper covered the ugly cardboard with red hearts  _  to what I considered all the right places. He sang while he worked. When he finished, he was so delighted that a  _  smile spread across his face. \"What do you think of that?\" he asked. I answered him with a hug. But inside,  _  danced all the way to my heart. It was the first time that my father had devoted so much  _  to me, for his world consisted only of work. The holiday party arrived, and my classmates put cards and presents into the valentine boxes. Laughter filled our classroom until dismissal time  _  . On the way home, I held out my valentine box for the world to  _  . The love that filled it meant more to me than all the valentines inside. The valentine box became a symbol of his love that  _  through decades of other Valentine's Days. My father gave me other gifts through the years, but none  _  compared with the love I felt within the limits of the old, empty shoebox.",
