    "article": "One day I pulled up to my apartment building and noticed there was a father and daughter   _   some things from a moving truck. Normally I'm shy away from contact with   _  . That particular day, though, something was in me; I can't explain   _  , but I felt like I should just help these people, even   _   something as seemingly unimportant as unloading a truck. So I   came up   and introduced myself, welcomed them to the town, and asked them to give me a(n)   _   to put some proper shoes on. After I had flip-flops on, I went over and helped them move all of their   _   into the apartment.\nAfter we finished, we talked some and I got to know my new   _  . It might seem unimportant, but it seems that people are less   _   and friendly to their neighbors these days; I wanted to   _   that, at least in my small   _   block. So we did talk, and they're from Florida, just like me.\nAt that   _   time in my life, I was going through a really difficult   _   with my girlfriend of 7 years. I didn't feel like helping anyone or doing anything   _  , but I figured why not?And I'm glad I did. Also, as   _   would have it, their daughter is my age(college student) and we each had a mutual    _  in one another. This developed into a friendship, and in the coming months, probably more.\nThe   _   was the act itself, though. I got to know my new neighbors and made some new friends in the   _  . And I felt really good about it. Since then, I've tried   _   my comfort zone to perform other unplanned acts of   _  . So far, so good. I'd encourage everyone else to do the same!",
