Why do you shout at a person when you're angry?\" Disciples gave some other answers but none  _  the saint. Finally he explained, \"When two people are angry at each other, their  _  distance a lot. To cover that distance they must shout to be able to hear each other. The angrier they are, the  _  they will have to shout to hear each other through that great distance.\" Then the saint asked, \"What  _  when two people fall in love? They don't shout at each other but talk softly, why? Because their hearts are very close and the distance between them is very  _  .\" The saint continued, \"When they love each other even more, what happens? They do not speak loudly, only whisper and they get  _  closer to each other in their love. Finally they even need not whisper, they only  look at  each other and that's all. That is how close two people are when they love each other.\" The saint said finally, \"When you argue, do not let your hearts get  _  , and do not say words that distance each other more, or there will come a day when the distance is so great that you will not  _  the path to return!\"",
