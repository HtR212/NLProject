He fired people who didn't do well without giving them a second   _  .\n\"Watson,\" said Mr. Smith, \"this past year your department hasn't earned money. We're going to  _  that department. It's finished. I' m sorry,   _  you'll have to go.\" \"But, sir--if I just had a little more time.  For the moment  ,I need the job to keep my son at Riverside School.\"\n\"What's that!\" said the Boss. \"Riverside! I didn't know you had a boy there. That's an   _  school for a man with your salary.\"\n\"I know, sir. But he likes it there so much! He's a star trackman   and the best 47 _  in the school. The boys call him Champ   there.\"\nThe Boss sat perfectly still for a long time- a   _   look in his eyes. Then, suddenly, he said, \"We have got to close your  _  , Watson. But you will50 take over a new job in another department. It means longer hours-maybe more pay. Now get out. You're here   _  life.\"\nWatson got out, with 52 _  in his face. Then the Boss took a   _  from the top drawer of his desk. It was Herbie's last letter from Riverside School --written a few days before he died. He had read it over and over again with sick pain. The letter  _   : \nI can't say the boys here are any nicer to me than the others were. I guess it's the same   _   when you're a cripple  . But don't worry about me, Dad. They have got a good  _  department here. And there's one boy here who is really  _  . He's a track star and boxing champ and just tops in chemistry. The boys call him Champ. He made them stop throwing my books   _  . And he knocked a boy down who hit me. He is the best friend I   _   had. Dad, when I grow up, I want to do something for Champ. Something   _  --that he won't even know about.\n                                   Your son,\n                                   Herbie",
