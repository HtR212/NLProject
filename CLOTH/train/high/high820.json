I asked her, \"What do you want?\" She said, \"  _  Mum, you always tell us to\nhave a good day  _  we leave the house, but I was  _  about\nwho tells you to have a good day and lets you know how much you are  _  .\"\nI am so   _  by the capacity of love and\nunderstanding that  comes from  my children. My 15-year-old son asked me last\nnight if there was a(n)  _  for him to get a summer job this year in\norder to help us to pay our bills.  _  , in our area, he must be 16.\n  _   of my children depend on me so much because I am a   _  parent, but just when I pay the  _  that I will not be able to provide\nfor them, they come up with ways to  help out  . I completely understand that I\nwill  _  have to find a way to pay the bills as I do not want my children\nto take up anything. But for now the  _  that they have stepped up and  _  to help without anyone asking touches me.\nWhen my daughter was two, I remember rushing to get to   _  , getting to the front door and asking her to  hurry up  and\ncome. Then she appeared at the door with a bag that she was holding open. I\nsaid, \"We don't have  _  for this.\" She stopped me and said, \"Fill it\nwith love, Mum.\" I  _  to my knees and hugged her and then kissed her.\nFrom then  _  she would bring the bag and I would bring the love to the\ndoor before we left for school and work.",
