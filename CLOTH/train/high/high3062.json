    "article": "I stopped at a grocery store the other day because I was about to go on a long drive and I wanted to buy my favorite  _  for the trip. It wasn't the store I  _  go to, just one I passed along the way. As I walked up to the entrance, I  _  a man and a boy who was about 10 or 12 years old  _  at the front of the store. The man handed  _  half-sheets of white paper as customers walked past. I walked up to them with  _  , wondering what cause they  _  . As I got closer, I saw that they had two carts starting to fill with  _  . I said hello and the man greeted me and  _  me one of the pieces of paper,  _  that they were collecting donations for the homeless. On the paper was a simple  _  of food items: peanut butter, noodles, pasta sauce, canned fruits and vegetables. It also included a short story about the boy and his  _  to collect food donations since the age of 8. I was really  _  that someone so young would be so interested in helping others. I told him it was a(n)  _  idea and that he should be proud of himself. He smiled. Then, I went inside to get my drink.  _  , the store didn't have it.  _  , I wasn't upset, because by then I felt I had another mission. I went through the store,  _  things from the list, then brought them back out to the boy and put them in the cart. They thanked me and offered me a(n)  _  (candy, I think). As I walked back to my car, the boy's well-intentioned spirit  _  with me. How inspiring to  come across  a young boy with a resolve to do good deeds, and the courage to act on it.",
