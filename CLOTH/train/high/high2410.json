    "article": "I was having my dinner at McDonald's one evening when an old couple slowly walked in. They  _  their meal, took a table near the window and started  _  food out of the plate. There was one hamburger, one order of French fries and one drink. The man  _  the food into two halves and carefully placed  _  before his wife. He took a sop of the drink. His wife also took one and then  _  the cup down between them.\"That  _  old couple! All they can  _  is one meal for the two of them , \" thought I.  _  the man began to eat his French fries, I  _  to my feet, went over and said that I was  _  to buy another meal for them. But he  _  refused me and said that they made it a  _  to share everything.  _  the lady didn't take a bite. She sat there  _  her husband eat, and taking turns sipping the drink. Again I  _  to buy them something but was refused. When the man finished eating and was  _  his face with a napkin , I  _  no longer stand it. I made an offer to them a third time.  _  being politely refused, I asked the lady  _  ,\"Madam, why aren't you eating? You said that you share everything.  _  is it that you are waitting for?\"\"The teeth,\"she answered.",
