How to become disciplined?\nYou might think that many people are not self disciplined,   _   I'm going to prove to you that people in general are disciplined, but  _   , in non-beneficial ways. There are many people who smoke daily  _   the fact that it is harmful and   _  and it could kill them. Such people are disciplined at  _  cigarettes and smoking. There are people who are disciplined at drinking lots of alcohol daily. Such people are disciplined at consuming alcohol. Do you   _  where I am going with this?\nOne of my friends who has a  _  for running spends half an hour every single morning running. Whether it is snowing or raining, she has to run. This is the kind of  _   discipline that you are supposed to  _  and create in your life.\nDo you know someone who bought a book, but didn't finish  _   it for some reason? Do you know someone who decided to improve his  _  and start eating more vegetables and fruit, but after two weeks, he  gave up  ?\nThese are all examples of  _  of discipline. If you are not disciplined,then you will have a hard time to get your   _  . As I mentioned in my book \"The ultimate guide to achieving your goals\" that you could know what you want,   _  and take action, but if you are not self-disciplined, you will  _   give up.\nWith discipline, you can start getting up early in the morning, exercise, and  _  yourself of the non-beneficial habits such as smoking and eating non-healthy food. With discipline, you can change negative habits to positive habits. With discipline, you can join the gym and start working on having a   _  body. Do you see what the   _  of discipline can do?\nAlways remember what Jim Rohn said, \"One discipline always leads to another discipline.\"",
