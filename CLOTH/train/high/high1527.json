    "article": "I graduated from a small public school in Michigan. One day,Mr. Ledy,our football coach,asked me to play football. I couldn't help  _  :me,play football? I was six feet tall and was not much  _  a hundred pounds in weight. I thought that they might just need  _  fool to increase the number of the players. However,he was persistent and  _  I joined the football team. That  turned out  to be one of my best decisions as a kid. Our worst game  _  was the one against Crystal Falls. They beat us 56 to 6. Yeah! That was a football not a basketball  _  . We played them again when we were seniors. They  _  us again but the score was much more  _  ,30 to 20. Coach Ledy would not let that  _  again. He encouraged us to beat them,to pay them back. And we did so in the last game we played before  _  . I had scored 6 points alone in the game. Coach Ledy praised me. It was a huge  _  for me. Was I a football hero? Ha! Ha! No,I couldn't  _  it without our team. The thing I learned through football was  _  . We won as a team and we  _  as a team. I think Mr. Ledy would be  _  of me if he knew that I had broken the athletic  _  at the University of Michigan. I'm  _  to him as I would not have today's honor without him. I'll  _  life's final war with pain to win the victory;I'll seek the lights of glory wholeheartedly and I'll  keep on  working hard so as not to let him down.",
