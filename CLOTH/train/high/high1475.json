I walked toward him and asked who he wished to give this  _  to. \"My sister wanted the doll so much for Christmas. She was  _  that Santa Claus would bring it to her.\" \"Maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her. Don't be  _  .\" But he replied  _  , \"No, Santa Claus can't bring it to her now. I have to give the doll to my  _  so she can give it to my sister when she goes there. My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy says that Mommy is going there very soon too,  _  I think she can take it to my sister.\" My heart  _  stopped. The boy continued, \"I asked Mommy not to go until I  came back  from the shop.\" Then he showed me a nice photo of him, \"I want Mommy to take my picture with her, so she won't  _  me.\" I quickly  reached for  my wallet and said, \"Let's  _  again. Perhaps you do have enough for the doll?\" \"OK,\" he said. I  _  some money without him seeing and we started to  _  it. There was enough for the doll and even some  _  money. The boy said, \"Thank God! I asked God last night to make sure I had enough money for the doll. He  _  me! I also wanted to buy a white rose for Mum, because Mum loves white roses. But I didn't  _  to ask God for too much. He gave me enough to buy the doll and a white rose. How  _  it is!\" The  _  that the little boy had for his mother and his sister  _  me greatly.",
