If a(n)  _  was having a bad day, Jerry was always there, telling him/her how to look on the  _  side of the situation. This attitude really made me  _  , so one day I asked him, \"I don't get it! No one can be a positive person  all the time  . How can you manage it?\" \"Every time something bad happens, I can choose to  learn from  it. Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining and I can  point out  the positive side of life. Why don't we just do that later?\" Jerry said.

While trying to open the safe, his hand, shaking from  _  , slipped off the combination . The robbers got angry and  _  him.  _  , Jerry was found quickly and taken to the hospital. After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of care, Jerry  _  with fragments of the bullets still in his body. I saw Jerry about six months after the  _  . I did ask him what had gone through his mind as the accident took place. \"Did you lose consciousness?

'Yes' I replied. The doctors and nurses stopped  working  as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, '  _  !'\" \"Over the laughter, I told them, 'Please  _  on me as if I am alive, not dead.'\" Jerry survived  thanks to  the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude. Attitude, after all, is  _  .",
