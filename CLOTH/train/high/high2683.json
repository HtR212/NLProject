I had that feeling  once again  in Venice while on a tour of Italy's famous sites in 2006. I had taken refuge from the  _  in a quiet cafe. Outside, there was an old woman kneeling on the hard, ancient paving stones,  _  . Steady  _  of tourists were walking past her. A young backpacker stood away from the crowd,  _  drinking in the vistas(, ), but I noticed the young traveler was also  _  the old woman. A tourist group walked along the street,  glanced at  the woman and walked on.  _  group of tourists arrived and walked past the old lady. The backpacker watched  _  everybody else went on their way, focused on the  _  around them. Then, I was preparing to leave when I caught sight of the backpacker stepping forward and  _  some money in the woman's cup. He did this somewhat  _  just before the arrival of another tourist group. As I  _  , the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and  _  some more coins to the cup.
