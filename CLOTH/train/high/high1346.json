    "article": "It takes plenty of time for some adults to try to stop children playing. They are usually people who think of play as being the  _  of work and therefore a waste of time. For humans, work is a way of getting food to eat, and like humans,  _  must spend time doing the  _  things. Regardless of this, children  _  playing, and so do other young animals. It is quite  _  to keep both a small child and a young cat  _  for hours with a piece of paper.\nHunting may be the most obvious skill  _  in play, but it is far from being the only one. Lambs and goat kids play  _  , although as adults they will never  _  anything other than some grass. But for these young animals too,  _  is an important part of learning. Sheep and goats are  _  hill and mountain animals. Running and skipping exercise young legs and develop a strong sense of  _  that will keep them safe on the steepest rocks.\n  Compared with  animals' play, children's play is not so different.  _  trees and catching flies are not the most obvious training for the adult world, but the flexibility  _  in these activities is similar to that required of a bus driver or businessman.\nWhat we know about animals shows us that playing is a very good way of  _  , so maybe one of the best ways for  _  to learn is also by playing. Children find playing is fun, but  _  notice that they are also learning at the same time. Most people continue to play games long after they have become  _  , and perhaps that is because we rely so much on our  _  to learn.",
