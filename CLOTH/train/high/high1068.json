On April 22, one day before his 441 birthday anniversary, experts  _  that one of the most recognizable  _  of William Shakespeare is a fake . This  _  that we no longer have a good  _  of what Shakespeare looked like. \"It's very possible that many pictures of Shakespeare are unreliable because many of them are  _  of this one,\" said an expert from Britain's National Portrait Gallery. The  _  comes after four months of testing. Experts from the gallery say the image -- commonly known as the \"Flower portrait\" -- was actually  _  in the 1800s, two centuries  _  Shakespeare's death. The art experts who work at the gallery say they used modern chemistry technology to  _  the paint on the picture. These checks found traces of paint deep in the picture  dating from  about 1814. Shakespeare  died  in 1616, and the date that appears on the portrait is 1609. \"We now think the portrait dates back to around 1818 to 1840. This was  _  there was a new interest in Shakespeare's  _  ,\" Tanya Cooper, the gallery's 16 century curator said. The  _  picture has often been used as a cover for  _  of his plays. It is called the \"Flower portrait\" because one of its  _  Desmond Flower, gave it to the Royal Shakespeare Company. \"There have always been  _  about the authenticity of the painting,\" said David Howells, curator for the Royal Shakespeare Company. \"Now we know the truth, we can put the image in its proper place in the history of Shakespearean portraiture ,\" he said. Two other images of Shakespeare are also being studied as part of the investigation and the results will  come out  later in May. But for now what Shakespeare really looked like will remain a  _  .",
