Go to get them.\" She    _   to a sign  on the door.\"There's no one here except you and me and I'm not your servant.40 _ yourself a basket and start filling.\" \nThe store was a   _  .I searched shelf after shelf and when I finally   _   it, I was exhausted and it was already sundown.\nI visited Miss Bee's,    _   with my list, twice a week that summer.Sometimes she short-charged me.Other times she overcharged   _   sold me an old newspaper instead of one that was current.Going to the store was more like going into  _  . Every time I told her that she had overcharged, she just looked at me  _  her glasses and fixed the price.The moment I remembered the location of an item.Miss Bee rearranged the shelves and made me   _  for it all over again.By summer's end the shopping trip that had   at one time   taken me an hour was done in 15 minutes.\nOn my last trip to the store.Miss Bee asked: \"What did you  _   this summer?\" That you're mean!
