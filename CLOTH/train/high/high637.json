    "article": "A woman professor was giving a lesson to her students on stress management. As she raised a glass of water, everyone in the class   _   they would be asked the \"half-empty or half-full\" question. \n  _  , with a smile on her face, she asked the students, \"How   _   do you think this glass of water weighs?\"\nAnswers called out   _   from 100ml to 300ml.\nShe quieted the students down and then replied, \"It does not matter on the   weight. It 45 _  on how long you hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it is OK. If I hold it for an hour, I will have an ache in my right   _   . If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb. In each case, the   _  of the glass of water doesn't change, but the    _   I hold it, the heavier it becomes. Why?\"\nLost in   _   , all the students kept silent and listened to the professor carefully. \n\"Our   _   and worries in life are like that glass of water. If we   _   our burdens all the time, sooner or later, we will feel exhausted, even   _   to carry on.\n  _   you have to do is put all your burdens down, as 54 _  in the evening as possible. Don't carry   _   through the evening into the night; by doing this, we can get   _  next morning and are able to move forward.\nMore   _   than not, life gets terrible when we think too much. And the moment you   let go of  your burdens, you'll find yourself feeling so much more relaxed.\nSo rather than being upset and feeling    _   for yourself, start doing something about it. After all, life is too short to   _   yourself to anything that is not making you happy.",
