    "article": "When it comes to friends, people always know this old saying----A friend in need is a friend indeed. The best friend a man has in the world may  turn against  him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has  brought up  with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good reputation, may  _  our faith. A man may  _  the money he has. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are ready to fall on their knees to do us  _  when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of hatred when  _  settles its cloud upon our heads. The one  _  unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world, the one that never  _  him, the one that never proves  _  or distrusted, is his dog. A man's dog stands by him in richness and in  _  , in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the cold wind blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his  _  side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to  _  ; he will lick the wounds and sores that come from encounter with the roughness of the world. He will guard the sleep of his master  as if  he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he  _  . When wealth and reputation fall to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journeys through the heavens. If fortune drives the master forth, a deserted person in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of  _  him, to guard him against danger, to fight against his  _  . And when the last  _  of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace, and his body is  _  in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends  _  their ways, there by the grave will the  _  dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even in death.",
