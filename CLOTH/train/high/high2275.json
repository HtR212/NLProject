However, when he was about 2 years of age, he began to regress  suddenly. Soon came the   _   news that Jonathan suffered from severe autism  .\nWe signed him up for some activities. When Jonathan first 43 _  a running club, he struggled hard. For the first couple of weeks. Jonathan could 44 _  run 10 yards without stopping, or wanting to    lie down    . In fact, Mom began running    side by side   with Jonathan, helping him all the way. The head coach asked Mom not to    give up    and worked with her to help Jonathan continue   _    . Coach Vincent believed in Jonathan and promised to    _   him 3 times a week. After several months, Jonathan began to   _   well in the training. And Jonathan was very   _   that he was able to tie his shoelaces at last. This was something that took him 10 long years to   _   . After only a year of training, we were   _   to see that Jonathan took part in 5k and 10 k races regularly and became a(n)   _   .\nOn November 2,2008 Jonathan completed his first marathon in 4 hours and 48 minutes. Our     _   was in the audience, about 100 yards from the finish line when my parents and I saw a   _     but strong Jonathan coming around the corner.
