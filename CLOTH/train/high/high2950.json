This will be a very  _  trip for me as, for the first time ever, I will not be  _  to my hometown. You see, my parents sold their house in my hometown and moved about 500 kilometers away.\nAs it  _  me that I would be returning to a whole new place, I was  _  with two questions: Do I still have a hometown? Where is my home? I needed to do some research.\nAfter reading A Story from the Chinese Diaspora, I learned I was not alone in feeling  _  about where I call home. In the story, a Chinese American girl  _  with finding her identity and  _  her past with her present. I realized the place we live now and the place we lived then, have a great  _  over who we are, where we long to be and where we feel  _  and safety.\nBack to My Motherland  _  of a woman who left her motherland years ago and started a new life in America--the place she now calls home. But,  _  some people move on from their hometown and  _  a new life somewhere else, others have a strong  _  to the city that they grew up in.

He makes it his  _  to give back to the community that has given so much to him and his family.\nAs I  count down  the days until I head back to my motherland and  _  where exactly my home is, I am  _  to decide where my heart is. And quite  _  , my heart is wherever I am.",
