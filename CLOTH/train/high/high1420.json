I went to the  _  to have one last talk with God. \"Can you give me one good  _  not to quit?\" His answer surprised me. \"Look around. Do you see the fern and the bamboo? When I planted their seeds, I took good care of them.The fern quickly grew from the earth.  _  nothing came from the bamboo seed. During the following three years, the fern grew more plentiful. And  _  , nothing came from the bamboo seed. But I did not quit on the bamboo. Then in the fifth year a  _  sprout emerged from the earth. Compared to the fern it was  _  small and insignificant. But just 6 months later the bamboo  _  to over 100 feet tall. It had spent the five years growing  _  . Those roots made it strong and gave it  _  it needed to survive. I wouldn't give any of my creations a challenge it could not  _  .\" He said to me. \"All this time you have been struggling, you have  _  been growing roots. I would not quit on the bamboo.  _  will I ever quit on you. Don't  _  yourself with others.The bamboo had a different  _  from the fern. Yet they both make the forest beautiful. Your time will  _  . You will rise high! \" \"How high should I rise?\" I asked. \"How high will the bamboo rise?\" He asked  in turn  . \"As high as it can?\" I  _  . \"Yes,\" He said. \"Give me glory  _  rising as high as you can.\" I left the forest and bring back this story. I hope it can help you see that God will never  give up  on you. Never regret a day in your life. Good days give you happiness. Bad days give you  _  . Both are necessary to life.",
