At first, I am excited to see that I can get a front row spot until I realize that I am not yet a   _  .\nFor high school students, senior year is probably the only time when someone can be dressed in   _   clothes instead of uniform, and given priority  for   _   time in school canteen. Even some of them can shout at juniors and it doesn't seem   _  . However, the more I think about it, the more   _  . I think of why we should not have the fixed senior parking area.\nFirstly, there is only one specific area under the light poles to which senior parking signs are   _  . As a result, it is difficult for one to   _   how far back they must park. The whole thing seems too much of an inconvenience 44 rather than  a convenience.\nSecondly, it does not seem   _   for those who get to school early. They could have a  46 _  near the front but instead they must park near the back. It is even less   _   when it is raining or snowing and students who   show up   to school early must walk further across the parking lot because they are not a senior.\nLastly, no matter how hard the school tries to   _   senior parking, there will always be those freshmen who   _   to park in the senior parking spaces, regardless of the   _  .
