Due to a medical misdiagnosis, she had been sightless, and she was   _   thrown into a world of darkness, anger and   _  . And all she had to   depend on   was her husband, Mark, who was an Air Force officer.\nWhen she first lost her sight, he was   _   to help his wife gain the strength and confidence. Soon,Susan felt ready to return to her job, but how would she get there since she used to take the bus? So Mark volunteered to   _   her to work each day,  even though   they worked at opposite ends of the city.   _  , Mark wanted Susan herself to take the bus again.\nShe responded, \"I'm blind. I feel you're  _   me.\"\nMark's heart   _   hearing these words, but he promised to ride the bus with her, until Susan got the hang of it. He taught her how to rely on her other   _  , to determine where she was and how to adjust to her new   _  .\nFinally, Susan was ready to   _   on her own. Monday   _   arrived, and for the first time they went their   _   ways. Each day on her own went perfectly.\nOne morning, Susan was taking the bus to work as usual when the driver said:\"Madam, I do envy you.\"   _  , she asked the driver, \"Why?\"\nThe driver answered, \"Every morning for the past week, a gentleman has been watching you as you   get off  the bus and cross the street safely   _   you enter your office building. Then he blows you a kiss, gives you a   _   and walks away.\"\nTears of   _   poured down Susan's cheeks. She was so lucky, for Mark had given her    gift more   _   than sight, a gift of love that can bring light where there is darkness.",
