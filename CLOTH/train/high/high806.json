    "article": "It was Thanksgiving morning. In the crowded kitchen of my small house I was busy preparing the traditional Thanksgiving turkey  _  the doorbell rang. I opened the front door and saw two small children in  _  clothes and thin little sandals , staying together at the door on the top step.\n\"Any old  _  , lady?\" asked one of them.\nI was  _  . I wanted to say \"no\" until my eye  fellon  their sandals, which were wet with heavy snow.\n\"  Come in  and I'll make you a cup of hot cocoa.\"\nThey walked  _  and sat down at the table. Their wet sandals left marks on the  _  . I served them cocoa and bread with jam to fight  _  the freezing cold outside.  _  I went back to the kitchen and started again on my household budget for Thanksgiving Day.\nThe silence in the front room struck me. I looked in. The girl held the empty cup in her hands, looking at it. The boy asked in a  _  voice,\"Lady, are you  _  ?\" \"Am I rich? Pity. No!\"\nI looked at my old sofa covers. The girl put her cup back in its saucer   _  and said,  \"Your cups match your saucers.\" Her voice was flat with a need that no amount of food could supply. They left after that,  _  their papers against the wind. They hadn't said \"Thank you.\" They didn't need to. They had  _  me that I had so much to be grateful for. Plain blue China cups and saucers were  _  worth five pence. But they matched.\nI tasted the potatoes and the meat soup. Potatoes and brown meat soup, a roof over our heads, my man with a good and steady job--these  _  ,too.\nI moved the chairs back from the fire and  _  the living room. The muddy   _  of small sandals were still wet on my floor. Let them remain for a while, I thought, just in case I should begin to  _  how rich I am.",
