    "article": "Good friends mean a lot in our life. I used to have some friends who I could  count on  . It was my 4th grade in the elementary school that I had my two friends Nina and Nancy. I had known them since the first grade and we had gotten along quite well. Now the memory of their appearance is still  _  in my mind. The following year I went to a new school. I was shy and didn't  _  much. The first day I made no new friend and I felt  _  . The next day right after school as we were waiting for our school  _  , I felt someone  _  on my hair, I quickly turned \"Why did you do that? \" \"I'm sorry I was stretching. \"Giving her a  _  look, I turned around without saying anything. I had seen my teacher's eyes  _  so I didn't want to get into  _  . Then I felt a  _  on my shoulder and turned around again. \"What is it? \"\"Well umm . . . I have seen you for the first time. For the reason that I was  _  yesterday I was wondering if you're a new student. \"I nodded  _  and she smiled \"Welcome to De Zavala Primary School! I'm Alondra, nice to meet you! \"Then the school bus came and we got on. And that's how it all  _  . She was a warm-hearted girl  _  she introduced me to new people and I made a lot of new friends! And I swore I would  care for  them because they saved me from the  _  and they didn't even know. One day, when we were in the 8th grade, Alondra told me she had always wanted a best friend and then I  _  along. I felt so  _  to hear about it. Now I'm in the college and I  _  have many friends: Logan, Mari, Amold, Maggie, and those whose  _  you don't know.",
