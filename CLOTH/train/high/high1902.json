There was not a scar in it. Suddenly, an old man appeared and said, \"Your heart is not as   _   as mine.\"   \nThe crowd and the young man looked at the old man's heart. It was full of   _  , and it had places where pieces had been taken out and other pieces 34 _  in, but they didn't fit quite right. In fact, in some places there were deep gaps where whole pieces were   _  . \nThe young man laughed. \"  _   your heart with mine, mine is perfect and yours is full of scars.\" \"Yes,\" said the old man, \"Yours is perfect but I would never 37 _  with you. You see, every scar stands for a person to whom I have given my 38 _ . I tear  out a piece of my heart and give it to them, 39 _  often they give me a piece of their heart that fits into the   _   place in my heart. But because the pieces aren't exact, I have some rough edges, which I cherish , because they show me the love we 41 _ . Sometimes I have given pieces of my heart   _  , but the other person hasn't 43 _  a  piece of his or her heart to me. These are the empty gaps -- giving love is taking a chance.   _   gaps stay open, they make me remember the love I have for those people too, and I hope someday they may return and 45 _  the space. So now do you see what true beauty is?\"  \n    The young man walked up to the old man,   reached into   his perfect heart, and tore a piece out. He \n  _   it to the old man. The old man placed it in his heart, then took a piece from his old   _  \nheart and placed it in the young man's heart. The young man looked at his heart, not perfect anymore but more beautiful than ever, since love from the old man's heart   _   into his.\nHow sad it must be to 50 go through  a life with a whole untouched heart!",
