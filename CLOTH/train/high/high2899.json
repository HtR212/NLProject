    "article": "Ann and the children and I moved from our rural home in Virginia so that I could retrain for a new career. It meant   _   our best friend behind, Zachary, a six-year-old black dog. This was for his good; he would be miserably penned up in suburban Birmingham   _   we were away from home every day. We all agreed that he should remain free and   _   the countryside. We found friends of friends, far across the county, over a   _  , beyond the highway. They would be glad to give him a new home. He   _   beside me as I drove him there. And I left him tearfully, watching him on his new front porch, disappearing in the   _   of the rear view mirror   as I drove away from him forever. \nA year later, in our new home, we got a call from the people who bought our farmhouse and Ann   _   the phone. \"There's a strange black dog   _   up here a couple days ago. He's right   _   and his paws don't look so good. He just seems sort of   _   and confused. The neighbors down the road   _   he's your old dog. \"\n\"It's Zachary and he found his way home. He's looking for us. Fred, you have to go get him.\" Ann said through tears of joy and   _  . The next day, driven by forces   _   reason, my daughter and I drove ten hours to our old farmhouse.\nAnd it was Zach for sure, though   _   of him than we had left, and he was confused when he first saw us. But as he   _   us, he responded to all of the commands he once obeyed, as if we had never been   _  .\nIt was   _   that his travels had taken him months. And yet he had persisted, driven by the need to find his pack, his neck-huggers and playmates; his family. It was not enough to get these things from the family of strangers who treated him   _   enough, but were not his. To find his true home must have been a driving 54 _  in his mind from that first week with his new family. He waited and waited,   _   knowing one day that I was not coming back for him and he would have to make the trip back to us on his own.",
