She didn't demand very much from him---\"Study hard, and get the best  _  you can,\" she told him. She tried to get it into his head that she didn't have the  _  for his college education. Not a cent could be expected!  Instead of  studying harder, Kyle spent hour after hour playing video games on his computer. He always waited until the last minute to study for school  _  , and stayed up all night cramming  for them. When Jane tried to  _  him that he needed good grades to get a  _  , he would turn a deaf ear to her or even get angry. He said it was her  _  to take care of him financially  _  he graduated from college.\n\"Where did he get that  _  ?\" Luke asked. \"You've  _  him for 10 years all by yourself. You don't  _  him a thing. He should be glad you haven't kicked him out of the apartment. When I was in the eleventh grade, my father made it  _  to me that when I graduated from high school, I was expected to leave home.  _  Kyle thinks you have to pay his way through college!\"\nJane would  _  Luke to talk to Kyle. \"He says you're not his father, so why should he have to listen to you?\"\n\"Well, his father's dead. He should appreciate that I'm  _  to try to help him. \"Luke said.\n\"Kyle will be able to learn to accept your help and advice  in time  . But before that, Luke, we need to try hard to get him to accept you in his heart, close to the  _  of his own father.\"\n\"I agree and we surely have every confidence in him.\" said Luke.\n\"Yes. And in  _  , too!\" Jane reminded him.",
