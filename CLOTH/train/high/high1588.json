    "article": "Those days life was so hard that I finally wished that I could just be \"left alone\". The thought of going somewhere by myself would give me so much  _  . but then I'd remember when I was alone. Not that  _  left me. I was alone by myself in crowded places. It was the  _  that I built around me that would not  _  the outside in or the inside out. When I was a child, I would play this silly  _  . It was always  _  because a place in a corner or under a table would do. My favorite place was simply to pull a blanket over my head. I would lie there and  _  , \"Right now no one in the world knows where I am!\" That thought was so  _  . If you knew me well enough this wouldn't  _  you...I still do it at 60. It drives my dogs crazy, because they find me and start digging at the blanket until they find a way in. All three of them  _  me. That thought is so satisfying, too. I want you to know that at times we all wish that we could be left  _  . The fact that you can be alone with yourself and enjoy it shows clearly who you are. Imagine for a  _  being locked in a room with someone you  _  . It would be torture. So, if you find peace with being with yourself, that is good. However, if you are trying to build a wall so no one can ever  get in  , it can't happen. The light of love can find a  way  through the tiniest cracks. You can pull the covers over your head and love will find you.",
