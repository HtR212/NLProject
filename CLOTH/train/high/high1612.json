    "article": "I grew up one of ten children on a farm in Wyoming.After my dad's service in World War II,he was  _  again to fight during the Korean War,and when he returned home,he couldn't drink  _  to numb his terrible memories.He struggled to  _  for his growing family. On our occasional trips to town,I  _  out boxfuls of books from the library.When I opened a book,I could  _  myself in unknown places--where children weren't hungry and were in  _  of little. When I wasn't daydreaming,my  _  was the life I shared with my brothers and sisters.At night I hid under the covers  _  to silence the sounds of life in an alcoholic home.Classmates asked  _  we didn't have electricity or a telephone.I suppose my explanations were  _  more than lies,but the stories I told improved  _  every book I read. Starting at a very young age,my siblings and I sometimes got jobs to earn money--to put more food on the family table.We  _  newspapers,babysat,and cleaned other people's houses. Mom grew vegetables,raised chickens,and baked bread,so we seldom went hungry,even when supper was only a pot of beans.  _  my real hunger wasn't for food--it was a hunger for a better life.It was a hunger for knowledge about the world  _  our simple existence.It was a hunger to prove Dad  _  when he told us we would never amount to anything. Hunger motivated my brothers and sisters to achieve much  _  than our parents expected  _  us.We devoured the offerings of the public schools because we realized that  _  would be our steppingstone into a brighter future. Now I'm  _  of the accomplishments of my siblings:an art professor;a wellknown doctor;plus business owners.And me,I'm the keeper of the family stores.I'll never know if we would have so many accumulated successes if we had not known  _  as children.But this I do know:I believe it can be a good thing.",
