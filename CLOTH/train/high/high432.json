    "article": "Hi Zhou Ling,\n   How are you? I haven't heard from you for weeks. Is everything ok with you?\n   Do you  _  go to the gym\nevery day? I used to go to the  _  three time a week, but I\ndon't\n  work out  any more. I know another way to  _  slim. Looking good is important to women, isn't it\n?\n  _  young women want a slim figure these days,  _  here in Canada. I'm trying to lose\nweight because I'm so ashamed of my body.  _  I'm\npreparing to act in a new TV show, I'm\ntaking weight-loss pills called Fat-Less, which are quite  _  with young women here. I hope to\nlose at least 10 kilograms.\n   I take two pills a day and don't need to exercise.\n   The pills really  _  ! I'm becoming\nslimmer and slimmer. I've lost 7 kilograms in the last\ntwo months. However, sometimes I don't feel so energetic. My mother, who you met last year, \nkeeps telling me not to take  _  because they are\ndangerous. She says health is the most\nimportant thing, and I agree, but then I look so slim at the moment.",
