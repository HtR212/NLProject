    "article": "For Donna Peters,a dream of living in Cowra comes true. She    _ 4 _  1  for more than a decade that this was where she wanted to live, and since then she has been working to    _    it happen.\nI drove through a few times and loved the      _    of the town. When I drove through the town the second or third time,I    _  ,'I love this town and I am going to move here.'\"she said.\nDonna moved here in May    _   everything seemed to fall into place.\n\"I had been coming down once a month for a while looking for houses,I    worked out    one and applied for this job at the same time and it all    _  .I would have moved here anyway    _   I hadn't got a good job,\" she said.\nSince moving to town Donna has been able to boat down the Lachlan River, try out a few of the local bush-walking tracks and is    49    learning new things. Donna's friends and family have     _    her a few times since she moved to town, and they love it    _   .Some of her visitors have even    _    to move here.\n\"I have a few friends looking for    _    around town, my son(27) has even told me that he thinks he might like to live here,\" she said.\nDonna would love to see Cowra    _   itself as a great tourism destination.\n\"There is so much here and it is a     _    that people just drive through on their way to one of the other towns. I think Cowra has so much     _    and should make the most of that,\" she said.\nDonna turned down the opportunity to   57 _  a life coach seminar with work recently because she doesn't need anyone to tell her   _   to work towards her goals. Her      _    finally has been turned into reality and she    _    to stay in Cowra forever.",
