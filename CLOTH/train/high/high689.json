There are more than one billion people in the world who live without  _  drinking water. The United Nations  _  to cut this number in half by 2015. Solving such a big problem seems like a(n)  _  challenge. But everyone,  _  teenagers, can do something to help. A teenage girl in the US has set an example to the  _  of her age around the world. Rene Haggerty, 13, was awarded the 2004 Gloria Barron Prize for her work--  _  discarded batteries which pollute water. In 2003, Haggerty went on a field trip to the Great Lakes Science Centre in Ohio. There she saw an exhibit about how  _  Haggerty learnt that  _  the batteries was an easy solution. \"I think everybody can do it, because everyone  _  batteries, and it can make a big difference.\" With these words, she began to  _  awareness in her area. She  talked to  her county government and school board. She got permission to start a recycling programme in schools  as well as  the public library, hospital, and churches. With help from her family, friends and local waste-management  _  , she gathered containers, arranged transportation, and made a(n)  _  video. Over the past two years, she collected four tons of batteries and drew the attention of officials, who were in charge of a battery recycling programme but had made  _  progress. When asked  _  she feels like a hero, Haggerty is quite  _  . \"Not really. Well, maybe for the fish I saved!\" Every year the Gloria Barron Prize  _  young Americans aged 8 to 18 who have shown leadership and courage in  _  the public and the planet. Each year ten winners receive US $ 2,000 each, to help with their education costs or their public service work.",
