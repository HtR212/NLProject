    "article": "April Fool's Day is a western festival. No one  _  exactly when and how April Fool's Day began. However, there are some stories about   _   it came into being. One story  _  like this: in the sixteenth-century France, the start of the new year was on April first. It was celebrated   _  much the same way   _   it is today with parties and dancing into the late hours of the night. Then in 1562, Pope   Gregory introduced a new calendar  for the Christian world, and the new year fell on January first. There were some people,  _  , who hadn't heard or didn't believe the   _  in the date, so they   _  to celebrate New Year's Day on April first.   _   played tricks on them and called them \"April fools\". They tried to make them believe that something false was  _  . In France today, April first is called \"April Fish\". French children fool their friends by taping a paper fish to their friends'   _   .When the \"young fool\"  _  this trick, the prankster  shouts \"April Fish!\"\nToday Americans play small tricks on friends and strangers alike on the first of April. One   _    trick on April Fool's Day is   pointing down   to a friend's shoe and saying, \"Your shoelace is united  .\" School children might tell a classmate that school has been canceled.  _  the trick is, if you fail for the joke the prankster shouts \"April Fool!\" \nIn Britain today, on the first of April, even   _  newspapers, radio and TV programs tell big lies. You   _  read a science  _  showing that doctors have found a way to cure AIDS,   _   you would probably listen to a piece of news about an UFO   _   on an island.",
