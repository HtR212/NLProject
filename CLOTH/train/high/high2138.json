    "article": "When I stopped by to get a newspaper, a tall, sincere man came over to me asking for help with directions. With a printout of Google maps, he was looking for a  hotel  on the main street, but just couldn't find it. After checking out his written directions, I mapped it  _  my phone and showed him  _  where he needed to go. He, in  _  , mentioned that he had tried going there, but there was no such street number and he just couldn't locate his hotel.I  _  it again for him.He thanked me with a big smile, shook my hand, and  took off  .I got into my car and he got into his, and we  _  ways.As I drove to the next grocery store and went in, I sensed  _  wrong about the directions-so I Googled the address again and  _  that he was looking for the right address but in a city half an hour away!  _  it had been several minutes, the chances of finding him miles away-where he was surely still looking around-were  _  .But I thought I'd give it a(an)  _  and set off in that direction. I'd  _  noticed what his car looked like, and was just about to give up.I parked my car as I considered what else I could do-  _  , like magic, he drove right by and pulled over into a nearby parking spot, still  at a loss  about where the hotel was. When I  pulled in  next to him, he couldn't believe it: \"  _  did you find me?!\" he asked.\"I'm not sure, but I  figured out  that you are in the wrong city!\" I showed him the right directions, and after more  _  and a handshake, we  waved goodbye  .Likely that we'll never meet again, and that makes it much more sweet.",
