    "article": "I thought my luck had run out at the end of the summer holiday. It was not the  _  of the new term that did it, but the  _  military training. My  _  nightmare had finally come true. The weather was  _  hot when we were training. Sweat dropped from every part of my body. I  _  as if my mouth was going to catch fire.  _  was the only thing I could think about. It was the first time in my life that I have ever really felt  _  . However, we had to stand completely  _  all day. The drill-master were very strict with us. They only  _  us to sit directly on the ground for a few minutes. My heels ached and I had a blister on my  _  . Believe me, this was not the most  _  part. What I couldn't  _  most of all was the smell of the toilets. It left such a deep impression on me that I can almost smell it right now.I guess most of the other students  _  the same experience that I had. I often thought of giving up and going back home.  _  , I didn't. One day, our PE teacher came to watch our  _  for a while. Then he  picked me out  to join the national flag squad . \"You movement is the best of all,\" he praised me. It was so  _  ! I almost couldn't believe my ears. It was a great honor to be chosen for the squad. From that day on, I worked much harder than before because I knew I was going to  _  the national flag. Every Monday, thousands of eyes would be  _  on me. Now military training has finished and I have become a flag protector in my school. Every time I raise the flag, I know all my hard work has  paid off",
