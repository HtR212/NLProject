I quickly slowed down and  turned on  my headlights. Seeing the road ahead was a  _  . I felt as if I had been transported into a shadow world. Everywhere I looked was only dark grayness. Even the trees lining the road had become frightening,  _  me of some frightening stories. I drove on and on through the waves of dark and wondered if it would end.\nAfter a while, though, the sun broke through the fog and the world was transformed. The golden light beams  _  the landscape. The red and yellow leaves shone on the  _  . The river along the road shone in the sunshine. Everything seemed full of  _  and joy again. I smiled and drove, singing a song in my heart. I thanked God for both the sunshine and the  _  , because he reminded me again of just how  _  this world can be. In our lives the fog can roll in sometimes too. Things can go  _  . Problems can appear.\nDifficulties, pains and troubles can seem to  _  us and block out all the light in our life.\nWhen this happens and the world seems  _  in gray, we need to remember that we can break through the fog. We can  _  the shadows away with love. We can transform the world with our joy. We also can light a way through the dark for others to follow. God is willing to  _  our souls with his love and light. All he asks is that we share their shine. May all of your foggy days be  _  then. May your soul shine brightly. And may you forever struggle to live in God's light.",
