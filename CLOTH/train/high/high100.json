For him, getting up at 5 a.m. and working a couple of hours before I went to school, and then  _  more after school until there was not enough  _  to see, were normal. My father considered putting good work ethics in me to be very  _  . He began to show me these, not through  _  , but through his actions. He would not  _  a job until it was done. He  _  put his all into everything he did. However, he showed me this not just in working, but in everything. Like when I was in soccer, I wanted to  _  a game once, and he explained to me that I had made a  _  and that even if I just skipped one game, then I did not  _  to play the rest of the games. So the day I started my first job at the age of 14, I was  _  to show my father that I could do it well, and that I was not going to  _  . My entire  _  was to make my father proud of me. I knew that  even if  I did, he would not say it in words, but he would show it. My first job was doing  _  for a company. As most of you know, construction is not an easy job, especially being so  _  . When someone as young as I started working, they would either  _  or get stronger. I got stronger. I worked the  _  I had been taught and I gave that day everything I had. In the end, my boss was  _  . He even called to tell my parents what a good worker I was, and my parents' eyes  _  . From that day on I have worked every job to my full  _  , because that day defined my life. It defined how I was going to work, and I will always stick to it in the rest of my life.",
