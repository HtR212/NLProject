Now Kevin was   _   like a bird.\n              Suddenly the   doorbell   rang. It was his cousin, Max. \"Hi!\" screamed Max as he jumped on to Kevin's bed   _   his crayons   during the process. \"I've come to stay here for the holidays.\"\n              Kevin never expected his mother's surprise to be so   _  . After breakfast Kevin   _   to do some painting.   _   Max was not around. When he was doing the finishing touches, Max entered and spilled some juice all over the painting,   _   ruining it. \n              The next day was even   _   for him.\n              It all   _   when Max put the dirty clothes in the washing machine. After some time Kevin heard some   _   sounds from the machine and he found that Max had put his shoes into the machine. One day, a piece of   _   caught Kevin's attention. \"The world famous collector Dick Brown's stamps have been   _  .\" \n              Kevin had a stamp collection and it was with his friend Allan. So, Kevin gave Max the   _   and sent him to get his album back. Max soon came back with the album and Kevin found it was not his album --- it   _   valuable stamps. Actually Max had gone to another   _   whose door was unlocked by mistake and found an album which resembled Kevin's and brought it back. Kevin   _   that it might be the album belonging to Dick Brown. Kevin called the   _   and told them he had found a valuable album. A week had passed since that incident, and Kevin and Max were   _   for finding Dick Brown's album.\n              \"I'll never be   _   with Max,\" Kevin thought.",
