    "article": "Before my recent graduation, the last project of the term was called \"Smile\". The class was asked to go out and  _  at three people and record their  _  . Soon after we were given the  _  , my husband and I went out to McDonald's one cold morning. We were standing in  _  , waiting to be  _  , when suddenly everyone around us began to back away. A feeling of  _  rose up inside of me as I wondered what happened. As I  _  around I smelled a horrible dirty smell. Behind me were two poor homeless men. As I looked at the short man close to me, he was smiling and his blue eyes searched for  _  . He said \"Good day\" as he  _  the few coins. The waitress asked him what they wanted. He said, \"Coffee is all, Miss.\" That was all they could  _  . I  _  felt the urge and actually hugged him. That was  _  I noticed all the eyes in the restaurant were set on  me  . I smiled and asked the waitress for two more breakfast meals on  _  trays . I then walked to the table that the men had  _  as a resting spot. I put the trays on the table and laid my  _  on the short man's cold hand. He said \"Thank you\" with tears in his eyes. I  handed in  this story as my project. My instructor read it and said, \"Can I  _  this with your classmates?\" I nodded. At that moment I found something more  _  than a simple smile. I graduated with one of the most important  _  I would ever learn, unconditional acceptance.",
