    "article": "I lost my elderly mother a few weeks ago. Actually, my mother had fallen over during the night and had not been able to  get up  again. She had woken up the neighbors by banging on the wall. The  _  called an ambulance, which took her  _  to the hospital.\nMy mother has  _  thought that hospitals are frightening. She believes that doctors and hospitals give you  _  diseases. My father went to hospital a year ago, and after a few weeks, he  passed away  . The fact that he was also in the final  _  of lung cancer was certainly related, but by my mother's logic, my father's death was  _  with the hospital.\nWhen a neighbor  _  me up and told me that my mother had been taken off in an ambulance, the first thing I did was similar, which was to ring Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The paramedics  had told my neighbor that my mother would  _  be taken there,  _  I was told that no one by that name had been  _  , so they gave me the numbers of two other West Midland hospital. They didn't  _  they were holding my mother. I rang the  _  and asked them to find her, but the nice officer said he could only do that if she had been reported as a(n)  _  person.\nIt took six calls to  _  my mother. She had been in Queen Elizabeth Hospital all along, but because their computer system hadn't been updated overnight , there was no record of her  _  . My mother had spent more than a  _  in the hospital when it turned out there was nothing  _  with her. I managed to get her out within 10 days, but only by agreeing that in the future, she would live downstairs. In return, the hospital said they would  _  for a social worker to visit the house three or four times a day.\nLuckily, my mother is safe. Thank all the people who have given their help to us .",
