They were would-be poets, novelists, and essayists. They were extraordinary in their    _    to put the English language to its best use. These promising young men   _   regularly to read and critique   each other's work. And critique it they did!\nThese men were merciless with one another. They   _   the minutest literary expression into a hundred pieces. They were heartless, tough, even mean in their   _   .The sessions became such areas of literary criticism that the 41 _  of this special club called themselves the \"Stranglers  \".\nIn order to   _   , the women of literary talent in the university   _   to start a club of their own, one comparable to the Stranglers. They   _   themselves the \"Wranglers  \".They, too, read their   _   one another. But there was one great difference. The criticism was much softer, more   _   , more encouraging. Sometimes, there was almost no criticism at all. Every effort, even the weakest one, was    _   .\nTwenty years later an alumnus (;) of the university was making an exhaustive (;)   _    of his classmates' careers when he    _    a vast difference in the literary accomplishments of the Stranglers as opposed to the Wranglers.

From the Wranglers had come six or more successful    _   , some of national renown (;) such as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, who wrote The Yearling.\nTalent between the two?Probably the same. Level of    _   ?Not much difference. But the Stranglers were strangled, while the Wranglers were determined to give each other a(an)    _   .The Stranglers    _    an atmosphere of argument and self-doubt. The Wranglers highlighted the best, not the worst.",
