When people are   in need of  (17)information ,from weather forecasts to   _  (18)research, the Internet is now the first place that many people   turn to  (19).With the   _  (20) of a button or the click of a mouse , a student can   _  (21)knowledge from the information held in the largest libraries and museums in the world .\nAnother truly wonderful   _  (22)of the Internet is the way people use it to build social ties. One of the greatest   _  (23)of Internet friendships is that they are   based on  (24)common interests, rather than appearance, age or popularity. Young people from different   _  (25)and different countries can form lifelong friendships.\nThe Internet also has its negative effects on our lives.\nThe   _  (26)  is that it is difficult to   _  (27) whether the information is true and accurate. The   _  (28) of false information on the Internet becomes more of a problem every day . This is very   _  (29)because people can write anything they want,and we cannot always tell if the information is true or not .\nAnother disadvantage of the Internet is that it is affecting people's   _  (30)lives.

Now ,  instead of  (32)spending time together in the evenings, some families spend their time   _  (33)because one or more members are using the computer.   In fact  (34) some young people spend so much time   playing  (35)computer games and using the Internet that they have become addicted to computer games.",
