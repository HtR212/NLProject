    "article": "Last week after a long day of traveling, I found myself delayed at a bus station. The bus was running two hours late! I was a little  _  and had to wait there reading a book. Just then a woman  came up  and asked me if I had any spare change to help her  _  a bus ticket. \"Oh, sure,\" I said. With the words, I reached into my bag for some  _  . As I handed her five dollars I  _  her stomach rumble and I knew she was very  _  . I then reached back into my  _  and brought out a Danish pastry I had bought earlier and  _  it to her with a smile. She took the pastry and gave me a bus ticket to Milwaukee to show her  _  . I don't live in Milwaukee and the ticket will probably  _  be used, but I took it. A look of  _  spread over her face. Then she went to get her  _  and I went back to my  _  . She came back a few  _  later, apologized, and told me there were five dollars  _  . I gave her the money and slipped a twenty  as well  . She thanked me and went back to the counter.  _  I went back to my book. Five minutes later she came back again and  _  to return my twenty.  _  I said it was for her so she could get something else to eat and that I wasn't taking it back, she  _  crying and hugged me. From then on, I always help others in trouble, because I believe I am really making a difference to them!",
