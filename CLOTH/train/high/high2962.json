Person B hurries to answer the door, only to find that no one's there. After the  _  thing is repeated several times, this is called \"ding dong ditch\". Sharon Mardis, a single mother of four, told ABC News that she  _  a \"ding dong ditch\" when she  _  to her door at 1:00 am last night. \"My doorbell started ringing,  _  I came to the door,\" Sharon told ABC News. \"There was  _  at the door. I went back in the house. I got ten or twenty  _  and the doorbell started ringing again. I came back to the door, still nobody at the door.\" She got  _  and stepped outside, shouting, \"Who's that? What on earth are you going to do?\" There was just  _  . But after Sharon returned to the house, she  _  something. Smoke! Sharon quickly  _  her kids and the family pets and ran out of the house. Only then did she  _  how bad the fire was. The  _  of the house fell down; the house was quickly  _  by flames. The smoke detectors had never  gone off  : they were out of batteries. Good thing for the doorbell. The  _  is who had rung it.  _  found that the flames has fused the wires of the doorbell together, causing it to ring. But  _  , the fire had nothing to do with the doorbell wiring at all. It had started in the bathroom, well down the hall. From there, the flames didn't spread to the nearby  _  , where the children and Sharon were sleeping.  _  , they surprisingly reached the doorbell first, making it ring repeatedly, and  _  Sharon to avoid danger. Sharon believes it happened that way thanks to an angel.",
