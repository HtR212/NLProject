    "article": "Communication with a Stranger\nLast weekend I sat on the bus talking with excitement and so ready to spend time in New York City with one of my best friends from college. As I took the window seat and wore headphones over ears, I almost didn't   _  the elderly man sitting beside me.\nTwo hours passed and I was still absorbed in my own world.   _  the elderly man asked me a question, a simple question   _   the bus's Wi-Fi connection, which turned into a two- hour   _  . In fact, it directly   _   my personal life.\nWe talked a lot about my dreams, my fears and my life. I   _   more with this stranger on the bus than I have with any friend or family member in months. Maybe it had something to do with me just being   _   to let anyone I know close to me. I was   _   that the stranger was not only so deeply interested in getting to know me, but also just as willing to   _   me to my greatest abilities. He listened carefully to every word I said and made some useful   _   at times. Instead of politely   _   his head when I mentioned my major, he told me that my strong liking seemed to be psychology, but not the one I was studying. He said that he knew I would face difficulties if I studied\npsychology and that he fully understood my   _   for the failure.\nThis elderly man made me   _   the plans that I had laid out for my life with just that simple statement. He helped me realize that my neatly   _   plan for the next five years of my life wasn't all that neat, but actually complex and filled with   _  . Most of all, he helped me   _   the complex, not stay away from it because of my fear for the unknown. I   _   a lot from talking with the elderly stranger.\nA few days later, he emailed me, saying, \"I think you're   _   for great things no matter what you decide to do.\" The email was filled with words of   _  . In a few hours a stranger showed me a sense of kindness that made me realize that life is sometimes   _   but it is going to be okay.",
