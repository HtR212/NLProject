    "article": "John and Bobby joined a wholesale company together just after graduation from college the same year.  _  worked very hard. After several years, however, the boss promoted Bobby to the  _  of manager but John remained a(n)  _  employee. John could not take it any more, so he  turned in  his resignation and complained the boss did not know how to  _  hard-working staff. The boss knew John worked very hard for the years. He thought for a moment and said, \" I have a  _  .1 hope you can do one more thing for our company before you leave. Perhaps you will change your  _  .\"John didn't  _  . The boss asked him to go and find out anyone  _  watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. The boss asked  _  it cost per kilogram. John shook his head and went back to the market to ask and returned to  _  to the boss that the melon was $1.2 per kg. The boss told John to wait a second, and he asked Bobby to do the same thing. Bobby went, returned and said, \"Boss, only one person sells watermelons, $1.2 per kg, $10 for 10kg. He has 340 melons  in all  . Every melon weighs about 2 kg, bought from the South two days ago. They are fresh and red, of good quality.\" John was very  _  and realized the  _  between himself and Bobby. He decided not to resign  _  to learn from Bobby. My dear friends, a more successful person is more observant, thinks  _  and explores in depth.  _  exist in the daily details. For the same matter, a more successful person sees more and farther so that he can find out a chance and catch it to  _  his aim. If a person sees one year ahead,  _  another sees only tomorrow, the difference between a year and a day is 365 times, then how  _  you win?",
