    "article": "A few years ago a group of salesmen went to a regional sales meeting in Chicago. They had    _  to their wives that they would be home on Friday evening. In their   _   to catch the plane home, one of these salesmen accidentally kicked over a table which held a display of apples.\nApples flew everywhere. Without   _  or looking back, they almost all managed to reach the plane in time.\nALL BUT ONE! He   _  , took a deep breath, and felt sympathy for the girl whose apple stand had been overturned. He  _  his friends to go on without him, waved good-bye, told one of them to call his wife when they  _  and explain his taking a later flight. Then he   _  to the place where the apples were all over the floor.\nThe girl was  _   blind! She was softly crying, tears running down her cheeks in  _   , and at the same time helplessly groping   for her spilled apples  _  the crowd walked past her, no one stopping or  caring about  her trouble.\nThe salesman knelt on the floor with her,   _   up the apples, put them back on the table and helped  _   her display. As he did this, he  _   that many of them had become bruised  .So he set these   _   in another basket. When he had finished, he pulled out his wallet and said to the girl, \"Here, please take this $40 for the  _  we did.\"\n\"Are you okay?\" She nodded through her tears. \nHe continued, \"I hope we didn't   _   your day too badly.\"\nAs the salesman started to walk away, the confused blind girl called out to him, \"Mister...\" He paused and  _  to look back into those blind eyes. She continued, \"Are you Jesus?\"\nHe stopped and wondered. Then slowly he made his   _   to catch the later flight with that  _   burning in his soul: \"Are you Jesus?\"",
