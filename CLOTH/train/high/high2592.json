    "article": "When I was in the sixth grade, we moved to Tipton and my dad went to work for Arden Farms. He drove a milk truck, which   picked up   milk from the dairies  in and around Tipton. He started to work in the very early morning hours and 42 _  in the evening, after the cows had been   _  .\nSome days, he would   _   my brother and me go with him. I was always thrilled to get to ride in the old   _  . I don't   _   how many 10-gallon cans were on the truck, but I am guessing 50 or 60, and they were   _   with a big heavy cloth. I don't remember what time we went to work, but I guess it was about five in the   _  . In winter, it would still be dark and sometimes very   _   and foggy.\nWhen we arrived at the first dairy, the milkers would already have finished milking. They must have   _   at about three in the morning. These were family-owned businesses, and the whole   _   worked. I remember one   _   we made, where all the   _   would be out there working before leaving for school.\nMy dad would unload the empty cans and then load the   _   ones on the truck. He was not a really big man, but he was very   _  , so he could lift them   _   onto the truck. After he loaded all the full cans from that stop, we drove to the next dairy. In the evening, it was the same   _   all over again. He didn't   _   until about 10 p.m.\nNowadays,   _   we drive around out in these same areas, I will think of 60 _  in the milk truck with my father. I love looking for the little old buildings that were once those family-owned businesses.",
