It is something so simple, but so  _  to those who need a kind heart and a good listener. Sometimes, we all need someone to listen to us with no  _  . We just want to be heard.  _  , I really made sure that I listened to everyone who spoke to me throughout the day,  even though  I was busy. As I was  _  in the break room today, I had a conversation with a colleague I  _  talked to. She always looked like a(n)  _  lady, but today she seemed very troubled. So I sat down with my lunch and jut listened. She told me about her unlucky  _  who was killed in a car crash last year, and her  _  daughter who struggled with pain every day. I listened and made her  _  much better. At the end of the  _  , I gave the single mother a big warm hug and told her how  _  she was. Of course, we  _  friends after our first talk. What an inspiration she is!  _  with so many difficulties and frustrations, she still comes to work with a positive attitude, a  _  to succeed and a big smile every day. I believe everyone  _  a ray of sunshine in their life, someone that will give them a big warm  _  and say, \"You're amazing!\" I hope I can always get need like this met. I am a dreamer, but I move forward while I dream. My dream is to  _  happiness. Tomorrow, I will write \"You are beautiful! :)\" on small cards, hide them everywhere, and make those I work with  _  them by chance and with joy.",
