He  _  to himself, \"This driver is just as  _  as a speeder!\" So  _  he turned on his lights and pulled the driver over.  _  the car, he noticed that  _  were five old ladies -- two in the front seat and  _  three in the back, their eyes wide and faces white as ghosts. The driver, obviously  _  , said to him, \"Officer, I don't understand. I was  _  exactly the speed limit!  _  seems to be the problem?\" \"Ma'am,\" the officer replied, \"You weren't  _  , but you should know that driving  _  than the speed limit can also be a(n)  _  to other drivers.\" \"Slower than the speed limit? No, sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly...Eighteen miles per hour!\" The old woman said a bit  _  . The police officer, trying to  _  a laugh, explained to her that \"18\" was the route number,  _  the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the old woman smiled and thanked the officer for  _  out her error. \"But before I let you  _  , Ma'am, I have to ask if everyone in this car is all right? These women seem very  _  and they didn't make a single sound the whole time.\"The police officer asked. \"Oh, they will be all right  _  a minute, officer. We just  got off  Route 128.\"",
