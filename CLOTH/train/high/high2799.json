    "article": "I began to grow up that winter night. My mother said we might soon   leave for   America. We were on the bus then and I was crying. I remember I could not bear the   _   of never hearing again the radio program for school   _   to which I listened every morning.\nI don't remember myself crying   _   this reason again. In fact, I think I cried very little when I was saying   _   to my friends and relatives. I just thought about all the places I was going to see--the strange and   _   places I had known only from books and pictures. The country I was leaving never to come back was   _   in my head then.\nThe four years that followed   _   me the importance of optimism, but the   _   did not come to me at once. For the first two years in New York I was really   _   --having to study in three schools as a result of family moves. Mother remarried, and things became even more   _   for me. Some time   _   before my stepfather and I got used to each other. I was often sad, seeing no end to \"the   _   times.\"\nMy   _   in the family increased a lot since I knew English better than everyone else at home. I wrote letters,   _   out forms, translated at interviews with Immigration officers, took my grandparents to the doctor and   _   there, and even discussed telephone bills with company representatives.\nFrom my experiences I have learned one important   _  : almost all common troubles eventually   _   away! Something good is certain to happen   in the end   when you do not give up, and just wait a little! I believe that my life will turn out all right,   even though   it will not be that easy.",
