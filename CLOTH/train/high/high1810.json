    "article": "I received a letter from my father today. In the envelop folded inside the letter was a check . He  _  one to each of his five children. The letter stated that he wanted to give the   _   to us before he died. He suspects that his   _   may come soon and he wants to   _   us our \"share \" before he dies.\n   Since my mother's death, my father has shown more anger than any other   _  . He doesn't seem aware of his anger, much less   _   it. He refuses any medication, because he says \"I'm not   _   .\" I suppose this is very 43 _  in his generation. He is   _   with almost anybody and at anything.\n   He doesn't want to be   _  , so he fishes, hunts, travels and watches the \"fools\" on television. He loves talking to us, and gets some   _  from our visits. He tells me that we should stay in \"closer contact\" with one another--it   _   him that we don't, at least not like we used to. I wonder if this happens in other   _  .\n   This past Mother's Day as we visited my mother's grave, he looked to his left and looked at his name and date of birth already   carved in   the headstone they will share. I wonder  _   that must feel. He must now be feeling so much   _  . I am sure the world is a   _   place when almost all you have loved, dreamed about and hoped for begin to be lost.\n   My husband and I make a (n)   _   to take him fishing at a lake near our home this coming weekend. It is a (n)   _   activity that since my childhood my Dad and I have shared as often possible. I   _   that we have many more opportunities to do so. I will cherish  the time.",
