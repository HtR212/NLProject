    "article": "Two years ago, my husband bought me a bicycle. If you live in a town, it is often faster than a car and you don't have to   _   about parking. You can   _   it anywhere. As it has a seat at the back and a basket at the front, I can take my small daughter to school, to the library, shopping,   _   in fact.\nI use it most in summer when the weather is warm and dry. It can be very unpleasant in winter when it is cold and the rain is   _   down. It can also be very   _  . You must, of course, be careful on a bicycle. Accidents are not the only problem, though. One day I went shopping and came back to   _   my front wheel missing. It was a long   _   to bicycle shop! Now I have three strong locks.\nMy husband uses my bicycle sometimes for short journeys. He says it is better than waiting for a bus. He still uses his   _   for longer journeys, but I think that all this sitting down is making him   _   and lazy. On my bicycle I get a lot of   _   and fresh air, and this makes me feel a lot younger.",
