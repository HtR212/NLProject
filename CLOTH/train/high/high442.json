    "article": "Mr Black once decided to travel by air on business because of some reason. He liked  sitting  beside a window when he was  _  ,so when he got onto the plane, he  looked for  a window seat. He  found  that all of them had already been taken  except  one, and there was a soldier sitting in the seat beside this one. Mr Black was  _  that he had not taken the one by the window, but, anyhow, he at once went towards  _  . When he  reached  it, however, he saw that there was a notice on it. It was written  _  ink and said,\"This is reserved for proper load balance. Thank you.\" Mr Black had never seen such a notice in a plane  _  ,but he thought that the plane  _  be carrying something particularly heavy in  _  baggage room which made  _  necessary to have passengers properly balanced, so he walked on and  _  another empty seat, not beside the  _  ,to sit in. Two or three other people tried  to sit  in the window seat beside the soldier, but they, too,  _  the notice and went on. Then, when the plane was nearly full, a very beautiful girl stepped into the plane. The soldier, who was  _  the passengers coming in, quickly took the notice off the seat beside him-and  _  that way succeeded in  _  the company of the girl during the whole of the trip.",
