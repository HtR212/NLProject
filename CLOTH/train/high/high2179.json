This story may have happened a while back, but it was a   _   which has stayed with me and helped me ever since.\nIt was Thanksgiving, and I was   _   with my parents at a shelter for the needy. We were standing behind the counter   _   hot food to whoever came in. Most of our   _   looked like they had been having hard times; their clothes were worn out and dirty.   In short  , they looked needy! Then, a man came in, who looked   _   but needy. He was well-dressed, in a(n)   _   suit. I wondered what he was doing there, and my jaw   dropped in   _   when he joined the line for   _  . The closer he came to my   _   station, the more I muttered   to my self. What was this man doing? I wanted to know. Surely he wasn't going to take food   _   for those who were really in need!\nThen my mother quietly took me to one side. She said, \"You have   _   that the needs of the people who come here must be purely   _  : for food, shelter, clothing, etc. And this gentleman doesn't seem to have any of those problems.   _   what if his needs are emotional? What if he needs   _  , friends, or just to be among other human beings?\" Her words hit me like a ton of bricks! I felt I should   _   to the man -- but I didn't.\nAbout a week later the shelter received a large   _   from an anonymous  source. I couldn't help but   _   if it came from that man.\nNow,   _   I meet someone I remember my mother's lesson and try to keep an open mind, regardless of how they   _  . Needs aren't always visible. But kindness always makes a difference.",
