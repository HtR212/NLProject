In 1991, I spent five months in Niger, with sandstorms and great heat. Its  _  and beggars were my biggest and most constant complaint. Street beggars would continually reach out their hands, shouting \"Gift! Gift!\" One day, I  _  for neighboring Burking to work in a health clinic. Arriving by taxi at our destination in Burkina, we began to  _  . In darkness, a motorbike with two men approached slowly. Without any  _  , one of them grabbed my pack as the motorbike swept close by. Within seconds, the two were out of sight,  _  up by the night. The bag had my passport, money, traveler's cheques, a camera, an airline ticket and other things  _  to me. I was in deep trouble. In the weeks that followed, I  _  guarded the rest of my valuables and regarded all  _  with suspicion. All I wanted was to leave this place. Then, walking through Burkina's streets, I met with an old woman. \"Gift! Gift!\" she cried. I'd had enough. I was  _  of the country: its poverty , its thieves, the heat, and the dust. I told her angrily, \"A thief stole all my money and now I can't  _  out of your country. I cannot give you anything.\" The woman beggar listened attentively and  thought about  my words. Then she reached  _  the folds of her dress. \"Then I will give you a gift,\" she announced. Kindly, she placed an old, dark brown coin in my hand. I looked at it in  _  .

I saw then the  _  beauty of the people of Burkina, and appreciated deeply the quiet  _  of the poor. With the old woman's gift, I hope never to part with the coin she gave me. With one small coin, she  _  my concept completely.",
