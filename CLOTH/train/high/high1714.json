People did everything they could to fight the  _  ; nobody was killed from cold and  _  . Gradually ,the trapped people all went back home  _  . While fighting the snow, people  _  their animal friends until a moving story of a swallow couple appeared on the Internet. The couple hadn't eaten anything for several days  because of  the snow. They tried to fly into people's home to warm themselves, but every house was  closed  tightly . They got to a side of a balcony ( ) where wind couldn't reach. They jumped and flapped their wings to  _  the attention of the people inside the house, who were  busy with  their own things. The wife's body was  _  . She couldn't move any longer. The husband came near and  _  her with his wings. The husband lost his heat soon because of his opened wings. The next morning, the housemaster went to the balcony to  _  his flowers and saw a dead swallow outside.  _  it, he found they were two embracing together. Thinking of the  _  the snow had brought to people, he was moved to tears . He took them in for giving them some  _  they couldn't feel any longer. He found a small box,  _  it with some hay and lay the couple in . He  _  them in the garden of the community . In my hometown in the countryside, a swallow family live in the roof of my house .
