    "article": "As a customer representative for a supermarket in the US, my daily work includes hundreds of phone calls about the supermarket's pre-paid debit cards . The way the  _  speak sometimes makes me feel sick. But what makes it  _  is my mindset . Every day I wake up and promise to be a helper of my callers. I go beyond our rules in dealing with people  in need  and try to make it cheerful for them,  even though  phone calls are limited to just a few minutes.\nOne of my callers was  _  because she had made the wrong insurance payment that would  lead to  her son in college not receiving any pay outs, leaving him without any  _  for a week or two. The mother requested that the payment she had made using her card be  _  and that the funds be put back on her  _  .  I told her it would take 10 business days for the funds to be released back to the account, according to the  _  . I could clearly notice the hopelessness in her  _  when she said \"OK\" to my answer about the 10 business days.\nJust then, I  _  the hard days during my college years when I didn't get my allowance in time. I just couldn't  _  the son to undergo such a hard time, which  _  would cause his mother more stress. So, after asking my customer to  _  a moment, I went over to my manager. At my  _  , my manager agreed to put the money back on the mother's account   _  .\nUpon  _  the good news, the mother couldn't stop  _  me and calling me her angel! That call certainly made my work more  _  !",
