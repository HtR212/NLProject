On Christmas Eve when Paul came out of his office, a street boy was   walking around  the shining car. \"Is this your car, Paul?\" he asked.\nPaul  _  , \" my\nbrother gave it to me for Christmas.\" The boy was surprised. \"You mean your\nbrother gave it to you and it cost you  _  ?Paul, I wish...\" he hesitated.\nOf course Paul knew what he was going to wish he had a  _  like that. But what the boy said\nsurprised Paul greatly.\n\"I   _  ,\"\nthe boy went on, \"that I could  _  a brother like\nthat.\" Paul looked at the boy  in surprise  , then he\nsaid again, \"Would you like to take a ride in  _  car?\"\n\"Oh yes, I'd love that.\" \nAfter a short   _  , the boy turned and with his eyes shining,said, \"Paul, would you mind driving in front of my  _  ?\"\nPaul smiled a little. He knew he wanted to show his   _  that he could ride home in a  big\ncar. But Paul was  _  again. \"Will\nyou stop where those two steps are?\" the boy asked.\nHe ran up to the steps.   _  in a short while Paul heard him coming back, but he was not coming  _  . He was carrying his little crippled  brother. He sat him down on the step and   pointed to  the car.\n\"There she is, Buddy, just like I told you   _  . His brother gave it to him for\nChristmas and it didn't cost him a cent. And  some day  I'm\ngoing to give you one just like it...then you can see for yourself all the  _  things in the Christmas windows that I've been trying to\ntell you about.\"\nPaul got out and  _  the boy to the front seat of his car. The  _  older brother climbed in beside him. The three of them began an\nunforgettable holiday.",
