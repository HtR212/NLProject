    "article": "\"I failed to protect you.\" That was the message posted online by Du Yijun's boy friend. He was with the 21-year-old Fudan University student as she died in the crush of the New Year's Eve crowd on the Bund.\nDu was one of the 36 people who died that night when a holiday celebration   _   into a terrible tragedy. Authorities say overcrowding and the   _   of the police to control the crowds were the main reasons why it happened.\nFor the last three New Year's Eve celebrations, a light show on the Bund had   _   large crowds and a large police presence, but this year the light show was cancelled and there were fewer police on hand. But the crowds came   _  . About 300,000 people were on the Bund by 8:30 that evening and more kept   _  until all hell broke loose around 11:30.\nFor some unknown reason, on a stairway   _   up to the riverfront viewing platform, a sense of   _   overtook the crowd and they began to stampede .Some people   _   on the stairs and were stepped   _   to death. More lives would have been   _  had it not been for a group of brave young men who urged the crowd to   calm down  .\nCrowd   _   like the one on the Bund happen all over the world and they are becoming more   _  .According to one study, human stampedes have more than doubled in the past two decades. In recent years, hundreds of people have died at   _   festivals, football games and rock   _  -- all caught in the crush of panicked crowds.\nIn Shanghai, authorities have reacted to the Bund tragedy by cancelling or scaling back big events. But this isn't really necessary. Better planning and better crowd   _  can ensure safe celebrations.\n  _  , if you're going to a place where there will be a big crowd, you should take notice of where the exits are and, if the crowd becomes large,   _   away from the center. And most   _  , if the crowd seems too big and makes you feel uncomfortable, just leave. No celebration is   _   losing your life.",
