When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to  publish  it. The article began like this, \"Hundreds of steps lead to the high  _  surrounding the president's palace.\" The editor  _  sent the reporter a telegram directing him to find out the  _  number of steps and height of the wall.\nThe reporter set out to get these important facts at once, but it  _  him a long time to send them back. Meanwhile, the editor was growing  _  , for the magazine would soon be  _  . He sent the reporter two urgent  telegrams, but received  _  reply. He sent another, yet the reporter again  _  to reply. The editor unwillingly published the article  _  it had been written. A week later, the editor at last  heard from  the reporter, who told him in the letter that not only had he been arrested but he had been sent to  prison  . The poor man had been seized by the police while  _  the 1804 steps leading to the 15-foot wall around the palace.",
