    "article": "My 4-year-old son now enjoys posting letters. He has formed the  _  of drawing pictures, writing his name on them, and then  _  the artwork in an envelope. He then insists on  _  his handwork to the neighbors, and a mail box he  _  belongs to the elderly couple who live next door. To be  _  , I didn't think much of it, but I had  _  to warn my neighbors of the drawings  _  appearing in their letterboxes--I just didn't have the  _  to do so, because I was a little busy recently. On Tuesday of last week, I was walking down to school to collect my son when I  _  Mary, my elderly neighbor,  _  at her mail box. She said, \"Jodie, is it your little son that has been posting items in my letterbox to me?\" I was at once  _  , \"Oh yes, Mary, it is. I'm sorry. I meant to tell you...\" She cut me off, \"Jodie, I just love his mail. I've  _  every item he has sent. You don't know how much  _  the letters has made my day. I just love them.\" While I was walking down to school after our  _  , many thoughts came to me. Mary doesn't have a lot to fill her days,  _  she was a mother to a number of children herself who receives fairly regular visitors. The small  _  of getting some mail--pictures drawn by the hand of a young child--has brought  _  to her days, just as my visit to my grandparents does. I have decided that my son should  _  this practice. He should also start sending some items to his grandparents in Perth as well. It will most  _  make their day. It's doing the little, simple things that can often make a big  _  in someone's life.",
