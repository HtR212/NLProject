The horse's owner  _  that animals could think and reason as we can and that this  _  could come from training them. He trained Clever Hans to give the  _  to arithmetic   problems; the horse gave the correct answer by  _  the right number of times with its forefoot. The animal gave the correct answers not only to additions but to other arithmetic, too. It also gave the right answers when the questions were shown to it on a card.\nThis  _  was talked about so much that scientists studied the horse's  _  . The committee, after a(n)  _  study, found that Clever Hans' owner and trainer was  _  . He had not deliberately trained his horse to stop tapping by giving it a slight  _  . Members of the committee got the right answers from Hans  _  when the owner wasn't there,  _  that this type of trickery   hadn't happened.\nIt looked as if the horse really could think and  _  . But soon after this another scientist found that if the horse was asked questions to which none of the people there knew the answers, then the animal  _  gave a correct answer. The questions were asked by showing the horse a card that the questioner himself had not  _  .\nThis biologist soon discovered that the horse had actually  _  to very slight unconscious   movements of head or body made by a questioner who knew the  _  number of taps. He counted the taps to himself, and when the horse got to the right number, the questioner's tension   was  _  by a small, unconscious movement of his head or body. The horse then  _  tapping. Questioners who didn't know the answer didn't do this. The horse had really  _  itself to answer these very small  _  during its training.",
