    "article": "An American teacher walked up and down in a classroom while she was teaching stress management to her students. As she  _  a glass of water, everyone  _  they would be asked the \"half empty or half-full\" question.\n  _  , with a smile on her face, she asked, \"how  _  is this glass of water?\"\nAnswers called out  _  from eight to twenty ounces  .\nShe quieted the students down and then replied, \"The absolute weight doesn't  _  . It all depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it's not a  _  . If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my   _  . If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel  _  and paralyzed. In each case, the  _  of the glass of water doesn't change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes. Do you know why?\"\nAll the students kept silent and listened carefully, lost in thought.\nShe continued, \"Our  _  and worries in life are like that glass of water. Think about them for a while and  _  happens. Think about them a bit longer and they begin to  _  . And if you think about them all day long, you will feel paralyzed --  _  to do anything.\"\nIt's important to remember to  let go of  your stresses. As early in the evening as possible, put all your  _   down. Don't carry them through the evening and into the night. Remember to put the glass down!\nMore often than not life gets terrible   _  we think too much. And the moment you remove your burden, you'll find yourself feeling so much more  _  .\nSo rather than moping around   and feeling sorry for yourself,  _  doing something about it. After all, life is too short to  _  yourself to anything that's not making you happy.",
