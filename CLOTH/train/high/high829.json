    "article": "I went deaf in my right ear and was left with 50% hearing in my left when I was a little boy. My doctors   _   that I would be completely deaf by now, and today, my remaining hearing   _   to 20%, so I think I'm doing pretty   _  .\nFor my 18th birthday, my dad asked me to deejay at the restaurant he owned. I was   _  . I e-mailed a well-known New York City DJ: \"I know you like a challenge. How about teaching a deaf person to deejay?\" He wrote back the next day: \"Challenge   _  .\" He tutored me twice a week for two years, helping me develop proper skills. I practiced four hours a day. Now when I'm   _  , muscle memory takes over. \n  _   I started, I wouldn't tell the club managers I was deaf. I would just   show up  , introduce myself and start playing music. At the end of the night, someone would say, \"Oh, here's the check.\" And I'd say, \"What? Oh, I can't hear.\" They were always so   _  . Sometimes I would bring doctor's   _   because they wouldn't believe me. It was reassurance   that they were giving me gigs   not out of   _  , but because I was good.   _   people started calling me \"Deaf DJ\". \nMusic is not all about   _  . For each show, I can hear some of the lower frequencies and feel the 54 _  in my feet. I can feel the energy of the song and the   _   goes crazy. The next time you go dancing   _   your ears, and you'll feel a little bit of   _   I do it. You'll start using your other senses. You'll start seeing that you're able to hear the music in a   _   way. \nNow, I play all sorts of get-togethers on various occasions. I also go to schools for the deaf and talk to the students about   _   and believing in themselves. I tell their parents, \"My   _   to you is to let your kids chase their dreams. I'm a deaf DJ, so why not?\"",
