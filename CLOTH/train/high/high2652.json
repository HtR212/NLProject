I went to work feeling  _  . And to make matters worse, I was busy that evening.It' s the same thing over and over again.  _  with customers who complain about their food and where they are  _  is too big or too small.Little things like that tend to  _  a lot of us  _  but we manage to deal with it. Three elderly ladies walked in and sat by the windows.It happened to be the very  _  near where I keep the dirty  _  in the boxes.Trying to keep up with all the dirty tables, customers leaving and coming in and  _  running all over the house, it was crazy.  _  these elderly women were watching  _  I was working to make sure every table was clean and ready for the next customers. When they  _  their meals, I took their plates back to the kitchen.They talked to me for a while about school, how I was doing, what  _  I was in and what I planned to do in the future.  _  they were leaving, they walked past me and one of them said to me in a  _  and gentle voice, \"You are going places.And that was it.They left the  _  and I had tears in my eyes, because they gave me  _  to believe in myself.They  picked up  my spirit from being down and gave me a  _  to keep on working hard. People used to tell me that I could not have a career in  _  until I had a degree.I'm now a co-anchor of a student-produced television  _  And the best thing is: I'm only 17 years old and I am a senior in high school.",
