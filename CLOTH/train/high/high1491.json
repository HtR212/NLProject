I remembered him as a kind and  _  person When Dr. Gibbs didn't work, he planted trees. His house covered an area of ten acres, and his life's goal was to make it  _  . He had some interesting  _  concerning planting. He belonged to the \"No pains, no gains\"  _  of plant growing. He never watered his new trees. Once I asked  _  , he said, \"Watering plants will spoil them, and if you water them, each successive tree  _  will grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things  _  for them and weed out the weak ones.\" So he never watered his trees. He would  _  a pine, and instead of  _  it every morning, he beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. I  _  him why he did so, and he said it was to get the tree's  _  . I planted a couple of trees a few  _  ago. I carried water to them for a solid summer, sprayed them and prayed over them. Two years of careful tending has  _  in trees that expect to be  _  to hand and foot. Whenever a cold wind blows in, they tremble their branches. Dr. Gibbs passed away a  _  of years after I left home. Now and then, I walked by his house and looked at the trees. They're  _  now, big and healthy. Funny things about Dr. Gibbs' trees. Hardship and difficulty seemed to benefit them  _  comfort and ease never could. Life is tough, whether we want  _  to be or not. Too many times we pray for ease, but that's a prayer seldom met. What we need to do is to pray for  _  that reach deep into the earth, so when the rains fall and the winds blow, we won't be swept away.",
