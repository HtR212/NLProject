I was teaching fourth grade and my students had made me   _  .\nI just had to get through one of the hardest days of the school year.\n    The morning bell rang. I walked   _  through the cold into the overly\nheated school building. Twenty-two smiling faces  _  me\nat the school bus stop. I forced myself to  _  their\nsmiles. Back into the classroom, they  _  , comparing\nplans for the  _  . I had to remove one student from\neach arm  _  I could take a seat at my desk for\nmy morning duties. Before I could find my roll book  my desk was covered with  _  and gifts followed by a  _  of\n\"Merry Christmas\" wishes.\n   \"Oh, thank you,\" I must have   _  a million times. Each gift was truly special to me, except my  _  mood. It was kind of them to  think of  me.\nAfter a while, I heard a small nervous  _  say my name. I looked up to see\nBrandon standing  _  by\nmy desk, holding a small, round gift. \"This is for you.\"\n    \"Thank you, Sweetheart.\" I laid it on my desk with the others.\n   \"Um, could you  _  it now?\"\n   I gently tore at the paper and tape. \"  _  ,\" he said, \"it's breakable.\" Slowly I opened a small, green Christmas tree ornament , complete with a hook already  _  . It dawned on me what he had done.\nThen a nearby student said that he just pulled that off his own tree. I tried\nto keep my  _  back.\n    Later that day, I sat  turning over  the ornament in my hands. Was I really so important tothis child that he had searched for something to give me? Now every year as I  _   pull a green Christmas ball from my ornament box, I remember the deep influence my students have on me.",
