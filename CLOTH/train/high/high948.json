    "article": "Recently, I experienced a wonderful lesson that little things still mean a lot. I live on the Big Island of Hawaii. About a month ago, when I started my car and I  _  down at the roadside, a piece of paper caught my eye. I picked it up and  _  it carefully. The form turned out to be a  _  from the State Motor Vehicle Division, documenting the owners'  _  of their vehicle's registration fees. Quickly, I put myself in their  _  and figured:no one would throw this out,  _  if it was current. Although the form had been blown here, where in the busy,  _  parking lot would I find the owner? So I checked the date and noted the name of the  _  , who must be in our town. I thought that the best and easiest step to  _  was to put the form in an envelope addressed to the couple and  _  it by post. So I did it. On the weekend, a  _  couple called at my house and brought me a big  _  . They said they had panicked and searched for the receipt  _  everywhere before giving up. Without it they would  _  $8, 000. It felt great to know I'd helped someone  _  a major trouble by doing something which at first glance seemed minor.",
