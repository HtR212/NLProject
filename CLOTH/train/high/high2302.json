That meant   beating out   Miller King, who was the best   _   at our school.\nFootball season started in September and all summer long I worked out. I carried my football everywhere for   _  .\nJust before September, Miller was struck by a car and lost his right arm. I went to see him after he came back from   _  . He looked very   _  , but he didn't cry.\nThat season, I   _   all of Miller's records while he   _   the home games from the bench. We went 10-1 and I was named most valuable player,   _   I often had crazy dreams in which I was to blame for Miller's   _  .\nOne afternoon, I was crossing the field to go home and saw Miller   _   going over a fence--which wasn't   _   to climb if you had both arms. I'm sure I was the last person in the world he wanted to accept   _   from. But even that challenge he accepted. I   _   him move slowly over the fence. When we were finally   _   on the other side, he said to me, \"You know, I didn't tell you this during the season, but you did   _  . Thank you for filling in for   _  .\" \nHis words freed me from my bad   _  . I thought to myself, how even without an arm he was more of a leader. Damaged but not defeated, he was   _   ahead of me. I was right to have   _   him. From that day on,I grew   _   and a little more real.",
