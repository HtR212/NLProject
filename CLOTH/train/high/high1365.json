We find ourselves with less and less time to spend with our   _   and friends. I've had the same   _  myself.\nI used to have   _   times with my grandfather when we lived together. When I was very young, I often enjoyed spending time in his   _  , watching the flowers and watering the fruit trees. But as I grew up, I   _   became \"selfish\".\n   Once, when I was 6, we went shopping together. As we took the wrong bus and ended up getting   _  , unable to find our way back, I couldn't stay   _   and shouted rudely in his face. I was so stubborn that I wouldn't say sorry   _   returning home, thinking I had done nothing wrong.\nNow I   _   how ridiculous I was at the time! And I also realize how   _   it was when I finally admitted I was   _  ! When I truly wanted to express my   _  , my grandfather had left us   _  , leaving me with no more chance to   apologize for   my mistake. I couldn't   _   say to him the three words -- \"I am sorry\". \nWe are spending more and more time outside, with less and less time to   _   with our families at home. So   _   the most of every second you have with your loved ones, because time   _   going, waiting for no one.",
