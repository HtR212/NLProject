    "article": "Traveling in Vietnam was like visiting a mysterious neighbor. You have lived next door to each other for years but know very   little   about what happened on   the other   side of the fence.\nI traveled there last August. A(n)   _   180-kilometre trip from a Chinese border town to Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam,   _   an adventurous eight hours. That's   _   the country still doesn't have a modern expressway system. The major passage going through the country is only a two-way road.  _   , many areas are mountainous. \nVietnamese drivers are   _   and fearless. They compete with each other at full speeds no matter how scared the   _   feel. When the bus shook us violently for the hundredth time, the driver made a   _   to make us feel better. \"See, this is just a 50 _  Vietnamese people give you, a free massage  service.\"\nIt was midnight   _    I reached that hotel. Switching on television, I was   _   by something: All the 53 _   in the TV plays spoke in the same voice.   At present  , modern Korean plays and historical Chinese plays are   _   with the Vietnamese. But it seemed they didn't have enough   _   to dub(...) all these programs. So, the same boring woman appears   _   every TV play to speak for the roles. The next morning when I opened the window, I found myself in a huge \"58 _ \". The buildings in the streets were 59 _  in all kinds of color1s you can imagine. Vietnamese are allowed to60 _  their houses as they like. Each one was different. The large number of color1s brought the city alive.",
