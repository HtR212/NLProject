    "article": "I still remember it was in the winter of 1990 that, together with the help of my older sister, I   _   down my wishes for Christmas onto a piece of paper. How I wished on Christmas Eve my grandest wish would be   _   and placed under the Christmas tree--a puppy. When we were done, our wish-lists were collected by our parents with the promise to be   passed on   to Santa's hard-working helpers.\nThe next day, our parents sat us down in the living-room, with   _   expressions on their faces. As it   run out  , they had seen our wishes, now wanting to talk to us about one wish   in particular  -- the puppy. For a moment, I held my breath, but was   _   when they told us that they weren't against a puppy. What they   _   against was putting it under the Christmas tree. That was not a good idea.\nThey   _   taught us that an animal was not a gift that belonged to the same   _   as our toys. Animals were creatures with   _   that we should decide to have one, and it would be a (an)   _   to our family. An animal   _   a lot of responsibilities. It wasn't anything one bought out of a mood. An animal could not be exchanged or   put aside   when we didn't feel like it. A animal wasn't a toy. An animal was a   _   family member that needed lots of love and attention. An animal was not a   _  , but a family decision. A serious decision. And a big decision.\n  _  , my Parents share my love for animals, so the decision came reasonably   _  . After our grandparents had given their   _   up for taking care of the dog, while we were on future vacations, the answer was yes. Yes, we would get a puppy.\nThe following days and weeks, there was only one   _  :our new family member! Yes, a family member, because animals have their rights. They are not simply food or gifts. We humans must attend, love and protect them.",
