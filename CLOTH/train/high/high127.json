    "article": "At the beginning of the new term, I was  _  that I was going to teach math in a new class. Hearing that it was a class that several teachers had complained  about, I became anxious.  _  to know how I can  deal with  this group, I asked the former teachers about the students. One teacher told me that the students were naughty and  _  to obey the rules. One boy was especially lazy and he  _  on purpose so that he would be allowed to move back to his father's house in another state.\n  _  I met my new students, I  _  to make my class lovely and was surprised and happy to see they did better than I had thought. As I was giving them  _  problems to solve, something  _  happened. The student who tried to fail was raising his hand. I nodded. He stood up and gave the  _  correct answers. I praised him and smiled gratefully.\nLater I told the student how I was proud of his  _  and gave him a positive letter to let him take home. He said, \" I  _  you had been my teacher last term. You are the first one to  _  a positive letter home. I will try to do well in studies in the future.\" He was so excited and  _  that he was almost crying. At the end of the class he  _  me again.\nI believe that this student will  _  this term. Sometimes teachers  _  students without seeing their potential . Too often we  focus on  the negative sides rather than the positive ones. It is possible for a teacher to change students'  _  with love and encouragement. The  _  of making a difference in students is great!",
