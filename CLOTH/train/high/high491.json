    "article": "I can still remember when I met my best friend.She had just moved into the neighborhood and her grandmother brought her down to  _  me.I hid behind my mother and she hid behind her grandmother,  _  to look at each other.Soon we lost the  _  and started playing with each other. In the 7 grade,I first lost touch with her.She was  going through  family problems and I deserted her to be with the \"cooler people\" because they knew she had been a  _  person.None of my new friends liked her as much as I did because they knew she had  _  .However,every summer we could always sit at each other's house and watch soap operas,and talk about all the boys we liked. It was last year when I noticed the problem.I guess I was too devoted in high school to  _  she needed someone there for her.Anyway,she made a new best friend and so did I.Then 1 didn't know why,but she started cutting herself! She then was diagnosed with clinical depression.At first,1 was very  _  ,but we still stayed in  _  .I wanted to be there for her since her new best friend basically  _  her and people were calling her  _  ,and I knew I still cared about her like a sister. Yesterday she came to me and said:\"I never knew what a best friend was until you were the only person that would stop me cutting.I  _  you so much,and you didn't even know you were  _  me.\" We both cried.And I guess a kind of  _  from my life so far is never to give up on your friends.Even if they aren't as cool as others,or people think they are crazy,they need someone there.If you desert them,you will only be  _  yourself. So if a friend needs you, and you care for them, you can never desert them.",
