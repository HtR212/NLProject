They dreaded the awful  _  that raged across the Atlantic, wreaking havoc(,) on the buildings and crops. As the farmer  _  applicants for the job, he  _  a steady stream of refusals.  _  , a short, thin man, well past middle age, approached the farmer. \"Are you a good farmhand?\" the farmer asked him. \"Well, I can  _  when the wind blows,\" answered the  _  man. Although  _  by this answer, the farmer, desperate for  _  , hired him. The man worked well around the farm,  _  from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the man's work. Then one night the wind howled loudly in from offshore.  _  out of bed, the farmer grabbed a lantern and  _  next door to the hired hand's sleeping quarters. He  _  the little man and yelled, \"Get up! A storm is coming! Tie things down before they blow away!\" The little man  rolled over  in bed and said  _  , \"No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows.\" Enraged by the response, the farmer was tempted to  _  him on the spot. Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his  _  , he discovered that all of the haystacks had been covered with tarpaulins . The cows were in the barn, the chickens were in the coops , and the doors were barred. The shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down. Nothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his hired hand  _  , so he returned to his bed to also sleep  _  the wind blew.",
