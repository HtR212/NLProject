    "article": "When I was young, I wanted to be a teacher if I grew up,simply because I wanted to write on the chalkboard!My teachers seemed to be the  _  printers,curving their letters just so,and I wanted to do it  _  !Now,after \"higher education\",and three  _  career paths,I have come back to want to be a  _  ,but my reasons have changed. I was  _  ,to have teachers that really  cared about  me as an individual, and I want to  _  this back. A teacher's gentleness needs to be shown when  _  or encouraging the students. It is important to make the corrections in order for the students to learn.  _  ,this needs to be done in a  _  that will help to  _  the student to make the changes necessary,  _  discouraging them from learning.Being patient is also extremely important,because the class needs to know what to  _  from the teacher.This will also help to build a better agreement with the students,and help both the teacher and students to learn more about each other. If a teacher exhibits a true love of  _  and helping students learn,many of the qualities  _  above will just fall into place. The teacher that had the most  _  on me had the best fame in the school. She was strict,and she did demand a lot, but she was able to show us it was  _  she cared for us. She knew each of us was worth it,and she knew we each could do it. She  passed on  knowledge,gently, firmly, patiently,respectfully, and most effectively. She gently encouraged us to make  _  when we needed to,and  _  us when we did. She was a true teacher, not just someone who taught,and this is the kind of teacher I hope to be.",
