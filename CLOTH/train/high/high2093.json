I remember once visiting her, crying when my big sister told me \"There is no Santa Claus!\", because I knew she always told the   _  .\n\"No Santa Claus?\" she snorted . \"Ridiculous! Don't   _  it. That rumor has been going around for years. Now, put on your coat, and let's go.\"\n\"Go? Go where, Grandma?\" I asked.\n\"Where\"  _  to be Kerby's General Store. As we walked in, Grandma   _  me twenty dollars. \"Take the money,\" she said, \"and buy something for someone who needs it. I'll wait for you outdoors.\"\nI was only eight years old, and had never shopped for anything  _  . For a few moments I just stood there,  46 _ , wondering what to buy, and   _  on earth to buy it for.\nI thought of everybody I knew: my family, friends, classmates. Suddenly I thought of Bobbie, a kid sitting behind me in the classroom. He didn't have a   _  ; he never went out during the winter. I held the bill  _  . I would buy Bobbie a coat. I saw a red one with a hat to it. It looked really  _  . He would like that.\nThat  _  , Grandma helped me wrap the coat in Christmas paper and write, \"To Bobbie, From  Santa Claus  \"on it. Then she drove me to Bobbie's house. Grandma  _  down the street, and we hid in the bushes by his front walk. Then Grandma pushed me gently. \"All right, Santa Claus, get going!\" she  _  .\nI took a deep breath,  _  for his front door, threw the   _  down, rang his doorbell and flew back. Together we waited  _  in the darkness for the front door to open. Finally it did, and there stood Bobbie.\nForty years haven't  _  the thrill of those moments. That night, I realized those awful   _  about Santa Claus were just what Grandma said: they were  _  . Sana was alive and well, and we were on his team.",
