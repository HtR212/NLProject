I think it is those people who are eager for  _  with an unquenchable thirst who,  in the end  , are likely to be most satisfied with their lives. Author Napoleon Hill said, \"  _  is the starting point of all achievement, not a hope, not a wish,  _  a strong desire which transcends everything.\" He is really  talking about  a deep thirst. Alan C. Elliott tells in his book A Daily Does of the American Dream about a five-year study that was undertaken to  _  what made some people extraordinarily successful. The study consisted of detailed research into the  _  of 120 of the nation's top artists, athletes, and scholars. He reports that the researcher was  _  to find that natural abilities played only a small part in the  _  of those individuals. But research found that they  _  a powerful thirst to succeed. They practiced the piano four hours every day,  _  well before school in the morning to practice swimming or running, or spent much time  _  (time they could have spent hanging out with friends) working on science projects or painting. Parental support was also a key factor.  _  of these extraordinarily thirsty young people helped out,  _  their children to great ideas and influential persons. Many sacrificed to ensure that their children received  _  training. But in the end, it was their children's  _  that made the difference. The principle  applies to  adults, too. If you want to be more successful, the question you might first ask yourself is, \"How thirsty am I?\" Your  _  in any field you choose, anything you want to be or anything you want to do will  depend on  your answer to that simple question.",
