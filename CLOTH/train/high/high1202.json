    "article": "Some plays are so successful that they run for years on end. In many ways, this is   _   for the poor actors who are required to go on repeating the same   _   night after night. One would   _   them to know their parts by heart and   _   have cause to falter  . Yet   this   is not always the case.\nA famous actor in a   _   successful play was once cast in the role of an aristocrat   _   had been imprisoned in Bastille for twenty years. In the last act, a gaoler (,) would always come on to the stage with a letter which he would hand to the prisoner.   Even though   the noble was expected to read the letter at each   _  , he always insisted that it should be written out in full.\nOne night, the gaoler decided to play a joke   _   his colleague to find out if, after so many performances, he had managed to learn the   _   of the letter by heart. The curtain went up on the final act of the play and revealed   the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell. Just then, the gaoler   appeared   with the precious letter in his hands. He entered the   _   and presented the letter to the aristocrat. But the copy he gave him had not been written out in   _   as usual. It was simply a blank sheet of paper. The gaoler looked on eagerly,   _   to see if his fellow actor had at last learn t his lines. The noble stared at the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds. Then, squinting   his eyes, he said, \"The light is   _  . Read the letter to me.\" And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the gaoler.   Finding   that he could not remember a word of the letter either, the gaoler replied, \"The light is indeed dim, sir. I must get my   _  .\" With this, he hurried off the stage. Much to the aristocrat's   _  , the gaoler returned a few moments later with a pair of glasses and the   _   copy of the letter which he proceeded   to read to the prisoner.",
