He remembers details that an adult may have difficulty in remembering.Gradually , he learns elementary skills in problem-solving.At school, particular in  _  classes, the child is especially creative.Given a piece of paper and some colored pencils, he draws a variety of  _  from his surroundings as well as from his  _  circle.It is not surprising to see a child draw a monster to represent an abusive father, and an angel to represent a loving and caring mother. As he graduates to the later stages of childhood bordering on the teenage years, the child learns the  _  of human relations and socialization by interacting with his peers--his friends and schoolmates. He also learns to  _  with new life situations, including dates and part-time work.
