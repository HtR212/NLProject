    "article": "Discussing the causes of animal endangerment, it's important to understand individual species are not the only factors. Endangerment is a broad   _  , one that involves the habitats  and environments. Although some measures are being taken to help specific cases of endangerment, the universal problem cannot be solved until humans   _  the natural environments.\nThere are many reasons why a particular species may become endangered, but\nhabitat destruction is on top.\nOur planet is changing, causing habitats to be modified. Natural changes tend to occur at a   _  pace, usually causing only a slight  _  on\nindividual species. However, when changes occur at a fast pace, there is little\nor no time for individual species to  _  and\nadjust to new circumstances, which can create terrible results. For this\nreason, rapid habitat loss is the primary cause of species endangerment. The\nstrongest  _      in rapid habitat loss are human beings. Nearly every region of the earth has been affected by human activity. The loss of microbes   in soils that   _  supported tropical forests, the  _  of f various fishes in polluted habitats, and changes in global climate caused\nby the  _  of greenhouse gases are all results of\nhuman activity.\nIt can be difficult for an individual to   _  the\neffects humans have had on specific species. But it is quite  _  that human activity has greatly  _  to species endangerment.  For example  ,\nalthough tropical forests may look as if they were thick and healthy, they are  _  highly susceptible  to destruction because the soils in which they grow    _  nutrients. If the current rate of forest loss continues, huge\nquantities of plant and animal species will disappear.",
