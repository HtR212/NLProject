Not much we can do,\"she said .\"Try not to think about it when you go to sleep tonight.\"\nI walked  _  the mailbox the next day.The baby bird lay  _  in the grass.\nI realize that \"Try not to think about it\" is the  _  of many people towards things which  _  to provide them with perfect excuses  _  not bothering . The woman wasn't being  _  ; she was actually quite nice. But when everyone says\"there's  _  I can do --just try not to think about it,\"Where will we finally  end up  ? When billions of people  _  try not to think about it When they go to bed at night, there might be millions of fallen birds lying dead and  _  in the grass the next morning.",
