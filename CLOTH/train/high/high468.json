    "article": "That morning, I got the train as always. I was a publishing director and was looking forward to embracing a new day of work, as usual. I would always turn to the crossword , but that day it didn't  make any sense  . I'd been doing it for 30-old years, but trying to read this one was like walking through syrup :  _  slow and hard. I thought I must be tired. I said to my assistant. The  _  colleague contacted my wife, Beth, and she drove me straight to hospital. There, confirmation came that I'd had a stroke in the part of my brain that  deals with  communication. I was now in a condition that means it's difficult or  _  to receive and produce language. It was the only time I  _  . I was back at home a week later, and my goal was to get better and  return to  work in a couple of months. The way to  _  my language ability was rough. I'd look at simple pictures and try to describe them as my mind  _  round and round in the darkness, looking for words. As the months passed, it became  _  that I wasn't going to be able to go back to my old job. For 25 years, I had  _  myself as a publisher. I was used to a busy day of meetings. I enjoyed colleagues and the  _  I'd had. I didn't feel ready to say goodbye to my old self. There were times when I felt incredibly  _  . In the darkest months, I devoted myself to  _  . I couldn't manage novels or newspapers,  _  I tried reading poetry, and found the shorter lines less overwhelming . My speech came back, and I learned how to read again, though much more slowly. I also learned the  _  to keep up. I allowed myself to slow down, and started to enjoy it.  _  , I get rid of my old skin. I grieved the past, its passing and its absence, and started to  come to terms with  it. Now, 10 years later, I look after my grandson a day a week, and my relationship with my family is deeper than ever. If you'd asked me 15 years ago to  _  the importance of the things in my life I might have said work, but now I'm no longer a high-achieving publisher or someone who reads 10 books a week. I'm a  _  man, and if I read 10 books a year, that's pretty good.",
