Only after five minutes do you   _   me to say, \"Sorry I' m late.\" At ten minutes I owe you an   _  : \"The freeway exit was closed. I had to go four miles out of my way.\" After twenty minutes I have to make a full and serious   _  . After forty minutes I'd better not   show up   at all. \nThat sort of thing -- so formally   _   and never explicitly stated-- drives people from other cultures   _  . Anthropologists  list the   _   things to cope with in a foreign land. Second only to the language barrier is the way we deal with   _   .\nNow psychologists look at our   _   of time another way. They go into several countries and measure the   _   of life. They measure the accuracy of bank clocks and how fast city residents walk. They time transactions  in banks and post offices. They see   how long   people take to answer questions.\nJapanese keep a   record   of the fastest pace. Americans are a   _   second. Italians and Indonesians are at the bottom of the   _  . Italians give long answers to your questions. Indonesians don't   care about   setting their bank clocks .\n  Among   American cities, Boston and Kansas City are fastest. New York is up there, of course, but we keep a faster pace here in Houston. California's \"slow -pace \"reputation is   _  , as the slowest pace of all is kept in Los Angeles.\nIn a technology-dense world, the tension of life has changed our view of time.   _  , if we are smart enough , we should not live by the clock only when we have to .\nNow it's 4:55. I'm walking   _  , towards our 4:30 meeting.",
