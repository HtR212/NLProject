    "article": "Blogs allow readers to post comments. There were millions of blogs out there, so I  _  expected anyone to read mine,  let alone  respond. But almost immediately they did. Twelve messages were  _  after my first entry. I went to the library five times that day--each time there were more. The next morning I couldn't wait to get up and hurry to the library.  All day long  I told my story. It gave structure and a purpose to my day. For so long I'd been unable to  reach out  in the real world, afraid of rejection or pity or scorn .  _  here it was safe. This  _  with people on the other side of the screen, many on the other side of the world, was  _  me back to life again. One particularly cold Tuesday I opened my  _  to see, among emails from bloggers  concerned about  how I was surviving the snow, one saying: \"New York Times Journalist Trying to Contact You.\" Ian Urbina had discovered my blog  by chance  when researching an article on people living in their  _  in the U.S. exchanged emails and later he called me up. I hadn't spoken to  _  for months but, as rain streamed down the glass  _  , the words came. I had been living in the car for almost nine months. The article  _  on the front page. I didn't know until I opened my computer. There were emails from people around the world. For almost a year on one had known I  _  existed but now here were hundreds wishing me well. They said they were  _  for me. Now every time I pressed \"Check Mail\", there were more messages. I watched the numbers of the visitors counter on my blog  _  by the hundreds. These were people at their computers all over the world. I felt as of I was viewing a miracle unfold . Over the next week, in libraries and in the car  _  under lamp posts at night, I wrote my papers. I had notepaper spread  _  the dashboard . And every morning in the quiet of the lane, I wrote for my life.",
