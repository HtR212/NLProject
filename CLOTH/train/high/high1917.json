    "article": "It is hard to decide which food to buy in an American grocery store these days.The information on many products makes41 _  claims.The label \" organic( )\"  _  that the United States Department of Agriculture recognizes the product is grown under special conditions.If the food is grown    in this way   , it shows the words \"USDA organic\" on it.This is an official label.\nThe food is grown without chemical treatment against insects or  _  .  It is grown without chemical fertilizers.Before a product is labeled \" organic ,\"a(n)45 _  visits the farm where the food is produced to make sure the farm   _  SDA standards.Organic meat , eggs and dairy products come from  _  that are given no antibiotics  , must be fed organic food and have   _   to the outdoors.\nNo conclusive   _   shows that organic food is more nutritious than traditionally grown food. And the USDA --even if it proves organic food --doesn't   _   declare that these products are safer or more nutritious. Organic foods meet the same   _   and safety standards as traditional foods. The difference   lies in  how the food is produced , processed and handled.Some people buy organic food for   _   reasons. Organic food is produced by   _    who emphasize the use of renewable resources. The prices between most organic food and   _   good products vary. Higher prices are due to more expensive farm   _  . A lot of work must be done every day.\nThe new USDA' s national organic programme for labeling is   _   to enabling consumers to make a(n)  _    choice among the foods they buy and have the   _   of the safeguard of being cheated.People who sell or label a product \" organic\" when they know it does not meet USDA standards can be   _    up to $11 ,000.",
