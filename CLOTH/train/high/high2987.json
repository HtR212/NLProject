    "article": "All of my students I taught at Saint Mary's School in Morris, Minnesota were dear to me, but Mark was one in a million. His happytobealive attitude made even his occasional naughtiness     _   .\nMark talked  32 _   in class. I had to remind him again and again that talking without     _    was unacceptable. What impressed me so much, though, was his sincere response every time I had to correct him for misbehaving, \"Thank you for correcting me, Madam!\" I didn't know what to make of it at first, but before long I became     accustomed to    hearing it many times a day.\nHowever, one morning my patience was  35 running out   when Mark talked once too often. I warned Mark, \"If you say one more word, I am going to tape your mouth  36 _   !\"\nIt wasn't ten seconds later when Chuck blurted out , \"Mark is talking again.\" I hadn't asked any of the students to help me  37 _   Mark, but since I had stated the  38 _   in front of the class, I had to act on it.\nTaking out a roll of masking tape from the drawer of my desk, I walked to Mark's desk,     tore off     two pieces of tape and made a big X with them over his mouth. I then returned to the  40 front    of the room.\nAs I glanced at Mark to see how he was doing, he winked at me naughtily. That he did so funnily! I started  41 _   . The entire class  42 _    as I walked back to Mark's desk,  43 _   the tape, and shrugged my shoulders. His first words were, \"Thank you for  44 _   me, Madam!\"\nSeveral years passed until one cold rainy day when my father broke the news to me that Mark was killed in Vietnam War, I broke down and cried in my heart, \"Mark, I would give all the masking tape in the world  45 if only   you could talk to me!\"",
