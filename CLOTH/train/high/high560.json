    "article": "Yesterday I was shopping with my 5-year old daughter  _  a group of punk rockers walked by with orange spiked hair and tattoos  _  much of their bodies . At the sight of them , my daughter immediately asked me , \" Daddy , why are they  dressed up  like that ? \" Years ago I would have felt very  _  with such young people . I would have given a judgmental explanation and passed along to her my  _  . However , that day I said to my daughter , \" I'm not really sure , but it's interesting how  _  we all are , isn't it ? \" She said , \" Yeah ,  _  I like my own hair . \"\nActually , I was pretending to be an anthropologist . Anthropology is a science which deals with man and his social habits . I think of anthropology here as \" being interested , without  _  , in the way other people choose to live and  _  . \" - When you are curious about the way someone behaves or the way they feel about something , it's  _  that you will be annoyed .\nWhen someone acts in a way that seems  _  to you , rather than react in your usual way , such as \" I can't believe they would do that , \"  _  say something to yourself like \" I see , that must be the way they  _  things in their world . Very interesting . \" In order for this  _  to help you , you have to be genuine as I tried that day . I  _  my perspective from the bottom of my heart . And that made me  _  .\nWhen you are interested in other perspectives , it doesn't mean you're  _  them . I certainly wouldn't choose a punk rock lifestyle or  _  it to anyone else . At the same time , however , it's really not my  _  to judge it either . One of the most important rules of joyful living is that judging others takes a great deal of energy and  _  you away from where you want to be .",
