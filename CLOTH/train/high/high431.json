    "article": "Once upon a time, there was a golden songbird that lived in a beautiful garden. It spent all its days singing the loveliest songs to   _   all the people who heard it. But the   _   of the garden desired to have the little songster, and one day he made a cunning net in which he   _   it. The little bird begged the gardener to set it free. It   _   to tell him three great secrets if only he would let it go. Now that the gardener really was a very greedy man, he   _  set the bird free.\nThen the songbird told him its three   _  : never believe all that you   _  , never regret what you have never lost and   _   throw away which you have in your keeping. The gardener was very   _   when he heard this. He said he had already known these so-called \"secrets\". And he shouted that the bird had   _   him. But the songbird quietly replied that   _  the gardener had really known these secrets, or only the   _   of them, he would never have let it go.\nThen the bird added, \"I have a most   _   jewel weighing over three ounces  hidden inside me. Whoever   _   that jewel will have every wish granted.\"  _    hearing this, the gardener cursed himself for   _   the songbird. But the bird explained that since it weighed no more than half an ounce at most, it was   _   that so big a jewel could be hidden within its tiny body.\nThe gardener lunged at the bird in   _   anger, but it flew to a nearby branch and said   _  , \"You never had the 60 _  in your hands, but you are already regretting what you never lost and believing what I told you. You threw it away by setting me free.\"",
