She budgets carefully and   _    to plan for the little luxuries   and treats that others take for granted. When her eldest son, David, wanted a   _    so that he could do an after-school newspaper delivery job, she   saved up    and soon, he was the proud   _    of a good second-hand bike.\n    One afternoon, my daughter asked David to go to a local shop. He rode his bicycle,   _   foolishly left it outside the shop without   _    it up. When David came out of the shop, it was  _  . He walked home in   _   and then, together with his frustrated mother, went to the local police station to report the   _  .\n    Imagine their   _    when they arrived at the station: a car parked out front had David's bike wedged   in its boot  . The   _   told them how he'd seen a group of kids   _   the bike once my grandson had gone inside the shop.\n    The driver - in his late teens himself - had called out to them to \"leave that bike   _  !\" Despite this, one member of the group   _   on the bicycle and rode it away while the others followed. Not to be   _  , the teen got in his car, drove after them and   _   that they give the stolen bike back.\n    He was happy to be able to   _   it to my grandson together with a lecture (echoed by the policeman and his mother) about the silliness of   _   to use the bike lock.   _  , in all the excitement, he slipped away, without even giving them his name or telephone number.",
