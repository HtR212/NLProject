Most of my relatives and friends lived there, so there was never a  _  of aunts to spoil me or children to play with me. My father is a journalist,  _  there wasn't much work for him in Belgium at that time. When I was eight, he  _  he'd found a good job in London and that we were going to move there.

The excitement soon  _  after we moved there.  _  our arrival in London, I had to start a new school and learn a new  _  . I didn't know things in fashion, either. For the  _  six months I had extra lessons to learn English. This  _  with cards and progressed towards books. I'm a  _  learner ,so I soon caught up. It was fitting in with other  _  in my school that took a bit more work. For the first two years or so I was an outsider, no matter how much I tried to  fit in  .

Thankfully, some of my classmates began to  _  me, and they became a great help as they helped me to  leave out  the things that made me a \"foreigner\". By the time I  _  primary school, most people couldn't believe I had moved to England only four years before. I was  _  able to fit in, grasp the language and adapt to the culture. Trying to fit in is my  _  to anyone who has just moved from the homeland. or is planning to. \"Fitting in\" doesn't mean completely  _  yourself to be someone else ,but it does mean trying to learn the  _  culture and language, ,which will make your life easier.",
