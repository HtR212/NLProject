Then I would  _  teach them whatever new things I had just  _  at school.\nFor me, dream was one thing, and  _  was quite another. My family was too poor to  _  my tuition. Finally, with others'help, I attended a state university. However, I  _  needed more money to pay for my other expenses, so I found a part-time job,  _  test tubes in the science department. At then I believed that every dirty test tube I washed meant I was one step closer to my  _  .\nWhen working as a substitute   teacher in the local area, I learned they were planning to  _  the biology teacher I had substituted for. I was sure the  _  was meant for me. However, the principal   said, \"You're too  _  . This last teacher had a lot of discipline problems because of his age. We want someone older - with more  _  .\"\nI cried all the way to work, disappointed and  _  . Suddenly, a stranger who I met by chance asked me what had happened.
