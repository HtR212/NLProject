    "article": "Mrs. White lost her dog. After searching place after place, she placed a \"Lost Dog\" advertisement in the local newspaper. The following morning her phone rang and a  _  voice began, \"I'm calling about your  _  .\" Then the caller coughed and cleared her voice a few times. She  _  that she wasn't feeling well and that, in fact, she hadn't felt well  _  her husband died three years ago. She went on to tell that her parents had passed away, and her sister was  _  with a deadly illness. Even her friends were not doing well. After 30 minutes of  _  , sympathizing and even trying offers of help, the dog owner  _  the conversation back to the  _  subject. \"About the dog,\" she said. \"Oh,\" the caller  _  , \"I don' t have him. I just thought I'd call to  _  you up.\" Maybe her technique needed improving, but her  _  were right on. And though \"cheering up\" may not be exactly what we  _  , we certainly need encouragement ---  pulling up  --- at times. The need for sincere  _  is basic among human beings. Do you need encouragement? There're those who will support your side. Educator Booker T. Washington observed, \"There're two ways of  _  one's strength: one is pushing down;  the other  is pulling up.\" There're people ready to pull you up when others are pushing down. We need those people in our lives - those who use their strength by pulling us up. I believe these people can be found  _  . I believe that we can all become \"  _  \", lifting one another from dark pits of discouragement to the light of  _  . And when that happens, the world will never be  the same  .",
