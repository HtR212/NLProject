    "article": "(2012)I was shopping at a department store and had just boarded the down escalator  when I noticed a woman standing at the side. She looked about 65 years old,and her expression told me she was   _  .I turned toward her and asked,\"Do you need help?\"\nAs the escalator continued moving I heard the woman reply   _  ,\"I'm afraid. \"There was a hint  of disbelief in her   _  .\"Do you want me to come   _   and get you?\"I called to her. She   _  .But by the time I   _   her,the woman reconsidered,\"Sorry,I don't think I can even put my feet on it.\" I was suddenly   _   that I took a more difficult task than I had expected. \"I know we can do it,\"I comforted her,\"I can   hold on to   you.\" She looked down at the beast. Then her eyes came back to mine,looking   _  .\"This has never   happened to   me before,\"she said,as much to herself as to me. I felt that her sudden   _   had something to do with the escalator's inhuman mechanical coldness.\nI took her arm. She made a little sound of   _   as we stepped on,but she   _   slightly as the stairs moved us   _  .\"I don't  understand this at all,\" she said. As we neared the bottom,her   _   was tight on my arm again,but we did fine. \"I'm so  _  ...\" she said,\"It was nothing,\" I said,\"I was happy to do it.\"\nYes,I was very happy at that moment. I am busy   caring for   a family and working full time. I do   little   to help others. For a brief moment,I had a flash of understanding into why someone would become a nurse or a social worker. When I   _   the woman,I felt pure,whole and purposeful. It was a   happier   moment than I'd had in weeks.",
