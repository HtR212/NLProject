    "article": "I have two friends who love backpacking. They spent a lot of time in a part of New York State's Adirondack Mountains. It  consists of  46 mountains with a height of over 4,000 feet. The Adirondack Mountain Club gives  _  recognition, and an award, to anyone who  _  all 46 mountains. My two friends decided to go for this award.\nNow what you have to understand is that  _  many of the 46 mountains have well-marked  _  to their summits  , others are not marked at all. You have to \"bushwhack  \" using a compass and a map.\nMy friends had climbed 45 of the mountains. They had just one  _  -- it was the most  _  requiring bushwhacking. A hiking path led past the base of the mountain, but from that point they were on their own.\nEarly one morning they left their  _  and walked five miles on the hiking path to the base of a chain of mountains. When they arrived, they  _  that they had left their compass and map back in camp. Rather than  returning to  the camp, they decided to bushwhack without the compass and map.\nFor hours they  _  uphill enduring heat, thick bush, and black flies.  _  , late in the afternoon they found themselves at the  _  of a mountain successfully. They were exhausted but  _  .\nThe feeling was short-lived, however. When they looked across the valley, they  _  another higher mountain. They had climbed the  _  one! It was too  _  that weekend to put their error right. They had to  _  another four months to climb the right mountain.\nThis story  _  us a good lesson. Often in life we put in a great effort to reach a goal. But without the right \"map\" and \"compass\", it is  _  to get \"lost\".",
