    "article": "I decided not to bring in home any other things with the words Made in China on a dark Monday, two days after last Christmas, though I still keep some in my house. At work my boss, Mr. White, points out that I am  _  myself if I think I have been  _  Chinese products, in spite of the obvious facts in daily life. \"Chinese  _  are everywhere,\" he says, \"You can't avoid those, no matter how hard you try, it is impossible.\" That is the  _  , which I have been considering for months, since I have kept the American car with the Chinese  _  in it. This week I was  _  again of the difficulty of avoiding China when I bought earrings from a local artist. I was feeling pleased with myself  _  I got home and noticed the gift box made in China. My boss continues, \"You know what you are doing? You are  _  your dependence on China, not  _  it,\" he says, \"You are just cheating yourself.\" The boss, a frequent complainer, doesn't slow down when I  _  to stop him to  _  that I am writing a  _  of stories on the boycott for the business magazine. \"Maybe you can  _  it a year without Chinese products,  _  sooner or later you will even  _  Chinese dishes,\" the nice boss says, \"There is no getting around it.\" I  _  at him as he turns to leave, quite  _  . \"Thanks for your support,\" I say to his  _  . The year is nearly half over. I can  _  without them.  _  , it is a little inconvenient to live without a DVD player, a DV camera or a printer made in China. But a better question might be: How hard could it be to live without Made in China with the whole family?",
