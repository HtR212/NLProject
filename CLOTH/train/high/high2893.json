    "article": "Maybe you know the saying, \"When you point one finger, there are three fingers pointing back to you.\" One wise man had a version of this  _  when he said, \"Don't focus on the dust in your brother's eye while  _  the dirt in your own eye.\" Why do we do this? Because criticisms are always  centered on  ourselves. When we criticize others, we do not expose them, but expose ourselves. We  _  our own weakness and smallness. A story in the old tales  _  the difference in wisdom between the good and the bad. Once a king  meets with  both Nelson and Dick. The king asks Nelson to go out into the kingdom and  _  after finding someone less qualified than himself. Then he asks Dick to go out into the kingdom and return after finding someone  _  than himself. When Fool Dick returns, he tells the king that he couldn't find anyone better than himself.  _  Wise Nelson says that he was  _  to find anyone less qualified than himself on his return. Moral of the story is something about human  _  . Good people always look at their own  _  and faults and consider themselves less qualified than others. Whereas bad people always look at the shortcomings and faults of others and  _  themselves more qualified than others.",
