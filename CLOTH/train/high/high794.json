    "article": "There is a small shop about 200 meters from where I live that sells groceries, meat and other basic necessities. About 10 years ago, there was a beggar who would go into the shop every day and ask the owner for a  _  . The owner,  _  he would love to help, simply didn't have any jobs available, so he kept  _  the man's request. This situation continued  _  for a few months, until the owner  _  to give the homeless man a job which  _  sweeping outside the shop. Every single day from 5 am, the homeless man was there doing the very  _  he could for the  _  , even though it did earn him some pennies.  _  , the owner saw how good a job the man was doing and gave him a job working  _  a cashier. He was watched closely to make sure that he didn't  _  any of the money received from the sales. He was still homeless, after all. The homeless man did a/an  _  job as a cashier for over 2 years, and did such a good job that he was promoted to  _  the finances for the whole shop. To my  _  , this was the arrangement up until 2 years ago, when the owner  passed away  . In his will, he only had one  _  , to give the whole shop to the now stable, \"homeless\" man. Now, I could walk into that shop and see him working as hard as  _  , with his own business that is still  _  and active 10 years after getting his job as a sweeper. From this story, we can probably get the inspiration: work hard and give everything your best effort, even if it isn't your  _  situation, it very well may turn out to  _  some day in the future.",
