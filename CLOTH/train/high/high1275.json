Jazzy was taken from her  _  owners, who were immediately  _  with animal cruelty. Why? Because neighbors had  _  seeing little Jazzyy moving around her back yard with two broken front legs. Her owners, who were supposed to  care for  her most, did absolutely nothing about it. They had never sought any kind of  _  for poor Jazzy.

In a Los Angeles animal shelter, things got even  _  . The shelter could not provide the costly operations that could be  _  to restore Jazzy's ability to  _  and lead a normal life, and it was impossible to find a family who would be able to  _  a dog in this condition.
