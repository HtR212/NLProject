Once there was a boy who constantly sat and talked in his math class, and seemed  _  in group activities. Most teachers would  _  think of him as a problem student. However, Anna was different. She believed the student was above  _  in other areas so she created a strategy to find out. Anna didn't  _  the parents. Instead she organized a handful of activities in the class to get more information. In place of calling out for volunteers in class she created a  _  for each Friday: Girls vs Boys. The first week the class was totally  _  . Everyone wanted to win. Even the boy had his hand up the whole time trying to get a turn.  _  , Anna waited, and waited, and waited. Finally the  _  teacher paired the boy with the most  _  girl student in class. Now the two teams had a  _  score, all the students sat back eager to see the result. As the teacher placed the question on the board, most of the students began to  _  their heads: this was a question they had never  _  in class. \"  _  !\" the teacher yelled. Both students started doing it  _  thinking of how to solve the complex question. Their classmates, full of  _  , exclaimed, \"Hurry, hurry, hurry!\" The boy finished it just seconds before the girl and spun around with his  _  raised, \"I won!\" Almost nobody could believe the student they admired failed until Anna  _  the result. This was what Anna tried to get it turned out that the student wasn't bad, he was  _  . So we can see that  _  hidden abilities is not always easy but the end results can be magical. Try your hand at this quality of leadership now and report your results.",
