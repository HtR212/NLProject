    "article": "It has been difficult to sit on the bench the majority of my high school basketball career,to watch my team from the sideline and  _  why I am not good enough to be on the floor.  _  endless hours of work and devotion, pushing myself through drill after drill, the  _  thing I want is to be a cheerleader. The feeling of being  _  is sometimes too much and drives me to  _  on the spot. I often feel as though my efforts are wasted and my time is eaten away, devoted to  _  . It is heartbreaking to be a spectator for the game I love,knowing that no one has enough  _  to give me the chance to  _  on the floor. Tears well up, but I hold them back. I shouldn't be so  _  over something so silly. Away from the game, it's easier to put my thoughts together,  rather than  letting my emotions drive my reasoning. I consider  _  I am where I am. I have played football my whole life. I have a passion for the  _  and always have. There is nothing like the excitement of  _  : the swish of the net, the sweat rolling off my cheeks, even the bruises are battle wounds worn  _  after every game. Even if I don't play much, I participate in every  _  . I am part of a team of girls who  _  together like a family. I am there for them,  _  they are for me. Should I move on? Or should I stay with my team and pursue my passion just a little longer? The decision isn't difficult when I consider the  _  that being a part of a team brings me --- and not just any team,  _  my team. I love basketball and my teammates. When I think about that, my view from the bench really isn't so bad  after all  .",
