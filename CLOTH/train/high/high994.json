    "article": "I remembered the evening news I watched last night. The news was about a prize for scientific  _  ; I forgot what\nit was. The announcer, whose name was Ralph Sorry, said something that caught\nmy  _  .  \"All great discoveries,\" he said,\n\"are made by people between the ages of twenty five and thirty.\"  _  a little over thirty myself, I wanted to disagree with him.  _  wants to think that he is past the age of making any discovery. The\nnext day I happened to be in the public library and spent several hours looking\nup the  _  of famous people and their\ndiscoveries. Ralph was right. First I looked at some of the  _  discoveries. One of the earliest discoveries, the famous experiment\nthat proved that bodies of different  _  fall at the same\nspeed, was made by Galileo when he was 26. Madam Curie started her research\nthat  _  to the Nobel Prize when she was 28. Einstein\nwas 26 when he published his world changing theory Theory of Relativity. Well,  _  of that. Yet I  _  if those \"best\nyears\" were true in other  _  .\nThen how about the field of   _  ? Surely\nit needs the wisdom of age to make a good leader. Perhaps it  _  ,but look when these people  _  their career.\nWinston Churchill was elected to the House of Commons at the age of 26. Abraham\nLincoln  gave up  the life of a country lawyer and elected to\nthe government at what age? Twenty-six.\nBut why   _  best years come after\nthirty? After thirty, I  _  , most people do not want\nto take risks or try  _  ways. Then I thought of people like\nShakespeare and Picasso. The former was writing wonderful works at the ripe age\nof fifty, while the latter was  _  trying new\nways of painting when he was ninety! Perhaps there is still  _  for me.",
