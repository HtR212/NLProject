We decided to let it continue growing until we could  figure out   what it was. \nThe mysterious plant appeared to be a sunflower, so I decided to take care of it. One day, as I pulled rocks from the area to get to the weeds, I noticed something  _  . The sunflowers had not   _   where I saw the stalk begin. It  _   had begun under a big rock and grown under and around it to reach the  _  .\nThat's when I   _  that if a tiny little sunflower didn't let a big rock stand in its  _  of developing, we too have the capability of doing the same thing. Once our environment begins to see that we believe in ourselves like that little sunflower, we can  _  the same nutrient  as well. We need to believe in ourselves knowing we have the capabilities in  _  our desires. Like the sunflower, it knew it had the capability to overcome its obstacle because it   _  in\nthe universal truth and had  _   that it would succeed.\nStand tall like the sunflower and be  _  of who and what you are and the  _  will begin to support you. You will find a way to go under or  _  your big obstacle in order to reach your desires.",
