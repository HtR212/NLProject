    "article": "In my hometown there lived a sixty-year-old man. He was very  _  and never got ill. He liked eating poisonous  _  since he was a boy. Nearly every week, he climbed up a   _  nearby to catch snakes. He did not know how many times he had been  _  by snakes. He usually took some medicine with him  in case  he would be bitten by a snake. Once he  used up  his medicine and didn't take any, but there was nothing  _  with him. Few people believed that until an interesting story took place.\nOne day last spring, when the old man was having a walk in the street, a wild dog   ran at  him and hurt him by the left leg. The old man was so   _   that he picked up a big stone and ran after the dog. But before the old man  caught up with  it, the dog lay down and  _  after running 100-meter-long. Being paid no attention to, the old man took the dead dog home and  _  it. A neighbor  _  to visit him and had a piece of meat, too. But soon after the neighbor ate the meat, he had a stomachache and had  _  breathing. Then the neighbor was sent to a  _  nearby.\nThe doctor was a man with  _  experience and he knew the old man very well who liked eating poisonous snakes.  _  asking several questions and giving a general examination, the doctor let the old man's neighbor  _  some medicine for snake poison. Fortunately, the patient got  _  half an hour later.\nIt was said that the snake  _  in the strange old man's body was much more poisonous than in a big poisonous snake. So this story had happened.",
