    "article": "When I returned from a trip abroad, I felt that something was wrong between Keith (one of our twin sons) and me. So I asked him, \"Keith, have I done anything that really  _  your feelings?\"\nInstantly, he said, \"Yes. Last Christmas you promised me a special  _  that I really wanted and you  _  gave it to me.\"\nThe  _  is that I'd completely forgotten about it. I  _  , \"Is there anything else I've done wrong, but I have never asked for your forgiveness?\"\nAgain, his  _  was immediate, \"Remember when Mom said you had to go to the  _  because Stephen was going to be born? You left us at home and  set off  hurriedly. Remember?\" I did.\n\"Well, you left in a hurry and  _  the suitcase with all the things.\" I couldn't believe all the  _  he remembered! \"After you left Mom at the hospital, you came back and you were  _  . When you got here, the suitcase had been opened and  _  was thrown all over the place. And you  _  me.\"\n\"And you didn't do it?\" I asked.\n\"No.\"\nMy heart  _  . I felt terrible. I hugged Keith and asked him to  _  me. His honesty made me think of our other twin son, Kevin. Perhaps I'd hurt him, too. I went to ask him the  _  question. Kevin's answer was as immediate as his  _  had been, \"Last Christmas you  _  us a special toy and you never bought it for us.\"\n  _  the Christmas was past, I still took my two sons to the store that day and bought them what I had promised. The  _  thing wasn't the toy. The problem was I'd made a promise all too lightly and didn't keep it as their father.",
