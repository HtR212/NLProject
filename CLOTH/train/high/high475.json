One of my sons 36 came across  a knotted   handkerchief with an old dark brown coin in it. \"Mum, can I have this?\" he asked. I took one look and was immediately   _   to another time. \"No,\" I said slowly. \"This one's   _  .\" \nMy son looked at me   _   and I explained. In 1991, I had spent five months in an African country, Niger. There were things I found terrible about this place--the heat and   _  . Street urchins   would continually thrust   their hands into your face,   _   \"Cadeau! Cadeau!\" (\"gift\" in French). \nThen, I went to neighboring Burkina Faso by taxi.   _   I began to unload, a man grabbed my daypack and disappeared in the darkness.\nThe bag had my passport, money and other things   _   to me. I was in deep trouble. In the following weeks, I regarded all locals with suspicion  . \nWalking through Burkina's streets one day, I was   _   rudely by an old woman who thrust her hand in my face. \"Cadeau! Cadeau!\" she cried. \nI'd had enough. I was sick and   _   of the country: its poverty, its thieves, the heat. I told her 46 _  in French, \"I have no 'cadeau'. A thief stole all my money. I cannot give you anything.\"\nThe beggar woman thought carefully about my   _  . Then she smiled as she   _   into the folds of her dress. \n\"I will give you a cadeau.\" She   _   an old, dark brown coin in my palm kindly. I looked at it in   _  . It was a very small amount of money--but for her, the coin 51 _  a meal. I realized she had given me a   _   disproportionate   to anything that I had ever donated. In the midst of her   _  , she was able to give me something   _  . \nI saw then the unexpected   _   of the people of Burkina Faso. I hope never to part with the coin the old woman gave me.",
