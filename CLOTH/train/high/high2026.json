I  _  this after a friend of mine, who served there as a volunteer, invited me to pay a visit to Honduras.\nThe night before I set off, I decided a warm bath would help calm my  _  nerves and help me sleep. So I  _  the hot water handle on the tub and waited. . . and waited. It took forever for the hot water to work its way through the pipes,so I  rushed through  the bath late at night. What an  _  experience!\nOn the five-hour drive to my friend's home, I  took in  the beautiful countryside. On my arrival, she took me to some families, who were in great  _  ,living in stick-and-mud houses and sleeping on dirt floors.  _  ,even in these terrible conditions,everyone I met had a smile on their face. They were so nice as to  _  we stay for coffee. Among them were two women beside a dirty pond. One pushed dirt back with a stick  _  the other dipped the water into a bucket. I shot a  _  toward the heavens,\"Dear Lord, please don't let them offer coffee.\" Suddenly,one little girl ran towards us,  _  a mango in each hand. The one in her left hand was half eaten.  _  had mixed with the dirt on her skin and small streams of mango-mud ran down her wrist. She held out her  _  hand and offered me the other mango, which I  _  accepted. Her eyes danced and joy spread into a smile. When we left, my friend pointed at a small stream beside their home and said,\"That is where they  _  . It is also where the animals drink and defecate . \"I have to say I had never been so  _  .\nThe evening I returned home, I went into my bathroom. The image of that poor little girl  _  my mind. Her bath would only take place in the cold, dirty water in the stream. I eased into my tub filled with warm water, enjoying this simple pleasure. Clean water wasn't my  _  ;it was a blessing, one I was determined to  _  with others.",
