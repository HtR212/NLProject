It is always a  _  place where family members can gather around the person who needs the  _  of well trained medical doctors and nurses. As Nicole Hagen and Ricky Beebe were born into the Hagen family in 1998, the parents were both in the delivery room. This is a  _  as the tradition has been for the father to be in the next room.  _  hospitals have a birthing room where there is an extra sofa and a chair for the father to either sit or even to sleep on next to his wife. Many  _  are taken of the new baby within a few minutes of his or her  _  . Even a video can be made with the proud father taking pictures of the doctor, nurses, mother, and baby. A nurse may take a  _  picture of the father, mother, and baby. Young children will not see the baby  _  the doctor and nurses allow them into the room many hours later. At the death of Grandma Hagen, the adult children  _  at her bedside. As she was dying, her children talked to her, read the Bible, and even sang some of her  _  songs. The nurses would check on her very often and the doctor came as his time  allowed  . She was given pain pills  so that  her last few hours would be as  _  as possible. When she died the family cried together in sorrow for the loss of their mother. Grandpa Hagen had died fourteen years  _  . Grandma Hagen was 82 when she died. Doctors operate on broken bones  _  by accidents in factories or car accidents. Children sometimes fall down stairs where an arm is  _  . Athletes get hurt in  _  of football, basketball, baseball, track, and soccer. Most injuries are repaired very successfully  thanks to  the great skill of the doctor. Illness from disease, alcohol, or smoking often requires a person to stay a long period in the hospital. People like to recover  at home  . However, if medical care is needed, a hospital may be the  _  home for some patients.",
