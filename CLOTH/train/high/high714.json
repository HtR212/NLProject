    "article": "A man hired a taxi outside the airfield. The cab had a woolen carpet with  _  lace edges. On the glass partition that  _  the driver's seat was a copy of a famous painting. Its windows were all clean.The customer was very much  _  and said to the driver, \"I've never seen a nicer  _  .\"\"Thank you for your praise.\"the driver answered  _  . \"The car isn't mine,\" said the driver. \"It belongs to the company. I used to be a  _  of cabs. When they returned, all of them were as  _  as garbage cans with cigarette butts and rubbish  _  here and there. On the seats and door-handles could be found something  _  like peanut sauce or, chewing gum.Why so? I thought if the car itself were very clean the passengers would most  _  be considerate and refrain from littering.\" \"So when I got a  _  to be a taxi-driver, I began  _  my idea into practice-to tidy and  _  the car. Now before a new passenger gets on my car, I'd make a cheek and be sure it is in good order.When my car  _  after a day's work, it always remains  _  .\" When doing a thing, one makes efforts and wants to see the result. To change others, one has to make twice the  _  but get half the result. To change oneself is the other way round-more fruit with less effort. One had better ask oneself why one makes  _  on others much more than on oneself.  _  you take enough care to do as best you can for other people's sake, your efforts will yield results, If you  look into  the inner world of your own, examine yourself and wipe out the dust and dirt, instead of fixing your eyes on other people, you will find a cheerful  _  for yourself and create a pleasant environment for others.",
