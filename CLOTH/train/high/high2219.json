There she was  _  to dig and plant as she wished. Over time, that small piece of land grew into a favorite place in the  _  . As she approached high school, Kelsey took her  _  off the garden. I didn't  _  to accept this change. It seemed acceptable that something as boring as working in the dirt gave way to the mystery of a(n)  _  social life, so I began to take care of the space. Even so, I knew it always would be Kelsey's Corner. Now my daughter is eighteen and is in the  _  weeks of her high school career. Our mailbox is filled with college admission materials,  _  me that the world has come for this young lady and that she will soon answer its  _  . Kelsey is looking forward to her wonderful college life  _  her mother and I are anxious about the coming life  _  our daughter around. Kelsey's Corner seems extremely deserted in this early spring  because of  Kelsey's leaving. One morning, when I  _  past Kelsey's Corner, I noticed some green seedlings had  _  at the foot of some dead stalks . It's  _  that life is a cycle. Kelsey's leaving is  _  one point on the cycle. Now the life wheel will roll with Kelsey as she  _  into her adult life. Let her live as she will and let her  _  when she can, and whether she comes alone or in  _  , she will be welcome home. I'll take care of Kelsey's Corner faithfully. It will also cycle annually, rolling on towards a  _  stage of our lives, one that promises a rich harvest.",
