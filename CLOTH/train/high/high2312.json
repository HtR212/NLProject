    "article": "By choosing to let go of the past ,we can sweep out the ashes that weigh us down and subtly  affect every aspect of our health, our relationships ,and our peace of mind .\n    My friend Jean was   _  after\na thirty -year marriage that produced three daughters,one son and eight  _  .Because she had literally raised them single-handedly ,Jean was  _  that the children didn't take her part  _  the\ndivorce . For months she  _  to attend any family\ncelebration to which her former husband Jim was also  _  .\nWhen I reasoned that her children's perception of the  _  with\nand between the parents was probably altogether different from hers ,she  _  to the belief that she was right.\n    One day Jean   _  in\ntears .\"Saturday is my granddaughter's birthday , and I  _  want\nto be with her , but I can't bring myself to face my  _  husband\n.\" \"Jim isn't the problem ,\" I said gently . \"It's false  _  . Instead of holding on to the painful past , which is over and done ,  _  the feelings go and get on with your life . You're depriving\nyourself of the  _  of sharing in these important\noccasions ,  _  Jim feels free to experience them. Tell me ,\nwould you rather be right ,or be happy?\"\n   That must have done the   . trick  because\nwhen Saturday arrived ,Jean appeared at her daughter's  _  bearing her famous chocolate - chip cookies and a beautiful birthday cake .\n   How   great  it feels to let\ngo ! How energizing ! And the more we practice the art of letting go of \nall negativity , the better able we become to  _  our\nthoughts, our time , and our energy to living joy-fully in the present ,  _  age we happen to be .",
