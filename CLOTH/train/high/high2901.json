This man   _  outside the Kapkenduiywa Primary School near Eldoret, Kenya. He has come many times over the last few months.\nToday, he watches the children sing in the school yard.He waits at the  _   for the head teacher. He asks her the   _   question as he always does. He asks if he can   _   the school. In the past, the head teacher told him no. She told him that this school is for children.   _  ,  this time she says yes. Today, 84-year-old Kimani Maruge will   _   his first day of school.\nWhen Maruge decided he wanted to go to school, nothing could   _   him. He said: \"At first, the head teacher said no. I   _   it must be because I did not have the blue school uniform. So, I saved my money and bought clothes.\"\nMany people   _   why Maruge wanted to start school at such an old age. The reason is  _  --- he was not able to attend school when he was younger. Maruge wanted to learn to read and write for many   _   . He wanted to be able to read   _  from friends , family and the government. He also wanted to be able to  _   official business papers. He wanted to be able to make more educated  _   .\nWhen Maruge started school, he attended with three of his children's children. They were all in higher 51 _  than Maruge. However, with much hard work, Maruge learned quickly.\n\"I want all children in the world to be educated. That is what I   _  hope to see.   _   it's hard for me to go to the school alone, the urge to learn keeps me  _  ,\"  Maruge said. \nAlthough Maruge died in 2009 at 90,  his story   lives on   . And his message is simple. As Maruge once said, \"A person is never too old to learn.\"",
