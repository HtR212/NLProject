In the business world, those who are able to solve difficult problems are the ones who are the most   _   to the employer.\nMany times the problems or challenges we face   _   us to grow and become more capable. The runner who   _   for the mile run in the Olympics by running downhill will have no chance of winning the medal   at all  . The runner who trains by running uphill is far more likely to   _   the speed and endurance  needed to win the medal.\nThe   _    thing that ever happened to boxer Gene Tunney was that he   _   both hands in the ring. But at that time his manager felt that he could   _   again punch  hard enough to be the heavyweight champion. Instead, Tunney   _   that he would become a scientific boxer and win the title as a boxer, not a slugger.   _   historians will tell you that he developed into one of the best boxers who ever fought. They   _   will tell you that as a puncher, he would not have had a chance   _   Jack Dempsey, who was considered by many to be the hardest   _    in heavyweight history. Tunney would never have been champion   _   he had not had the problem of his broken hands. \nThe   _   time you meet with a difficult climb, obstacle  or problem, you should     _   and say, \"here's my chance to grow.\"",
