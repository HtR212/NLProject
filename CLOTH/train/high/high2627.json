    "article": "It's a tradition for Ann Sutton to seek help for one or two families around Christmas. The Suttons' dinner conversation often turned to local families  in need  . This year, the youngest daughter Kate was  _  that Santa Claus would make a special visit  _  a 22-year-old single mother named Ashley.\nOne Sunday, the  _  rang. A representative from a local organization was calling to say the  _  Ann had requested for Ashley had fallen through. No Santa Claus, no presents, nothing. Ann saw the cheer  _  from her children's faces at the news. Without a word, Kate ran into her room. Soon, Kate returned with her piggy bank, her face set with  _  . And now she  _  the coins and dollar bills out, one by one, onto the kitchen table: $3.30. \"Mom,\" she told Ann, \"I know it's not much.  _  maybe this will buy a present for the baby.\"  _  everyone was reaching into pockets and purses. Soon, the money  piled up  on the kitchen table. The total: $130.\nThe next morning, Ann told her coworkers about her daughter's latest project. Throughout the day, more coworkers  dropped by  with contributions. Each time a little money came in, Ann called home. And with each  _  from her mother, Kate would scream into the phone and do a little dance of victory. With the story of Kate's gift  _  beyond Ann's office, she received more contributions. By the end of the day, the total was now $500--plenty of a Christmas for Ashley's family.\nThat evening, Kate went with her mother to  _  the money. They bought plenty of household necessities. They  _  had enough to buy food for a Christmas dinner. On Christmas Eve, Ann  _  through the pouring rain to where the family lived. When Ashley opened the door, Ann stood under her umbrella and wished the  _  woman a Merry Christmas. Then Ann began to unload the gifts from the car. With so many gifts to take inside, she abandoned the umbrella. Ashley  _  her in the rain. Soon both women were wet through, and the surprise had turned to something deeper, the kind of  _  that brought them close to tears.",
