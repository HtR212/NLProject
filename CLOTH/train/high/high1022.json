    "article": "The Parking-Lot Sweeper\nBoth my parents came from towns in Mexico. I was born in E1 Paso, Texas, and when I was four, my family moved to a housing project in East Los Angeles.\nEven though we struggled to make ends meet, my parents stressed to me and my four brothers and sisters how  _  we were to live in a great country with limitless opportunities. They  _  us with the ideas of family, faith and love.\nI got my first  _  job when I was ten. My dad injured his back working in a cardboard-box factory and was retrained as a hairstylist. He  _  space in a little shopping center and gave his shop the flowery name of Mr. Ben's Coiffure. The owner of the shopping center  _  my Dad's payment for cleaning the parking lot three  _  a week, which  _  getting up at 3 a.m. Mom and I helped  _  dustbin and pick up rubbish by hand. It took two to three hours to clean the lot. I  _  sleep in the car on the way home.I did this for two years, but the lessons I learned have  _  a lifetime. I obtained discipline and the importance of work, and learned at a(n)  _  age the importance of balancing life's competing interests----in my  _  , school, homework and a job. This  _  helped during my school years, when I worked 40 hours at a fast-food restaurant while taking a full  _  of college preparation courses.\nThe hard work  _  off. I attended the U.S. Military Academy and went on to  _  graduate degrees in law and business from Harvard.  _  , I joined a big Los Angeles law firm and was elected to the California state assembly . In these jobs and in everything else I've done, I have  _  forgotten those nights in the parking lot. The experience taught me that there is value in all work and that if people are working to  _  for themselves and their families, that is  _  we should honor.",
