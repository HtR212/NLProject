Everything he\nmakes is so perfect that I sometimes feel a bit of envy. If I  _  to remark that one of my books is so  _  and loose that I\nshall have to  _  it away, Fred takes it home with him and  _  it a few days later beautifully bound .

Outside  my work at the office,\nthe only thing that interests me is listening to classical music. I have a big  _  of records and all day long the only thing I can  think about  is  _  I am going to get home to listen to a new piece of music.\nI`ve often   _  to get Fred interested in music.\nWhen I`m in one of my talkative moods (which isn`t often , by the way), I spend\nhours  pointing out  the beauties of a particular piece.

Getting home from work is one of the few things I`m good at. It`s certainly the only time I ever   _   .But this day I excelled  myself. I had just bought a new record of some light music and I could hardly wait to listen to it.",
