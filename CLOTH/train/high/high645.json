    "article": "Justin, my brother, has been missing for two weeks. Now I  _  him very much. I'm worried that something  _  has happened to him. I'm sure he  came home  that night at about 11 o'clock, because I heard him playing his favorite CD in his bedroom. But where has he gone? Yesterday a girl named Marvies told me that  _  was once taken away by aliens from outer space. They did some research on her. Marvies said that the whole experience was really terrible,  _  luckily they returned her home. If Justin has been taken away by aliens too, I hope they will  _  him soon. My parents have been worrying about Justin. Soon after he was found missing, they called  the police  . However, the police are not making  much progress  in the case . They are very puzzled, saying Justin might have been murdered. Dad is very  _  with them. He doesn't think they are doing their job well. Mum is so worried that she  _  sleep well. I hope Justin will come home soon and tell us what happened to him. I want all of us to be together again.",
