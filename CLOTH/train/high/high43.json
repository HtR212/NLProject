He was very touched, and felt good .Because he was not able to  _  the warmth of her smile, he was watching her as he was  _  . She was giving the same  _  to all the people who walked into the supermarket. The businessman started thinking if she hated doing the same thing. So he asked, \"My dear lady, are you  _  of doing this job?\" The lady smiled and said, \"No, sir, I have  _  here for the last 10 years and I love my job.\" The businessman was surprised and asked, \"Why have you stayed here for ten years, and why do you like your job  _  much?\" The lady said, \"Because I am doing something good for my  _  .\" The businessman found this interesting. He asked, \"Why?\" The lady said, \"As most of our customers are  _  , they spend foreign currency here. So our country has a lot of money and becomes richer. People who are happy with our service will  _  more often and spend more money in our country.\" Surprised by her  _  , the businessman thanked her.
