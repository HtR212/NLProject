I told her I would mess it up,   _   I had never worked at the bar before. I    _   that instead of making money, I would end up owing it.\n\"You can do it,\" said my mother, \"   _   , you won't get much business until lunch.\"\n\"But I'll never remember the orders, and I'm no good   _   money. Please, Mom, don't   _   me.\"\n\"Then I'll help you,\"she said.\nI shrugged my shoulders. I thought my mother's    _   was a bad one, but I       _  .\nWhen I got to the bar the next day, I found my mother was   _   . Because the weather that day was rainy and cold, people wanted hot snacks and drinks.    At first   , I was really slow at taking the orders and making change. The line of people grew, and everybody seemed   _   , I was so nervous that my hands shook, and I     _   a cup into pieces. What a mess! Then my mother came to   _   me, and she also showed me how to make    _  . If someone gave me $ 5 for something that cost $ 3.25, I handed over   _   quarters and a dollar and said, \"75 cents makes four dollars, plus one dollar makes five.\" Things went more   _   after that.\nBy the end of the day, I could remember orders,   add up   the bill, and make change quickly with a smile. I was even a little   _   when the sun came out and dried up business. My mother said she was proud of me, and when she   _   that I work at the snack bar again next year, I did not even shrug. I was too busy   _     the restaurant I would open one day.",
