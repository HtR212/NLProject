    "article": "The first Christmas I spent away from home happened to be in England. At that time, shops in Poland were still   _   bare and decorations didn't appear in the shop windows until about a week before the actual celebration of Christmas. Therefore, I was   _   to see so many English shops   _   decorated from top to bottom as early as November. I was enchanted  and I loved it. By the middle of December, however, it had started to   _   me and when I could hear Christmas carols in every   _   I went to, I started to feel sad and   _  . Never mind, I thought, as I was really looking forward to   _   Christmas the English way.\nI spent Christmas Eve with an English family. The house was tastefully   _  , there was a Christmas tree and roaring fire in the fireplace. My first   _   on that day came when instead of going to church, everybody went to the local pub. Surely, I thought, there can't be anything   _   about it as they go there every Friday, Saturday and   _   in the middle of the week. So I missed our Polish special moments that happen on Christmas Eve, our traditional supper, breaking the bread and   _   each other only good things.\nAt first I thought that I   _   spending Christmas the way we do it in Poland but looking back, I know that it was a(n)   _   experience. Now, whenever I happen to spend Christmas in England, the thing I   _   most is the way it differs from the Polish way of celebrating Christmas.",
