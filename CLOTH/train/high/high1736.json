    "article": "My grandparents were married for over half a century, and played their own special game from the time they had met each other. The goal of their   _   was to write the word \"shmily\" in a surprise place for the other to find. They   took turns   leaving \"shmily\" around the house, and   as soon as  one of them discovered it, it was the other's turn to hide it once more. \n   Little notes with \"shmily\" scribbled  hurriedly were  _   on dashboards and car seats, or taped to steering wheels. It took me a long time before I was able to   _  appreciate my grand-parents' game. Skepticism  has  _  me from believing in true love---one that is pure and lasting. However, I never doubted my grandparents'   _  . It was more than their flirtatious  little games; it was a way of life. Their relationship was based on a devotion and passionate affection which not everyone is   _   to experience.   \n  But there was a dark   _   in my grandparents' life: my grandmother had breast cancer. As always, Grandpa was  _   her every step of the way. He comforted her in their yellow room, painted that way so that she could always be surrounded by sunshine. \n Now the cancer was again   _   her body. With the help of a cane and my grandfather's steady hand, they went to church every morning.  _   my grandmother grew steadily weaker until,   _  , she could not leave the house anymore. For a while, Grandpa would go to church alone, praying to God to watch over his wife. \nThen one day, what we all feared finally   _  . Grandma was\ngone. \"Shmily.\" It was   _  in yellow on the pink ribbons of my\ngrandmother's funeral bouquet . As the crowd   _   and the last mourners  turned to leave, Grandpa stepped up to my grandmother's casket and, taking a deep   _  , he began to sing to her. Through his tears and grief, the song   _   as a deep and throaty lullaby . \nShaking with my own sorrow, I will never forget that   _  . For I knew that, although I couldn't begin to understand the depth of their love,  I had been   _   to witness its unmatched beauty. SHMILY: See how much I love you.",
