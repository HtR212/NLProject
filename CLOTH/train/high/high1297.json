    "article": "A couple of weeks ago, I made a trip to Toronto with my granddaughter who just turned three years old. The two of us were on our way to   _  her parents and my wife, her   _   who had been gone for over a week. We were all anxious to   get together  again. As I pulled out of Mamere and Papere's driverway in Chelmsford, Hailee and I were both   _  about the trip and couldn't wait to arrive at our   _  .\nWhen we completed the\"SEVEN\"-hour trip to Toronto later that day, the reunion was  ly  _  and I can sincerely say I enjoyed every single minute of that   _   journey.\nHailee is at that \"I want to   _  it myself\" stage of her life. And if you can just get over the \"hurry-up syndrome  \" we acquire as   _  , it is wonderful to witness that putting a straw into the   _  in a juice box for the very first time could be such an earth-shattering event or being   _   enough to actually open the fridge door for the first time or putting on your own   _   on the right feet -- would be so     _  ?\nI'll never forget the look on her face the day she was able to   _   into my truck by herself. She finally    stood up  on my seat, holding onto the steering wheel   and declared   _  \"I did it!\" And when she could actually put her own seat belt on, what a(n)   _   !\nHave you ever watched a three-year-old   _  to sip   a McDonald's milkshake through a straw? It is hard enough for an adult, too. And   _   every time the icy solution   touched her lips, you could see the   _  in her eyes. I learned that you can't hurry a child through a milkshake.",
