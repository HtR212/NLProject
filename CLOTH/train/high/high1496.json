    "article": "While waiting to pick up a friend at the airport in Portland, Oregon, I noticed a man coming toward me carrying two light bags. He stopped right next to me to  _  his family. First he moved to his youngest son as he laid down his bags. They gave each other a long, loving hug.  _  they separated, I heard the father say, \"It's so good to see you, son. I missed you so much!\" His son smiled somewhat shyly and replied softly, \"Me, too, Dad!\" Then the man stood up, gazed in the  _  of his oldest son and said, \"You're already quite the young man. I love you very much, Zach!\" They too hugged a most loving, tender hug. After several  _  , he turned to his wife and declared, \"I've saved the best for last!\" and  _  to give his wife the longest, most passionate kiss I  _  remember seeing. For an instant they  _  me of newlyweds , but I knew by the age of their kids that they couldn't possibly be. I puzzled about it for a moment and gathered my courage to  _  ask, \"Wow! How long have you been married?\" \"Almost twelve years.\" he replied,  _  breaking his gaze from his lovely wife's face. \"Well then, how long have you been away?\" I asked. The man  _  turned and looked at me,. \"Two whole days\" Two days? I was  _  . By the intensity of the greeting, I had  _  he'd been gone for at least several weeks -- if not months. I know my expression  _  me. Hoping to stop our conversation politely and continue with my  _  for my friend, I said almost immediately, \"I hope my  _  is still that passionate after twelve years!\" The man suddenly  _  smiling. He looked me straight in the eye, and with power that burned right into my soul, he told me something that left me a  _  person. He told me, \"Don't  _  , friend ...decide!\" Then with wonderful smile, he and his family turned and left together. I was still watching that special family walk just out of sight when my friend  came up  to me and asked, \"What are you looking at?\" Without  _  , and with a curious sense of certainty, I replied, \" My future!\"",
