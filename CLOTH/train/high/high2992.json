Once upon a time, a man   _  on a long\ntrip to visit his friend and took a swan as a gift. But the swan  _  from its cage on the way and when he tried to  _  it, he got hold of nothing but a  _  .\nInstead of returning home, he continued his  _  taking\nthe swan feather with him. When his friend received this  _  gift, he was deeply moved. And the  _  'The\ngift is nothing much, but it's the thought that counts.' was  _  far and wide.\nChinese used to   _  one\nhand in the other in front of the chest as a salute. This  _  has a history of more than 2,000 years but nowadays it is  _  used except on the Spring Festival. And shaking hands is more popular\nand  _  on formal occasions. Bowing was often\nused by people in a  _  position such as\nsubordinates , students, and attendants.   _  at present Chinese youngsters tend to simply nod as a greeting.\nIt is common social practice to   _  the junior to the senior, or the familiar to the unfamiliar. When you\nstart a talk  _  a stranger, topics such as\nweather, food, or  _  are a good choice to\nbreak the ice. With a  _  , a chat about current\naffairs, sports, the stock market or his job usually goes  _  . Similar to Western customs, you should be  _  in\nasking a woman private questions. However, talking about her job or family life\nwill never put you into danger.",
