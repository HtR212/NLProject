    "article": "One day in 11thgrade, when I went into a classroom to wait for a friend of mine, Mr. Washington, the math teacher, suddenly  turned up  and asked me to go to the board to write down a math problem and  _  it out. I told him that I couldn't do it. And he asked, \"Why not?\" I said, \"Because I'm not one of your students.\" He said, \"It doesn't matter. Go the board  _  \" I said, \"I can't do that.\" He asked, \"Why not?\"  I paused for I was somewhat  _  \nI said, \"Because I'm the so called  _  student.\" He\nHe came from behind his desk and looked at me  _  and said. \"Don't ever say that again. Someone's opinion of you does not have to become your  _  . Look at a man the  _  that he is, he only becomes worse. But look at him  as if  he were what he could be, then he becomes what he should br.\"  It was a very  _  moment for me. For one thing, I was  _  because the other students  laughed at  me. They knew that I was \"incurably poor\" in academic learning. But for another, I felt  _  because he began to bring to my attention that I did not have to live within the  _  of other people.\nMr. Washington's words made  _  difference to me. I start to believe everyone has certain  _  within them, and so in me. I used to do  _  in the fifth grade and was put from the fifth grade into the fourth grade and then failed again in the eighth grade. But I know all these  _  in the past. So I'm happy to  _  that I'm a brand new person now and I will be someone who can  _  something in the future.",
