Christy decided to get together with other trail  _  to ask the city council to  _  a bike path along the unused land. Christy  _  petition . She and other riders asked all of their biking friends if they would  _  the list, and they gathered 300 signatures. The city council evaluated the  _  and, more  _  , agreed to allow the bike trail.
