Do you know  _  the teddy bear got its name? On November 14, 1902, US President Theodore Roosevelt went to Mississippi to  _  a problem. After a day's work, Roosevelt went hunting. However, he was unhappy  _  he couldn't find  _  big game to shoot during the hunt. Legend has it  _  his host wanted the hunting trip to be  _  , so he went out and found a bear cub and  tied  it to a tree for Roosevelt to shoot. But Roosevelt  _  and asked him to  _  it free. After  hearing  about this, artist Clifford Berryman drew a cartoon of Roosevelt and the bear. He then  published  the cartoon in The Washington Post. A few days  _  , a shopkeeper saw the cartoon and had his wife  make  many toy bears  based on  the bear in the cartoon. They named them  _  Roosevelt's nickname Teddy.  _  early 1903, they sold these teddy bears in the shop and many people came to buy them. Now it is  _  with a lot of people.",
