    "article": "For some people, the sight of a mouse can be reason to scream. For other mice, the same sight can be reason to sing.\nMice will probably  _  sing their way to any concert, but researchers in the United States have found  _  that mice do,  in fact  , sing.\nScientists already knew that mice makeultrasonic  sounds--noises that are toohigh-pitched  for people to hear  _  special equipment.\nTo find out whether mice put such sounds together in song-like  _  , the researchers recorded the sounds of 1 mice. Using computer  _  , they were able to separate the sounds into specific types ofsyllables , and found the mice produced about 10 syllables per second.\nThe results showed that nearly all of the mice repeatedsequences  of syllables in different patterns. That's enough to meet the definition of what scientists  _  song. But not all scientists are  _   that what the mice are doing is  _  singing. To prove it, the researchers must show that there's learning involved. And, they need to   talk over  why the mice sing.",
