    "article": "Tony Tomei was well-known in Los Alamos, N.M. for his heroic action when the forest fires swept through last May. Tomei had  _   run away from his house, which was   in danger  . But soon after reaching a safe place, Tomei  _  that although he had saved most of his collection of accordions (a kind of musical instruments), his precious Italian Bugari Armando accordion was  _  in the house. He raced home to   _  it. \"When I drove up, there was a lot of smoke,\" he says, and at that moment he made   the preparation  . \"I was going to  take up  the fire. I was the only one left to  _   the neighbors' house.\" Tomei, 52, an engineer and accordion instructor, had no idea what a great danger he would  _  . With a garden hose  ,he spent the   _   few hours putting out small spot fires.\nThen the  _  picked up, and the fire began moving slowly from the valley 60 feet below toward his home. He attempted to put out the fire but without any  _  . The fire and smoke blew up beside him,  _   him to the ground, where he got hold of a tree. \"I couldn't breathe. I couldn't see. I just stuck my face in the dirt.\"\n  _  , the wind changed. Against a frightening background of house burning up and down his street, Tomei fought through much of the  _   without any more water and  _  a couple of tools he could get to keep small fires away from his neighbors' house.\nAt sunrise he got his first real look at what had left of the neighborhood. \"I saw all those damaged house and thought, oh, my God,\"  _   he'd saved his home along with two others'.\nWhen his neighbor Nancy Tenbrink  _   to the house that she'd thought was lost, she  _  threw her arms around Tomei. \"My house was important, but his life was much more   _  ,\" she says. \"I'm deeply thankful for what he did for us.\"",
