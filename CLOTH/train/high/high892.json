She was  _  the first\nnight in the car, with terrible deep darkness outside.\n   \"Where are we going, Daddy?\" asked the daughter. \"To your uncle's house in Germany.\" Father answered.\n   \"Have you been to his   _  before?\" \"No.\"\n   \"Then, do you know the  _  ?\" \"Maybe, we can read the map.\"\n   Short pause. \"Do you know how to read the map?\" \"Yes, we will get there  _  .\nDon't worry.\"\n   The same dialogue  _  a\nfew times within the first night, and also the second night.  _  on the third night, his daughter was quiet. Father thought\nthat she might have fallen  _  , but when he looked\ninto the mirror, he saw that she was awake and was just  looking around  calmly. He couldn't help wondering  _  she was not\nasking the questions anymore.\n  \"Do you know where we are going?\" \"Germany, uncle's house.\"\n  \" Do you know how we are getting there?\" \"No.\"\n  \" Then why aren't you asking anymore?\" \"Because Daddy is  _  .\"\n  Because Daddy is driving. This answer from a 3 years old girl has then become the  _  and\nhelp this man for many years whenever he has questions and  _  on\nhis journey. We may  _  the destination and sometimes we may\njust know it  _  the little girl-\"Germany\", without\nunderstanding where or what it  _  is. We do not know the way. We\ndo not know how to read the map. We do not know if we can find  _  along the way to eat in. But the little girl knows the most  _  thing-Daddy is driving-and so she is safe and secure. She\nknows that her Daddy will  _  all that she needs.",
