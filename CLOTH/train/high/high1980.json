I am now 40 years old, so it's been a lot of years that I've had my mom's loving  _  and direction behind me pushing me gently when I need it. When I was ill, mom would take care of me  _  . When I had a terrible dream, she would never  yell at  me for stealing into her bed. When I graduated from college, she took  _  in me as I walked across that stage. When life would get me down, she would tell me that ,it's always dark  _  the down ,She's always been my greatest  _  keeping-me up when life tried to defeat me. She never told me that anything was impossible or that I set my goals too high. With a gentle guiding hand she got me back on the right:,  _  if I faltered . A  _  thank you will never be enough for the kindness and love she has shown to us over the years. My mom  _  more than flowers, candy or other gifts. There isn't a gift in the world that could ever  _  my thanks for everything she has done for me over the years.",
