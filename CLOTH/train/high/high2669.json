Someone then asked her to coach a children's dancing group.From that point on,she realized that she could not  _  dancing.So,she started to do some of her old routines,but,having lost her arm,she had also lost her  _  .It took a while before she could even make simple turns and spins without  _  . Then a few months later she  heard of  a man in his twenties who had lost a leg in an accident.She was determined to find him and  _  him to dance with her.He had never danced.And to dance with one leg...He said,\"Are you  _  with me?No way!\" But,she didn't  give up  ,and he agreed to think about it.\"I have nothing else to do anyway,\" he thought.Then she started to  _  him dancing.The two  broke up  a few times because he had no concept of using muscle,how to  _  his body,and knew none of the  _  things about dancing.When she became  _  and lost patience with him,he would walk out.  _  ,they came back together and started training  _  . They hired a choreographer to  _  routines for them.She would fly high (held by him) with both arms (a sleeve for an arm) flying in the air.He could bend  _  by one leg with her leaning on him,etc. When I watched this I didn't  _  realize that she was missing an arm  _  I was focusing on the guy with only one leg.Really quite amazing!",
