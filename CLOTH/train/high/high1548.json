I used to call people  all the time  , from the moment I woke up to the time I went to sleep. I  _  to be phoned, I wanted to phone. Just one more call. It started socially--a few calls each day. It seemed  _  , just a quick chat. Gradually though, the  _  got worse. Soon it was  _  use, until, finally, addiction. And it began to affect my  _  . During the day I would disappear for  a quick  call. If I couldn't make a call, I spent the whole time waiting for the phone to ring. Getting more and more  _  , in the end, I would ring someone, then someone else,  _  myself just one more call. I was phoning people and  _  messages to make sure  _  calls would see me through the day. I used to arrive at friends' homes and before the door was closed, go straight for the phone with the  _  \"Is it OK if I just use the phone...?\" At work, I became  _  when my fellow workers tried to  _  me from using the phone. And one day I hit my boss (with the phone). Finally the police caught me  _  a phone box that had taken my last one pound coin, and I was  _  to see a psychiatrist . I haven't  _  a phone in the house for three weeks now, and it's several days  _  I used a phone box. I try not to watch TV because there are  _  people on it making phone calls.
