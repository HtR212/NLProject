    "article": "That night we lay on the floor in the room and I listened to the silk-worms eating. The silk-worms  _  on shelves of mulberry  leaves and all night you could hear them eating and a dropping sound in the leaves. I myself didn't want to  _  because I had been living for a long time with the  _  that if I ever shut my eyes in the dark and let myself go, my  _  would go out of my body. I had been that way for a long time,  _  since I was sleepless at night and felt it go out of me and go off and then  come back  .I tried never to think about it, but it had started to go since, in the nights, just at the  _  of going off to sleep, and I could only stop it by a very great  _  . So while now I am fairly sure that it would not really have gone out, yet then, that summer, I was unwilling to make the  _  .\nI had different ways of  _  myself while I lay awake. I would think of a trout  stream I had fished along when I was a boy; and fish its whole length very  _  in my mind; fishing under all the logs, all the turns of the  _  , the deep holes and the clear shallow stretches, sometimes  _  trout and sometimes losing them. I would stop fishing at noon to eat my lunch; sometimes on a log  _  the stream; sometimes on a high bank under a tree; and I always ate my lunch very slowly and  _  the stream below me while I ate. Often I ran out of bait  because I would take ten  _  with me in a tobacco tin when I started. When I had used them all I had to find  _  worms and sometime it was very difficult digging in the bank of the stream  _  the cedar trees kept out the sun and there was no grass but only the  _  wet earth and often I could find no worms. Always I found some kind of bait, but one time in the swamp I could find no bait at all and had to  cut up  one of the trout I had caught and used him for bait.",
