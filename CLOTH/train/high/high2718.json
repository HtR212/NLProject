    "article": "It took place at the Biltmore Hotel, which, to my eight-year-old mind, was just about the fancies place to eat. My   _  , my mother, and I were having lunch after a morning spent shopping. I ordered a Salisbury steak. When brought to the table, it was   _   by a plate of peas. I do not like peas now. I did not like peas then. I have always hated peas. And I   _   was not about to eat them now. \"Eat your peas,\" my grandmother said. \n\"Mother,\" said my mother in her   _   voice. \"He doesn't like peas. Leave him alone.\" \nMy grandmother did not reply. She 35 _  in my direction, looked at me in the eye, and said the   _   words that changed my life: \"I'll pay you five dollars if you eat those peas.\"  \nI had  ly no idea of the coming   _  . I only knew that five dollars was an enormous, nearly   _   amount of money, and as awful as peas were, only one plate of them stood between me and the   _   of that five dollars. I began to force the terrible things down my   _  . \nMy mother was very angry. My grandmother had that   _   look of someone who has thrown down an unbeatable trump card . \"I can do what I want, Ellen, and you can't stop me.\" My mother glared at her mother. She glared at me.\nI, of course, kept shoving peas down my throat. The   _   made me nervous, and every single pea made me want to throw up, but the magical image of that five dollars   _   before me, and I finally swallowed down every last one of them. My grandmother handed me the five dollars in a(n)   _   way. My mother continued to glare in silence. And the   _   ended. Or so I thought. \nMy grandmother left for Aunt Lillian's a few weeks later. That night, at dinner, my mother served my favorite foods. Along with them came a big, steaming bowl of peas. She offered me some peas, and I certainly   _  . My mother fixed me with a cold   _   as she put a huge pile of peas onto my plate. Then came the words that were to   _   me for years. \n\"You ate them for   _  ,\" she said. \"You can eat them for love.\" \nWhat possible argument could I gather against that? There was none. I ate them that day and every other time they were   _   thereafter.",
