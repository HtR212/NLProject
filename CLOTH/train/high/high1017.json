Quickening my  _  , I reached into my shoulder bag to get my key ring. But the key ring wasn't there! \"Hey! Let's  _  the lady!\" one boy shouted. Suddenly, my fingers wrapped around a  _  key in my purse. I did not even  _  if it was for my car. I reached my car and the key  _  ! I opened the door, slid in and locked it -- just as the teenagers surrounded the car.  _  , I started the engine and drove away. Some teachers went back to the school with me  _  .
