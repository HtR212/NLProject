    "article": "Do you remember the name of your kindergarten teacher? I do,mine. Her name was Mrs. White. And I  _  thinking she must be some older relation of Walt Disney's Snow White,  _  she had the same bright blue eyes,short dark hair,red lips and fair skin.\nI don't remember much about what we  _  in her class,but my mother once told me that we used to  _  a lot. And I would bring back what I wrote and she would look at it and see there were so many  _  . But no red corrections.  And always a star. Sometimes  _  a Good! But it  _  my mother, so one day when she met Mrs. White at a Parent-Teacher meeting,she asked her why she never  _  my mistakes and why she never red-pencilled in the right  _  of words or pointed out grammatical errors.\nAnd Mrs. White said \"The children are just beginning to get  _  about using words,about forming sentences. I don't want to dampen that enthusiasm with  _  ink. Spelling and grammar can wait but the wonder of words  _  ...\" I grew up learning to use words with loving  _  like that.\nI  1ook back  now and think she must have been a rather  _  teacher -- to exercise such red-pen restraint  ,to  _  the joy,wonder and excitement of expression to flower -- however faultily -- like that,because to bloom is better than not to bloom.\nI used to  _  beautiful a lot. Never could I quite remember that the e went  _  the a. Eventually the e and a settled into their right places. I am glad I didn't wait on them though. Pretty is easier to spell but it doesn't hold as much as you  _  sometimes.\nAnd thanks to Mrs. White I felt no  _  about writing what I meant even if I couldn't quite spell it out. Because Life isn't Pretty. It's Beautiful.",
