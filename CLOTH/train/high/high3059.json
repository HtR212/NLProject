Katie Couric spoke with Dr. Barbara Greenberg, a parenting expert and clinical psychologist, all about how parents can   _   with their teens, and finally get some answers. Every parent wants to know what is going on inside their teenager's   _  , and while the normal instinct   is to give them the third degree   about their day, Dr. Greenberg strongly   _   us not to question teens closely for long, who are   _   to get upset or excited all of a sudden.\n  _   direct, general questions like \"How was your day?\" or \"How was the date?\". Teens will respond more positively to   _   questions like \"How was the movie?\"  _   they aren't ready to give you a whole bunch of information at once. Listening is an important part of any   _  , and interrupting your child may not get you much   _  .\nMost adolescents are discovering who they are and how they   fit into   society. While it might seem that their eyes are laden with laser beams   and you are their next target, they are also under a lot of pressure, both socially and academically. Let them   _   themselves freely; this is their way of telling you about their   _  .\nEven though the idea isn't \"cool\", research has found that about 80% of teens admire and want to spend time with their parents. Teens really love their parents!\n  _  , but believe it. They are   _   between wanting that precious independence and   holding on to   mom and dad.\nShow your kids at an early age that it's okay to talk about anything at home.   _   like drugs, sex and alcohol can be scary for both   _   to discuss, but having these conversations has been proven to help teens keep a healthy lifestyle.\nIt is totally possible to   _   a strong relationship with your teen! Just remember to stay calm,   listen to   what they have to say, and don't take that sigh when you ask about their homework too personally.",
