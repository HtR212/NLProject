    "article": "My friend Jenny from Germany spent some time traveling in India. She  _  the country so much that she always got attracted to it. While there, she stayed with Leela, her friend who was Indian.  Apart from  the gazes that she got as a foreigner, Jenny always had language problems. It was very difficult for her to  _  )  _  from her own country.\nOne day, a  _  thing happened. Along with Leela, she went to visit an orphanage. All the children there were tiny; each one fell  _  between the ages of fifteen days to one-and-a-half years old.\nAfter some initial   _  , Jenny slowly went to the kids and sat beside them. After some time, one of the kids smiled at her. She felt  _  towards that child.\nShe slowly held the child and started singing a rhyme in  _  . The small child continued to smile and started  _  after her. The words that escaped the little mouth were much different from those that Jenny hummed, but the  _  was the same.\nWanting to join in the  _  , another kid went up to Jenny and started humming the rhyme. They shared a million  _  together.\n  _  Leela's eyes on her, she blurted( ) an explanation straight from her heart: \"See, I don't have  _  \n  _  problems here. We speak; we communicate!\"\nAnd she continued with her rhyme  as if  she didn't want to disturb the child's smile.\nThat day, it was  _  for Leela and the others in the orphanage to see such a heartwarming scene. In that moment, she understood: we're all simply human, and we have the ability to  _  with each other; it's  _  , and comes from deep inside.",
