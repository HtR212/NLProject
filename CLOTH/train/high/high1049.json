If only someone could  _  show us a way to go, a direction to take, we wouldn't feel so  _  of which path to pursue. We think that, with only a little  _  , we'll surely end up in the right place.\n  _  on a regular flight from Detroit to Tri-City Airport must have felt a little more than  _  during the flight attendant's greeting as their flight started. She  _  the passengers and stated that the destination would be Midland. A few concerned passengers  _  her, so the flight attendant, obviously not familiar with the area,  _  herself by saying that they would be  _  in \"Tri-City\" and Bay City.\nChuckles rippled along the aisle as she  _  tried again. This time she informed passengers that the destination would be Saginaw. Now  _  broke out.\nAt that point, an authoritative voice came over the intercom   and  _  her. \"I'm your pilot, folks,\" he said. \"Don't  _  -- I know where we're going.\"\nIt's nice when someone knows the  _  . And there is wisdom in seeking help when necessary. Other people can be valuable.  _  we cannot always depend on others for the  _  answers for living our lives. In the end, nobody can point us to all the best  _  for life's problems; nobody else can  _  us to the path that is just right for us. We find that way ourselves. We find the way by  _  Listening to our hearts -- for the direction we need is almost always there, deep within.\nSo if you feel a bit lost, don't worry. This may be a  _  time to listen. And remember -- your pilot knows where you're going.",
