    "article": "Yu Bingbing is a 28yearold market research manager. When she is  _  her way to work each morning, she cannot help feeling  _  about whether she has locked the door of her apartment and  _  off the gas. \"I'm usually  _  with these feelings for the entire day,\" Yu said. Working at an international pharmaceutical firm, Yu looks older than she is and her heavily madeup face always has a(n)  _  look. \"Since I have been  _  to a managerial position, I lose my temper with my parents and husband more frequently just because of some  _  things,\" she said, adding that  _  wrinkles and acne on her face have irritated her even more, and even luxury cosmetics cannot  _  her. \"I have to work six days a week and don't even have extra offtime when I'm sick,\" she said. \"I have to  _  myself to become a workaholic since the competition in my company is really  _  and I also have to pay a 5,000 yuan monthly mortgage, besides saving a certain amount of money for my  _  baby.\" Life is like riding on a  _  for Yu and many other members of China's post80s generation, the first generation  _  after the  _  of the familyplanning policy and the group to benefit  _  from the country's opening up policy and its booming economy. Being the only child in their family, and without much to trouble them during their youth, most of them were taken good care of or even  _  by their parents and grandparents. Having such a  _  carefree youth--when this generation reached  _  and had to  _  with soaring prices, the high cost of raising children and intense competition in the workplace--they suffered a rude awakening. According to statistics, the population of China's post80s generation is over 200 million. The media usually refers to them as \"slaves\" to property, credit cards, children and marriage.",
