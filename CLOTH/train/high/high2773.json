    "article": "One day, our teacher, Mr. Sims, announced that the destination of the seventhgrade field trip would be the amusement park. The classroom buzzed with  _  as the girls discussed what they would wear and what they should bring with them. I sat back and listened,  _  that my parents did not have the money to send me. It made me  _  to feel so leftout. But not Danny. He  _  told everyone that he wouldn't be going. When Mr. Sims asked him why, Danny stood up and  _  , \"It's too much money for me right now. My dad hurt his back and has been out of  _  for a while. I can't ask my parents for money.\" Sitting back down in his seat, Danny held his head up proudly, even though  _  had begun. I could only shrink in my  _  , and surely those whispers must be about me if they found out I would not be going either. \"Danny, I'm very proud of you for understanding the  _  that your parents are in. Not every student of your  _  has that ability,\" Mr. Sims replied.  _  not everyone accepted Danny after that day, he won  _  the respect of many of us. I was especially  _  by how he didn't back down under peer pressure. For so long, I could never  _  to my friends that I couldn't afford to go there.  _  , in order to continue to  _  in, I lied about why I couldn't do things and  came up  with excuse after excuse. By standing up and admitting he was poor, Danny changed my life. His selfconfidence made it  _  for all of us to understand that what his parents had or didn't have did not  _  who he was. After that, I no longer felt I had to lie about my family's situation. And Danny,  _  because of his courage and honesty than his great looks, is someone I will never forget.",
