Except for  writing with his toes, he was completely unable to do anything in his life. As the two brothers grew up together, they had their  _  of problems and they would often quarrel. Then one day, his younger brother decided to  _  separate from him, living his own life as many  _  people do. So he was heart-broken and didn't know what to do. A  _  misfortune happened to a girl, too. One night she tried to  _  meals for her sick mother, only to overturn the kerosene light on the stove, resulting in a fire which took her  _  away. Though her elder sister in another city  _  her willingness to take care of her, she was  _  to learn to be completely independent. At school, she  _  studied hard.
