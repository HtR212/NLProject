    "article": "There was once a family of three sons.The boys were not kind to one another.In fact, they   _  constantly, each one trying to outdo the others in some sort of sport.12 For instance ,  if one boy were building a raft,  13 another had to build a canoe.Then the third had to build an even larger and finer boat.Because each of them worked   alone  , their work was difficult, and the results were not always    _  . Of their three boats, not one was seaworthy.There was little16 _ in their home.\nTheir father despaired.He  _  they would never learn to cooperate.He decided to try to teach them a18 _ .He gathered up a cartful of thin reeds and tied them together with strong vines .At dinner, he announced a( an)19 _ : \"Look at this bundle of twigs ,\" he shouted.\"I    _  you to break it in half, for whoever  figure out  the secret will win a life of rich rewards.\"\nThe oldest son took the bundle in his  _  hands.He was strong, and he used all of his23 _ to try to break the reeds, but they would not be broken.Finally he gave up, and his younger brother24 took on the challenge.He balanced the reeds across the tabletop and used all of his weight to try to break the bundle,   _  it did not break.Finally, he gave up, and the youngest brother took the  _  bound twigs in his hands.He, too, struggled with all of his strength to snap the bundle into two pieces, but it would not break.\nFinally, the father took the bundle from them.He untied the vine that  _  the reeds together.He then divided the bundle into three  _  piles of twigs.\"Now break your twigs into two,\" he said.Each boy, one 29 at a time , did as his father asked.The task was easy. Each bundle broke with hardly any effort.\"When you divide your work, it is easy and you can  _   much,\" the old man said.And with that, the young men understood that alone each of them was weak.But together, they had great strength.",
