When I went outside to  _  what was wrong, I discovered an elderly neighbor had fallen down. She was  _  in pain so I helped her inside her house and  _  her on the bed.\nI noticed how  _  her place was and it was obvious she hadn't cleaned it for a while. She insisted she didn't need an  _  and that someone would be around soon, so I put a bottle of water at her side and  _  .\nOn my return, I felt sad that, although we had been neighbors for 18 months, apart from a few smiles, we hadn't  _  . I hadn't even noticed she hadn't been  _  for weeks due to painful back.\nThat weekend I met my grandma for her 80thbirthday, and I noticed how  _  her flat seemed in comparison with my  _  . Then I remembered that my grandma was usually visited by her relatives.  On the contrary  , my neighbor, as far as I knew, had no family regularly  dropping by  .\nWhen I returned home I went to visit her, but she didn't  _  my knocks. I walked inside. She was more  _  now than when she started to see me. She explained she was Ok. Yet, unable to  bend down  due to her back, she could not unpack groceries that a delivery boy had left at floor level and her kitchen was filled with  _  because she was unable to take it out by herself.\n  _  we've become good friends and chat every day. Now, every time I  _  from putting out her garbage,  _  her mails or just chatting, I feel a deep sense of  _  and peace, so I am really content that I can help others.",
