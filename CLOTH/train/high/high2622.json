As the business was   closing down  , I remembered one saying, \"One\ndoor closes and another one opens .\"\n  _   the years I've learned that everything happens   _  as\nit should be. It didn't mean that I was  _  about what was taking\nplace, but situations always seem to  _  themselves out. I usually  _  out the lessons I learned, even if it takes years.\nI am   _  grateful for where I am at this exact moment, and if you begin to be grateful\nfor being exactly where you are, you will also see how your life  _  .\nWhen you become grateful for what you have in the present, it   _  more to come\ninto your future. If you don't have money right now, do your best not to  _  you are poor or in debt;  _  , begin thinking about what you want\nas far as  _  goes. Start focusing on financial freedom instead of  _  or debt.\nYou must stay focused on what you want and rid yourself of   _  thoughts, as they\nwill bring on more of what you don't need. This is just how the mind  _  .\nI found making a(n)   _  ,at some point in the day, of things I'm grateful for makes a huge    _  . I believe I have a better night's sleep when I do this  _  before going to bed.\nWhat am I grateful for today ? Sometimes it's as   _  as \"having healthy\nhands and fingers to type\". Be grateful for who you are and  above all  be\ngrateful to be part of this wonderful universe.",
