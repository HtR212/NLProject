    "article": "It was a perfect day, just the right kind of day to go fishing My 13-year-old son Jonathan and I had been  _  this trip for weeks, and now we were sitting on the shore of a beautiful lake. We  _  and talked, and then, suddenly, I saw small waves  where  my float had been. I waited, thinking it would pop right back up again, but the float stayed  _  the water and my heart started to beat  _  .After a few more seconds, my fishing rod was suddenly pulled off the stick it was leaning on  in front of  me and it was being  _  towards the water. I firmly caught hold of the fishing rod and lifted it up. This fish was  _  ! Slowly, my son balanced on two rocks and leaned down to get the giant off the fishhook. For just one second, he lost his  _  and reached up with his right hand to steady  _  . At that moment, our huge fish got off the fishing line and started to swim  _  I saw teas streaming down Jonathan's face. \"Dad, I'm sorry. I'll never be able to  _  this up to you.\" I reached out and put my hands on his shoulders. I said the following  _  almost without thinking. \"Jon, how did you feel  _  I was reeling that fish in? Were you excited?\" He nodded and said,\"Dad,I've never been so  _  in my whole life!\"I repied, \"Jon, wasn't that about the most fun we've ever had together?\" He nodded his head in  _  . Then I said, \"So, why should we let a fish getting away  _  possibly the best experience we've ever had? Let's be happy about the fun we did have.\" My son,  _  his arms around me, said,\"Dad, I love you so much!\"1  _  him back and said softly into his ear, \"I love you too, Jon.\" We  _  did catch that big fish. But I've known ever since that I didn't let the most important thing get away that day.",
