One summer's day as they were sitting  _  on a bench in the sunshine, one of the men jumped  _  his feet without warning and exclaimed, \"We can't go on  _  this. We've got to do something to  _  some money.\" \"  _  for instance?\" asked his friend in a  _  voice. \"We'll go to the mountains and  _  snails ,\" said the first man. The second man didn't want to go out at first. But in the end his friend  _  him. They each took a bucket and set  _  for the mountains. They walked extremely slowly. When they reached the hill, they looked  as though  it might have a lot of snails on it. The first man said, \"Let's work  _  . I'll go up this side with my bucket, and you go up the other side with  _  , we'll meet at the top.\" They  _  snails all day and in the evening they met on top of the hill. \"How many did you get?\" asked the first man. \"Two,\" said the second man. \"I  _  got three, but one got away.\"",
