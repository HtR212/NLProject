    "article": "One day while sitting in the boat fishing, I noticed a field mouse on the river bank. He ran out of his  _  , ran around a bit and then ran back. I thought of the  _  of this mouse. His life is spent running around,  _  , following his nose. He runs here, runs there, turns in circles, but never really sees much beyond his  _  . He is trying to  _  his way to successful living, which is finding a little  _  , so that he can carry on for the rest of his life, frightened. A few minutes later I looked up and noticed an osprey  _  high in the sky. This keen-eyed hunter with a  _  view of the river was simply waiting for the best time to catch his food. The  _  creature flew up toward a nest at the top of one of the tallest trees. It is the osprey not the field mouse that  _  our human potential . I don't know about you, but it is  _  for me to decide which creature I want to learn from. I want to  _  , to see the big picture, to climb higher, go farther, dive deeper, and  _  more. I want my soul enlarged and my heart inspired. I want to  _  running about following my nose and instead I want to find new strength, fresh  _  , clear vision and courage. I want to be more like the osprey and less like the field mouse, for to live like the field mouse is to ruin my potential.",
