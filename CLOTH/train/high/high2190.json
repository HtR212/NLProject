In fact, he is very obedient to me  _  when I take care of other furry friends in our shelter. As you already know, there have been a lot of forest fires during the  _  season. Many forests are badly  _  by fire each year. Not far from our shelter, a forest caught fire during this hot summer and a heat wave has been going on for three days. Luke rushed towards the forest where flames gave out a fierce heat. There's no longer any  _  at the moment to wait for Luke to come back to the shelter.  In fact  , I was waiting for the fireman to  _  me his death in the forest. Suddenly, a fireman burst into my office and  _  me that my dog Luke succeeded in saving four kittens that were  _  by the flames. According to the fireman, Luke seized the kittens, one by one moving them to a(n)  _  place. I  _  accompanied the firemen to the forest to pick up the rescued kittens. Once on the  _  of the incident, Luke was not there. Then we heard the sound of a dog came from the forest barking furiously. I  _  the sound of my dog Luke. The firemen followed the tracks of the dog  _  they found him barking loudly by the side of a(n)  _  fireman who was lying on the ground and desperately waiting for  _  . Thanks to Luke, four kittens and a fireman were saved. That day, I was very proud of Luke for his heroic  _  . Luke showed much compassion for both animals like him and for a man trying to put out the fire with his  _  . Honestly, my happiness is great and immeasurable. I visited the fireman in his house accompanied with Luke. What a  _  scene when the fireman hugged Luke  _  to his chest! \"One thousand thanks, Luke, for saving my life,\" the fireman said. This true story of love and compassion shows us that pets are loving and caring. We should love and protect them, for little animals can make enormous things for  _  .",
