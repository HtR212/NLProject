    "article": "It was December 2013, and I decided to return to India after spending five years in the US studying.\nI was in the process of  _  and among the items I put up for sale was an old computer. A student agreed to take it for $ 20. I decided to wipe it clean  _  handing it over , but while doing so, a tiny spring    came off  and disappeared somewhere on the floor.\nI put the  _  off for a week and found a small downtown repair shop. The repairman there, a tall gentleman, was kind and helpful. \"It's a  _  job,\" he said, examining the computer. \"We only  _  a small fee.\"\nWhen I returned the next day, I noticed that the spring had been  _  and that the computer was in working order. But I was served a bill for $ 50! I tried to  _  my troubles to the store manager, who although  _  , was unmoved. \"Sorry,\" he said to me, \"I can't break the rules.\"\nHowever, he did suggest a (n)  _  . \"We can undo what the repairman has done,\" he said. \"That way you can take back the computer without having to pay our  _  .\" I agreed, somehow feeling both  _  and disappointment. The repairman removed the spring, then handed the computer back to me.\nI tucked   it under my arm and hurried towards my  _  , eager to forget the whole thing. Just then, in the deserted parking lot, I felt a  _   tap on my shoulder. I turned around to find the tall repairman standing behind me with a  _  .\n\"Hey man, take it easy,\" he told me. \"  _  a spring isn't that difficult. You can do it yourself.\" He then walked back to the store after having  _  two tiny computer springs into my palm.\nI guess he gave me two pieces  in case  I broke or lost the first one while trying to fix it myself. I really wanted to go back to the store to  _  him, but I didn't know what to say or how to say it without getting him in  _  with his employer.",
