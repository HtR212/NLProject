    "article": "\"What are you going to be when you grow up?\" is a question that you may have been asked. You may not even know there are a variety of geography-related jobs. \nThe Association of American Geographers lists nearly 150 different geography jobs. So, if you are interested in people, places, and environments, consider a job in geography. Your work will not be limited to maps--it might range from   _   data to planning projects, or making decisions about the environment.\nProcessing Geographic Data \nA geographer's main activity is analyzing geographic information to answer geographic questions. Jobs processing geographic data begin, of course, with collecting the information. One on-the-ground job in data collection is that of a surveyor. Surveyors   _  and measure the land directly. They may mark boundaries, study the shape of the land, or even help find sewer  and water systems beneath the Earth. High-tech information-gathering jobs include working with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data. Some examples of these jobs include remote sensing specialists and GIS analysts. Data analysis jobs require the ability to think  _  , high-level computer skills, and a college education.\nOnce data have been processed, a geographer may study the information to use in planning projects such as a new urban area, a(n)   _   evacuation  plan, or the placement of a new highway. Planners can also help determine how to make a neighborhood a better place to live. These jobs, too, require good critical thinking, writing, and computer skills, as well as a college education. Planners are 55 _  to the success of a community.\nAdvising Businesses and Government \nAbout half of jobs using geography are in business and government. All kinds of businesses use geographic information to help build and   _   their operations. A location analyst studies an area to find the best location for a client. The client might be a large retail store chain that wants to know which location would be best for opening a new store. The location analyst can study GIS reports on such elements as transportation networks or population in an area and give the business owners the positive and   _   points about a location being considered.\nIn 1967, the Mexican government was looking for a location to create a new international tourist resort. They used location analysts to find an area that had good beaches and was easy to reach from the United States. The   _   was Cancun, today one of the world's most desirable vacation sites. \nBusinesses connected with natural   _   such as forests also rely on geographers. Geographers help them understand the relationship between their business and the environment where their business is located. \nIn 1967, Cancun was a small island on Mexico's Caribbean coast. It had white sand beaches, many birds and mangrove  trees, but few people. After it was selected as a resort site, it was quickly   _  . Today, Cancun has more than 100 hotels and 500,000 permanent residents. Many work in the tourist industry that serves the millions of visitors who come each year from all over the world. \nPhysical and Human Geography\nPhysical geographers are sometimes called earth scientists. Some study such topics as geomorphology  , that is, the study of how the shape of the Earth   _   . Others study weather and climate. Still others study water, the oceans, soils, or ecology. Jobs in these fields require   _   scientific training.\nSome geographers study economic, political, and   _   issues as they relate to place or region. Human geographers are usually hired by government agencies to analyze a specific problem. These geographers work   _   with political scientists, economists, and sociologists. \nTogether, they provide possible solutions to problems from many different aspects of life in an area. And, of course, geographers teach the subject at all levels of   _  , from elementary schools to universities. But no matter what geography jobs people might hold, they are always trying to answer the basic geographic questions: \"Where are things located?\" and \"Why are they there?\"",
