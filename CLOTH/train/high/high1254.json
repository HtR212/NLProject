One weekend, he   _   tomatoes, potatoes and eggplant ---- enough to feed his family for the summer.\nHe ended up with so much   _   that he couldn't give it away.   _   he found a local food   _  , and by the time he delivered his last harvest, he had   _   120 pounds of fresh vegetables.\nThe following year, with a handful of   _   from his church and a memorable name \"America's Grow-a-Row\", Paillex planted,   _  , and harvested 1,500 pounds of vegetables, all of which he donated to food banks. Later he had more volunteers, rent more land and donated more vegetables.\nPailex also   _   local school kids. On a   _   Friday morning in May, 40 third and fifth graders trooped onto a freshly plowed field, each   _   with a spade. Squatting or kneeling in teams of two, they loosened the dirt, then carefully   _   the plants. Several rows later, they eagerly lined up to seed corn under a hot midmorning sun.

When they become tomorrow's   _  , it will be much more possible for them to   _   their coworkers and employees to get   _   in something like this.\n\"Paillex makes people want to   _  ,\" says Colleen Duerr, a mother of two who has signed on as an   _   \"Grow-a-Row\" member. \"And families love this. Pallex has given us a way to raise our kids with a giving heart.\"",
