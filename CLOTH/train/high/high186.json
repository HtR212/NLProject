I started putting out food for him each day, but he wouldn't come near me if other people were  _  . Winter came, and he still wouldn' t  _  us. Then, one day, a car hit him so we took him to the vets. After a week, we were eager to bring him home to  _  our family. But when we went to take the cat home, the vet told us we should put him to  _  immediately because the cat was so fierce and mean that he would  _  become tame, let alone a pet. But I have always had  _  in love's power to  _  even the wildest beasts. I told the vet, \"I want to take him home.\" We  _  him Paws. Three days went by, and we only knew Paws was  _  the bed because when we walked past it we heard deep growling. 1 wanted to somehow let him know he was  _  and loved. So I put on a hard hat and a pair of welding gloves. 1  _  under the bed toward Paws, with my face to the  _  and only the top of my head facing him. 1  _  out to stroke him gently over and over again. He growled and tried to  _  and bite me. It was scary but I knew he couldn't  _  me, so I just kept going. Slowly, he began to  calm down  . Then I slid out from under the bed and left the room. Several hours later. I noticed a cat on the bed. It was Paws all  stretched wit  on the pillows! I couldn't believe it. That dear cat became the  _  of our household. Although Paws finally died of cancer, his legacy -my  _  and firm belief in the power of love lives on.",
