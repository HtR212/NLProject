    "article": "Uncle Bruce has been my most influential role model. I admire him because he has   _  me into the person I am today by teaching me about respect and responsibility and that anything  _  having takes a lot of hard work.\nThe most important thing he has  _  me is how to think. He always says, \"You can learn something from everyone,  even if  it's what not to do.\" He always does what he      _   . If he says, \"I'll pick you up at seven on Thursday,\" it will  _   . Also, Bruce is the kind of person who actually   listens to   you.\nUncle Bruce was in the army for 20 years and went through some terrible   _  , but he hasn't let them affect him   _   . After hearing his stories about alcohol- and drug-related  _  , I have no interest in doing anything that could  _  me or my friends. He is also the only person who truly believes I can  _  it to West Point. He has done everything within his   _  to help me achieve that goal.\nUncle Bruce is my hero he is  _  that I want to be when I'm his age. He is smart, financially   _   , and gives back to his community. There is no way I can  _   him for all he's done. He is the one whose  _   can change the way I look at something. I've never told him that I love him,    _   has he told me, but we love each other and I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm not  _  he's perfect, but I can't imagine   _  without him how that he is here.",
