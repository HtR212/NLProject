    "article": "I was born in a poor family. When I was  _  by Tehran University, I made a(n)  _  for student loans  . It was the first time I had had so much  _  and it felt very good.\nWhen I graduated, I had no  _  , and I had $ 30,000 in debt  . I thought my life was really  _  . In order to pay the bills, I had to look for a job.  _  , I finally got a job. However, after working for a while, I lost all my confidence because I was always  _  myself with my workmates. During that time, I used shopping as a way of  _  negative   feelings. However, after shopping, I was  _  by the large amount of money I had  _  . I became worried again. In order to get rid of   my  _  , I would go out and shop even more.\nOne day, I read a book and realized how  _  my life had become. I began to go through the things I  _  and decided to give some of them to people in  _  . Four days later, to my surprise, I  _  12 bags of things in all. From then on, I started to spend my time enjoying nature, going to the gym or reading.\nAs a  _  shopaholic  , I find that it is a good idea to  _  only with friends or partners who are not shopaholics. Why? Because they can help you  _  your spending. What's more, finding other ways of enjoying your  _  time is also important to  _  the cycle   of using shopping as a way of trying to feel better about yourself.",
