This transition from childhood to adulthood is  _  for some, but rough for others. The most important thing about being a teenager is  _  . When we are teenagers, we would get blamed or even punished for anything wrong we do. It's all not so  _  about being a teenager though. We don't have to have our  _  take us to somewhere we want to go or we couldn't go before. We can have  _  with friends or even alone, which we couldn't have because we were too  _  to know what pleasure is! It's a very enjoyable time of life. During this age, we are old enough to  _  what is good for us, and make decisions without  _  others. But like the saying goes, \"All good things must come to an end, but all bad things can continue  _  .\" During this period, we are having much  _  for our studies. If we don't pass, we won't get jobs, and things will take a turn for the  _  . With the present world economy in  _  , we have to do really, really well in our  _  for a job. Adults say that their  _  is the hardest part of life. But I think the transition from a kid to an adult is much  _  than being already an adult. What we do in our teenage years will  _  what we become and how we lead our life in the future. In conclusion, it is quite  _  that parents put much pressure on an already stressed out teenager. If they realized that, living condition for teenagers would be much better.  _  for the teens ourselves we should get to know what is best for us. What's more, we should understand the right  _  of life we choose at this age can make us happy for the rest of our existence.",
