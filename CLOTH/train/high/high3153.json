    "article": "When I was in seventh grade, I volunteered at a local hospital during the summer. I spent most of the time with Mr Gillespie. I spent many days there   _   his hand and talking to him. He became a close   _   of mine, although he was in a coma .\nI left for a week, and when I came back, Mr Gillespie was   _  . I didn't have the courage to ask any of the nurses where he was, for fear they might tell me he had died. So with many questions   _  , I continued to volunteer there.\nSeveral years later, I was at a gas station when I noticed a   _   face. When I realized who it was, my eyes filled with tears. He was alive! I got the courage to ask him if his name was Mr Gillespie, and if he had been in a coma about five years ago. With an uncertain look on his face, he   _   yes. I explained how I knew him. His eyes welled up with tears, and he gave me the warmest hug.\nHe began to tell me how, as he lay there comatose , he could hear me talking to him and could feel me holding his hand the whole time. He thought it was a(n)   _  , not a person, who was there with him. Mr Gillespie firmly believed that it was my voice and touch that had kept him alive. We both cried for a while, said our good byes and   _   our separate ways.\nI know that I made a   _   between his life and his death. More importantly, he has made a very big difference in my life, too. I will never forget him and what he   _   for me: he made me an angel.",
