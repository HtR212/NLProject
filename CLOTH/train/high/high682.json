Suddenly, I heard an old  _  from my childhood playing on TV. As the  _  music came into the kitchen, I found myself singing a few  _  along with it, and even doing a little dance step or two while I put back the plates. Then I realized that this was the first time I had  _  in a very long while. In the days following my Mother's  _  , I had done my best to  _  again. I had hugged my children and said I loved them. I had  _  the Autumn leaves with their beautiful colors and taken in a few sunsets as well. My heart was still  _  and my moments of joy were few. More than once when I was on the road, passing a(n)  _  bike the one my Mother used to ride for many years my eyes would be full of tears. I missed her so much. It was so  _  not having her here in my life any more. When I found myself dancing  _  even for a second, however, I  _  that I was doing just what my Mother would have wanted me to do. she would be  _  if I felt so sad. She would have wanted me to dance again, to sing again, to smile again, and to laugh again. She would have wanted me to  _  joy again and share it with others. She would have wanted me to LIVE and to LOVE here on Earth while my life  goes on  . And in that moment my heart began to  _  . I promise you Mother that I will continue to heal even  _  you. I will continue to sing. I will continue to dance. I will continue to say \"yes\" to life and to love all the  _  I have left here.",
