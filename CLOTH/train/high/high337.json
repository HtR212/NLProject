    "article": "During the course of a lifetime, we all make mistakes. And, we often take for granted what we have, either thinking we  _  what we already have, or believing we will never need anyone to  _  us.\nSuch was the  _  of Cecilia.\nCecilia had a great job, a nice house and everything she  _  . She was,  _  , not a kind person for several reasons that became  _  once you got to know her. The first thing was her lack of sympathy for others not as  _  as her. She would not express any sympathy for anyone in trouble. Her  _  was that they were just too lazy. But, then came the fateful day. Her husband got into  _  difficulty, to the point where he was  _  to declare bankruptcy. Then she found she was the one who  _  nothing.\nThe tables were completely  _  , and she was desperate for help. She also found her parents were unwilling to help her, but  _  for her, his family were willing and able to help them through those difficult times despite the  _  that she had excluded   them from her life.\nI wish I could give you a beautiful  _  to this story but sadly I cannot. Even though Cecilia was assisted through  _  times, once over, she returned to her  _  self.\nBut this is not the main point of this story. We all need  _  somewhere along life's path whether we think we will or not. And, if you are the one  _  and helping, just remember this: no matter what  _  later, you will always be secure in the fact that you have remained strong and true to assist those that need your help.",
