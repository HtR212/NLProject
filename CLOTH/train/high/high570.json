    "article": "It is Sunday and lunch has, as usual, come to a hurried end.My wife and I are still sitting at the table.My wife likes to be  _  in the life of her child, but I sometimes fear she is in too deep.She has  _  the morning on an online student forum, asking questions about UCAS  on behalf of  Dick. \"A lot of people haven't had any offers yet,\" she says. \"I said I already had one.\" \"Wait,\" Dick says. \"Are you  _  to be me?\" \"No, I have my own login details now,\" she says. \"How do you know he isn't his own mother pretending to be him?\" Dick says. Earlier, when we all sat down to lunch, Dick, who had been to parties the  _  evening, came back. \"Who were there?\" my wife asks Dick. \"What was it like?\" \"It was OK.\" he says. \"Not good enough,\" she says. \"What was the worst thing  that  happened?\" My wife's continued question  meets with  a deepening, boring silence. I start to eat faster. There is a long, highly  _  pause in the conversation. \"So,\" she says  _  , \"was it a kissing party?\" \"Oh my God!\" shouts Dick,  _  his fork. \"What is wrong with you? Why are you like this?\" Surrounded by further scolds, lunch comes to a hurried end. Dick finds himself  _  with clearing up.  For a time  , the running of water and the sound of washing plates are the only sounds in the room. \"  Supposing  at any time you're prepared to apologize for being rude,\" she says, \"you can go and finish watching the football.\" \"Are you joking?\" he shouts. \"No way! Why  _  I apologize to you?\" He pauses to look into the bottom of a pan, and a smile  _  across his face. \"What I mean is, I'm really very sorry,\" he says, dropping the pan into the sink and running from the room. \"Bye!\" \"You don't have to worry,\" my wife says. \"In a  _  's time, you'll be 18 and I won't be able to do this to you any more.\" \"Really?\" he says. \"You'll be a(n)  _  ,\" she says. The boy stops to consider the blue print that after a  _  set seven days from then on, his parents will be  _  to stop ruining his life. He looks both doubtful and a little alarmed. I approaches my wife,whispering to her. \"Dear, I agree with you--understanding and trust may  as well  be a good way to communicate with our teen children.\"",
