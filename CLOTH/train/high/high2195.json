They called to the Marie for  _  but she was far  _  the reach of the human voice. At one o'clock in the morning suddenly some  _  were seen in the distance: another ship! The shouts of the  _  were heard on board, and willing hands pulled them out of the water. The  _  of the ship that had arrived at the scene  in time  to save their lives was Ellen. What had  _  her to the exact spot  _  the darkness and the pathless sea? Her captain had known  _  of the wreck and had, indeed,  _  to sail away from it. But let him speak for himself. \"  Just as  I was forced by the wind to change my course, a small bird flew across the ship once or twice and then flew at my face. I  took no notice  of this until exactly the same thing happened a second time,  _  caused me to think it rather  _  . While I was this  _  , the same bird, for the third time, made its appearance and flew  _  in the same way as before. I was then  _  to change my course back to the original one. I had not gone far  _  I heard a strange voice; and when I tried to  make sure  where they came from, I found I was in the middle of people who had been shipwrecked. I immediately did my best to save them.\"",
