    "article": "I was growing tired of helping the numerous people who lost their way and parked in front of my house. Almost every night I was  _  during a good night's sleep to help someone passing through. Many times I was taken for granted by penniless motorists who did not  _  thank me for the help they received and some even  _  that I didn't do more.\nOne day, a young man with a-week-old beard  _  out of a broken-down automobile. He had no money and no food. He asked if I could give him some work,  _  him gasoline and a meal. I told him that  _  he wanted to work he could cut the grass, but  _  the work wasn't necessary.\nThough sweaty and hungry, he worked hard.  _  working all day, he sat in the shade and rested. I  _  him for his work and gave him  _  money he needed. I then offered him a little extra money for a task particularly well done, but he  _  I never saw him again. He probably  _  I helped him out that day,  _  that is not the way it was. I didn't help him; he helped me. He helped me to  believe in  people again. He helped me to  once again  want to do something for those who are in  _  . I wish I could thank him for restoring some of my faith in the  _  goodness of others and for giving me back a little of the optimism  I had  _  . Because of him, I once again felt part of a golden chain of  _  that binds us to others.\nI  _  have fed his body that day, but he fed my soul.",
