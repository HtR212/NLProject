    "article": "Sports are by nature competitive. But recently, the over-competitive nature youth sports seem to have taken on has led to cause for  _  . Those who are strongly against competition point out that in a competition, only one wins while the rest  _  . They argue that competition leads children to define themselves by the outcome, tying their self-esteem up with their ability to  _  others. They further argue that competition causes anxiety, affects learning and causes children to view others as  _  to their success. Competition restricts participation and  _  success. A \"win-at-all-costs\" mentality can cause children to pay little attention to honesty and fair play. On the opposite side of the debate are those who view competition as a  _  part of American society. They argue that placing kids in a competitive situation such as sports helps prepare them for a(n)  _  life in our society that is full of competition.  _  is a normal part of human nature and part of everyday life. Other arguments  _  competitive sports are that they provide challenges, help kids develop skills, and teach them how to get along with others. The third side of this debate says that a little competition can't be that  _  , as long as competition does not get out of hand and take on a \"win-at-all-costs\" mentality. They claim that competition in itself is not bad and it can serve as a  _  of social comparison, necessary for adolescents to see how  _  they are. Their advice is to introduce competition  _  while focusing more on mastery and cooperation during childhood. The gradual shift toward competition will allow children to build skills, participate fully, and focus on  _  rather than winning. It is important that you consider all of the possible  _  of competition before you put your child in a competitive situation.",
