    "article": "In 1972, I returned to Miami Beach High School to speak to the drama class. Afterward I asked the drama teacher  _  any of my English teachers are still there. Irene Roberts, he tells me, is in the class  _  down the hall. I was no one special in Miss Roberts' class -- just another student who did okay work. I don't recall any one special bit of wisdom she passed on. Yet I cannot forget her  _  for language, for ideas and for her students. I  _  now, many years later, that she is the perfect example of a  _  teacher. I'd like to say something to her, I say, but I don't want to  _  her from a class. Nonsense, he says, she'll be  _  to see you. The drama teacher  _  Miss Roberts into the hallway where stands this 32-year-old man she last saw at 18. \"I'm Mark Medoff,\" I tell her. \"You were my 12th-grade English teacher in 1958.\" She  _  her head to one side and looks at me, as if this angle might remember me in her  _  . And then, though armed with a message I want to  _  in many words, I can't think up anything more memorable than this: \"I want you to know,\" I say, \"you were  _  to me.\" And there in the hallway, this lovely woman, now nearing  _  age, this teacher who doesn't remember me, begins to weep; and she encircles me in her arms.  _  this moment, I begin to sense that everything I will ever know, everything I will ever pass to my students, is an inseparable part of a legacy of our ancestors. Irene Roberts holds me  _  in her arms and through her tears whispers  _  my cheek, \"Thank you.\" And then, with the briefest of looks into my forgotten face, she  _  back into her classroom,  _  to what she has done thousands of days through all the years of my  _  . On reflection, maybe those were,  after all  , just the right words to say to Irene Roberts. Maybe they are the very words I would like to speak to all those teachers through my life, the very words I would like spoken to me one day by some returning student: \"I want you to know you were important to me.\"",
