A screen door allowed the occasional  _  to enter the house and also kept out  _  flies and other insects.\nOne day my mother scolded me for not  _  my lunch and I got mad. I wanted to play outside and not be  _  to finish eating. In my angry motion to  _  the screen door with my foot, I made a 12-inch hole in the corner of the screen door. But I had no  _  , for I was happy to be playing in the backyard with my toys.\nToday, I know if my child had done what I did, I would have scolded him, and told him about how  _  this new screen door was. However, they never said a word. They  _  the corner of the screen door broken, creating an opening, a breach  in the defense  _  unwanted insects.\nFor years, every time I saw the screen door, it would constantly remind myself of my mistake. I knew that everyone in my family would see that hole and  _  who did it. For years, every time I saw a fly buzzing in the kitchen, I would wonder if it came in through the hole that I had created with my angry foot. I would wonder if my family members were thinking about the same thing,  _  blaming me.\nMy parents taught me a valuable lesson, one that stern  words perhaps could not  _  . It has helped me to become a more patient person.",
