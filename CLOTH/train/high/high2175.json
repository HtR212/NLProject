    "article": "In the early 1980s,I interviewed a young man who began to quote  information that agreed with the company he was applying to. He quoted the  _  income figures, the number of employees, and other related information. Needless to say, I was  _  ,so he got the job. Comparing him with the other candidates, I found his  _  of the company was overall and colorful. My impression was that he had  _  much time researching the company. None of his  _  had done so. Months later, I asked him where he'd done his research to  _  so much about our company. He smiled and said,\" Remember our meeting was  _  at 2 p.m. but that day you were running 15 minutes behind?\"I nodded.\"Well,  _  I sat in the reception area waiting for you, I  _  among the magazines on the coffee table was a year-end report. It  _  the company's complete history. Fifteen minutes gave me plenty of time to 'research' the company.\"This story is very  _  although what he did is simple. He only learned more than others in a short time. As a result, he  _  twenty other candidates.\n  _  ,\"Little Things\" can make \"Big Difference\". We need only look at the Olympic athletes. Sometimes the runner who crosses the finish line 1/100th of a second  faster  than the next wins Gold. A gold medal can  _  the difference of millions of dollars. One might ask: Is this gold medal  _  ten times faster or better than the second runner?  No, he is  _  1/100th of a second faster. It  _  much training and practice to become a gold medal winner. How  _  it is to pass all the other athletes!So if we want to be successful, we have to  _  more and practice more.",
