    "article": "One windy spring day, I observed young people having fun using the wind to  _  their kites. Multicolored creations of varying shapes and sizes  _  the sky like beautiful birds darting and  _  . As the strong winds gusted against the kites, a  _  kept them in check.  Instead of  blowing away with the wind, they arose against it to achieve great  _  . They shook and pulled,  _  the control string and the long tail kept them in check, facing upward and against the wind. As the kites  _  and trembled against the string, they seemed to say, \"Let me go! Let me go! I want to be free!\" They flew beautifully even  _  they fought the restriction of the string.  _  , one of the kites succeeded in breaking loose. \"Free at last,\" it seemed to say. \"Free to fly with the wind.\" Yet  _  from restraint simply put it  in the charge of  an unsympathetic breeze. It flew awkwardly to the ground and  _  in a wild mass of weeds and string against a dead bush. \"Free at last\", free to lie powerless in the dirt, to be blown  _  along the ground, and to stuck lifeless against the first barrier. How much like kites we sometimes are. The heaven gives us misfortune and restrictions, rules to  _  from which we can  _  and gain strength. Restraint is a  _  counterpart to the winds of opposition. Some of us resist the rules so hard that we never fly high enough to reach the heights we might have obtained. We obey part of the rules and  _  rise high enough to get our tails off the ground. Let us each rise to the great heights,  _  that some of the restraints that we may be unhappy about are actually the steadying force that helps us  go up  and achieve.",
