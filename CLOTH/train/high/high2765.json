    "article": "One of my patients was an old lady, who had only a few months to live.   _  ,\nshe had never been given a birthday party before. I wanted her to  _  the feeling of a celebration in her honor and  _  her that I would give her a perfect party.\n  _   the party brought her great joy. One particular   _  involved a trip to\nbakery famous for its fine pastries .   _  the woman had heard of\nthis  _  , she'd never gone inside to try its\ngoods because she could not  _  them. When I\nsuggested that we go to the bakery to  _  the\npastries for her party, she got out of her  _  and\nwalked unaided to the door. It was the first time I'd ever seen her walk  _  . When we got to the bakery, she walked in and  _  to\nthe clerk, \"We're having a party!\" Although she was too  _  to do much more than eat the sweets by taking very small bites, she\ndidn't stop  looking around  in total wonderment; no detail of\nthe shop escaped her notice.\nOn the day of the party, she got up   _  and dressed herself in her best suit. Even\nthough there were holes in her suit, she was proud to  _  it.\nBy 7:00 a.m. she positioned herself in her wheelchair and became Queen for the Day.\n  _   a week after the party, this woman who never smiled, because her   _  life\nhad given her little to smile about, smiled widely. \"I guess we can  _  ourselves for the party we had!\" she said. Her joy was the direct\nresult of fulfilling  the very real human need to feel  _  . She died a few weeks\nlater.",
