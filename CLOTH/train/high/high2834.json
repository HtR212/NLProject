Although they carried a big pack of luggage, it seemed to have no other choice, so they decided to climb the  _  up together! When they arrived at the 20 floor, the elder brother  _  putting the luggage there and coming back for it the next day. Feeling much more relaxed, they  _  to climb up. When they  _  to the 40 ,the younger started to complain and  _  of them quarreled till the 60 floor. Arriving there, they were so tired that they didn't have any  _  to quarrel. The younger said,\"Don't quarrel, let's  finish  climbing the stairs.\"And they went on climbing  _  ,finally reaching the 80th!They felt  _  arriving at the door of their home. But soon they found their  _  were kept on the 20th. This story is a reflection on our lives. Many of us live under the  _  of our parents, teachers and friends when young. We seldom get to do the things we love. By the age of twenty,with so much pressure, we get  _  and then decide to throw down this load.  _  from this load, we work energetically with ambitious dreams. But at the age of forty,we discover the youth has already died, so much  _  is produced unavoidably, and begin to feel sorry for that. When you  _  the age of sixty ,we discover life hasn't remained too much, so we tell ourselves not to complain and  _  the remaining days! Upon that we walk silently over our own  _  years of life. Arriving at the  _  of the life, we think there is nothing left to disappoint us, only the  _  that we can't rest in peace. Follow your dream , so you will not live with regrets.",
