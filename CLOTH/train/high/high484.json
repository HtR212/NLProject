Entertainment has become rather passive with  _  , television and computer games becoming more popular. These screen-based methods have had a  _  effect on communication. They prevent children communicating with others.  _  , drama puts the children enthusiastic about communication back into entertainment. Children have the opportunity to  _  with others in a more meaningful way  _  drama encourages speech development , awareness of body language and allows children to become more  _  aware. Play and drama are closely linked. When children play a game, they are using their  _  and moving away from reality to  _  their own story. Drama is a vehicle  _  which children can express themselves more freely to make education fun.

Drama and  education  have a strong link as drama can  _  children to take an active interest in other subjects such as geography, history and English and so they can  _  a more rounded education. As a drama teacher, I have witnessed a child at his first class holding onto his parent's arm----  _  to let go. Then to see the same child running into my class with a smile is an  _  sight.
