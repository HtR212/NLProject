    "article": "Which Method Do You Think Better?\n  By the time that a student reaches his senior year in high school, he is likely to believe that he is an expert in reading. No matter how   _  he is, he can\nstill improve. How do you read an article in a textbook? Do you have a certain  _  of doing it or do you just  _  at the beginning and\nkeep reading  _  you come to the end?\n  _   students say that they use the \" slow and sure\" method. By this they mean they read every sentence slowly and   _  . Every time they come to an  _  word they stop  to think  what it means and, if\nnecessary, look it up in the  _  . In this method a\nperson  _  has no time left for  _  what he has read, for he has used all his  _  in trying to\nget the meaning of each word to  be sure  that he  _  everything.\nOther students use what has been   _  the \"review\" method. Here a person tries to\narrange his time  so that  he can read his lesson  at least  twice. This type of reading is  faster  than the \" slow\nand sure\" method, for the lesson  _  be read rapidly or\nthere will not be  _  time left for a second reading.",
