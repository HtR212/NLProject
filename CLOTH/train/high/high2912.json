    "article": "One of my fondest Christmas memories was also one of our family's bleakest .We were just little kids , and on Christmas Day mom  _  us all around her to tell us ,  in tears  ,that there would be no presents because all we really wanted was to  _  for our daddy.He was very sick . I don't remember anything else except four little girls surrounding my mother, crying  _  a miracle At that very moment ,someone  _  loudly on the door.  _  Behind him was a merry group of soldiers from the Army base where my father  _  as a minister . News had  _  that we were in trouble ,and his colleagues knew we needed some  _  . With all the excitement ,even my dad  _  in a blanket to keep warm , came down and sat in front of a roaring fire in our room to watch his children be  _  by good Samaritants . The presents were unwrapped , and we girls  _  packages and found a doll each and four board games. What is  _  to me is that I don't even remember what sickness my father was suffering from.I  _  remember an evening of laughter and  _  There were no expensive toys but  _  moments of friendship and fun given by young men who knew that a family was having a(n)  _  time . They gave their time and their  _  to little children who needed to laugh. The most important thing in life aren't things . And what about the true  _  of holidays ? I hope we all are able to remember a thing about the holidays that stirs our heart , that isn't really a thing at all, but the smile on a child's face because we take a moment to hug or  wipe away  a tear.",
