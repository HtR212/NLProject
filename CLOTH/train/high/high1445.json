    "article": "Three years ago, I had a job in a retail store . I  _  to talk to everybody and know what was going on in their  _  . I remember a girl who started  _  there a few months after me. We seldom talked but we always  looked at  each other and smiled. She always smiled in a really happy way  _  one day when we got to work in the  _  department. She smiled as if she was the  _  girl in the world. I went up to her and asked, \"What's wrong with you?\" She answered, \"Why?\" I said, \"I could feel you're very  _  , but you're always trying to  _  it.\" Her mouth just dropped as if I had  _  her deepest secret, so we started talking. She told me  _  she was feeling unhappy and why she was trying to  _  that nothing was wrong. Time went by and we became good friends. She'd always tell me I had  _  her life in so many ways. Today that girl is one of my best  _  . I really don't know what I would do  _  her. She has been there for me in every  _  way a friend could be. What I'm trying to say is that you never know  _  you're helping yourself. I helped this girl never knowing that at the same time I was helping myself by finding a  _  friend. So the next time you see a  _  and he needs someone who will  _  to him, wait and let him say what he wants to say. You never know, you might just end up helping yourself.",
