    "article": "People often ask me how I write with four children. \nMore often than not, my stories are pieced together, written, and edited in a series of   _   moments. If I'm working while the kids are home, I have the added    _   of tuning out their chaos. I'll write and write until I fall under a spell, and just when I was getting    _  , it happens--Camille will   _   into my office wearing a big smile--and a smelling diaper  .\nI wish I had a daily   _  , a solid time no one can interrupt, but I don't. I may go days or even weeks without writing. I hate these   _  , but much as I like to believe the world needs my writing, my daughters need me much more. So for now I write when I can. While this arrangement works, I sometimes   _   how productive I'd be if my life wasn't stop-and-go. With time on my side, I could be a writing machine,   _   at once what would normally take me months.  \nThis leads me to a question I find   _   to all parents: Do kids hold back or   _   our dreams? Children are needy by nature, and regardless of how much   _   we show them, they want more. By the time we tend to them, we're tired out--and 47 _  in the mood to follow our dream. They push our personal pleasures   _   and slow us down, making tortoises out of hares. \nOn the other hand, children add a richness to our lives that I believe inspires better work, thus    _   for time we lose. As a writer, I don't find inspiration sitting at my computer.   _  , I find it when I'm out living, and the   _   I take because of my children--going to the ballpark, birthday parties, even doctor visits--put me in   _   with people who constantly set off new ideas. Many ideas arise through   _   conversation, which can   _   me like thunder. Immediately, I'll make a mental note, knowing that someday I'll use that 55 _  in a story.",
