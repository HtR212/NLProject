    "article": "There was a Greek shopkeeper in a small corner shop in London. She taught me about the  _  of an act of kindness, which has motivated me to give. On the day I went to that shop, I was  _  with a very high fever. I had been off work for days and I had  _  out of food. Because I had been working so hard since I had  _  to town, I also had no friends who could help. So I went out to get some food.  _  , I would have gone to the supermarket, but on this  _  , I went into the Greek shop because it was closer. I  picked up  a few things, which revealed the  _  that I lived alone. Then I  _  them to the shopkeeper, who told me, \"You are unwell.\" I  _  rather shyly. She pointed at the things I was buying and  _  \"I can make you a sandwich, so you don't have to do it yourself.\" So, she made the sandwich and asked me to  _  a moment. She went in the back room and reappeared with a container of hot soup.\" It will  _  you up,\" she said with a smile. What really warmed me up,  _  , was not the soup. It was her  _  that told me she cared. Her kindness made me feel cared for when I was particularly  _  . And it  _  me. It made me want to be as  _  as the shopkeeper. I had been quite shy, but, from that day on, I did not let shyness prevent me from  _  random acts of kindness. I was determined to  _  the joy... and I haven't felt lonely since!",
