    "article": "Optimism and pessimism are both powerful forces. Each of us must choose which we want to  _  our future and our expectations. We can choose to laugh or cry, bless or  _  . It's our decision: From which perspective do we want to view life? Will we look up in  _  or down in desperation? I believe in the upward look. I choose to  _  the positive and skip right over the negative. An optimistic attitude is not a luxury; it's a(n)  _  . The way you look at life will determine how you feel, how you perform, and how well you will get along with other people.  _  , negative thoughts, attitudes, and expectations  feed on  themselves; they become a self-fulfilling prophecy . Pessimism creates a dark place where no one wants to live. Years ago, I drove into a service station to get some gas. It was a beautiful day, and I was feeling great. As I walked into the station to pay for the gas, the attendant said to me, \"How do you feel?\" That seemed like a(n)  _  question, but I felt fine and told him so. \"You don't look well,\" he replied. This  _  me completely by surprise. A little  _  confidently, I told him that I had  _  felt better. Without hesitation, he continued to tell me how bad I looked and that my skin appeared yellow. By the time I left the service station, I was feeling a little  _  . About a block away, I  _  over to the side of the road to look at my face in the mirror. How did I feel? Was I affected with jaundice ? Was everything all right? By the time I got home, I was beginning to feel a little nauseous . Did I have a bad liver? Had I  picked up  some rare disease? On another beautiful day, when I went into that gas station, feeling  _  again, I figured out what had happened. The place had recently been painted a bright, distasteful  _  , and the light reflecting  _  the walls made everyone inside look as though they had hepatitis ! I wondered how many other folks had  _  the way I did. I had let one short conversation with a total  _  change my attitude for an entire day. He told me I looked sick, and before long, I was actually feeling sick. That single  _  observation had a great effect on the way I felt and acted. The only thing more powerful than negativism is a word of optimism and hope. When a whole culture adopts an upward look, incredible things can be accomplished.",
