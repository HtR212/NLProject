    "article": "John, a famous musician, took his priceless old guitar and played it in the crowded subway station. The music was wonderfully streaming throughout the whole  _  . However, during the one-hour play, only six or seven people were truly  _  the charming music. A three-year-old kid was fully  _  in the music that he forget everything around. John  _  got 52 U.S. dollars for his work that day. However, in  _  days, when John is about to hold a  _  , one ticket can be sold at more than 100 dollars and it is very  _  to buy a ticket even at such a high price. Therefore, later, many  _  in the station that day felt deeply regretful for not  _  the famous musician and missing such a valuable but  _  music feast. I have a rich friend whose wife had a  _  illness. Nevertheless, his wife did not manage to conquer the illness and  passed away  soon. He often sighed miserably that due to his past  _  life, he had missed a lot of beautiful time with his wife. But now, it is impossible to  make up for  it. It is no  _  crying over spilt milk. We have missed a lot of precious things in our life  _  knowing to value them. Actually, I also missed something precious before. The  _  why we would have missed those precious things is less than simple: we had  _  that we could still own them tomorrow. Nevertheless, tomorrow is  _  by no means reliable. The result is that they were always too late to cherish what they had before they  _  it. However, when we reach the condition we have expected, we could no longer realize our wish any more, because we have lost it by then.",
