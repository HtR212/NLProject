    "article": "One day, I went to my favorite cafe for lunch. I   _   a burger and went to the outdoor seats. While waiting for my meal, a homeless man on a bicycle stopped to ask if there was a grocery store nearby. After I gave him   _  , he asked if I had   _   from Santa Clara University. (I was wearing a SCU T-shirt. )I told him, yes. Little did I know that this   _   response would lead to a 90-minute conversation. The man, Michael, told me he was very intelligent.   _  , drug use had ruined both his formal education and his pursuit of   _   in his work. He drifted from one topic to another,   _   the fact that I was ready for my lunch.\nHe clearly had more of a   _   to talk than I did. I made ever   _   to give him my full attention, never   _   our talk would go on and on...Eventually, I did eat my meal, bite by bite   _   responses in our conversation. Michael was a bit strange.   in terms of   his interests and viewpoints. We had little in   _  , but he was fascinated with talking with, as he   _   it, \"intelligent people.\" I have to admit, I wish our conversation had been   _   to ten or fifteen minutes, but when Michael finally   _   off, he thanked me for listening so   _   to him and for my   _   to talk with him for so long. It was then that I   _   that, just maybe, that was my purpose in life for today ...to be there, in that place, at that time, to   _   in that conversation.",
