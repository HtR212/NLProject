    "article": "As we know, it is important to be honest with children. But there are some things in this world that simply aren't  _  . Sometimes it makes sense for parents to  _  to their children.\nI still remember my three-year-old daughter's face when we watched the  _  that twenty children at Sandy Hook Elementary School had been killed. After a few minutes she  reached up  and put her  _  arms around my legs and said, \"I love you, Momma.\" I was still  _  whether or not to turn the TV off when she,  in puzzlement  , asked, \"Momma, why aren't those kids OK?\" I just  _  that they were smart children,  _  they did something wrong and got punished.\nWe're not all  _  of a little lie here and there. Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and Snow White are just a few examples of  _  for parents to keep magic in the world. Magic, imagination and creativity are very essential in life,  _  for children. These stories battle against the negative aspects of the world and create  _  . In the end children will be able to  _  what is true and what was made to  _  their lives. Out of five brothers and a sister I can happily report that not one of the children I grew up with was  _  when we discovered who all those  _  people really were.\nIn life, a parent is the  _  of knowledge, and it is up to the parent to decide what knowledge to teach and when. There's no  _  to tell children all about the truth. As they become  _  , they will have a better understanding of the world.",
