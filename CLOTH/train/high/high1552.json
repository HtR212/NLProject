The Quicksilver Invitation surfing competition had to be   _  . The waves were just too big. \n  But on that same late-January day,  ly unknown big-wave rider Greg Russ had to be physically   _   by lifeguards from launching out into the biggest surf in more than a decade. The guards were interfering with his right to make   _  , he said. \n  The incentive: $50,000 from the surf-equipment manufacturer K2 to anyone who can ride the biggest wave of the year and get it   on film  .\n  From ice climbing to mountain biking to big-wave surfing, more people are becoming extreme athletes, putting their lives in danger for the   _   thrill. But the K2 contest, and the growing popularity of extreme sports worldwide, has   _   questions about the financial and human consequence for athletes and rescuers who watch over them. For many, the incident at Waimea perfectly   _   the dangers unleashed when big money, big egos, and big challenges are mixed.\n  Although exact figures on how many extreme athletes exist are hard to come by, isolated statistical evidence   points to   a rapid increase. For example, the number of climbers   _   to climb Alaska's 20,300-foot Mt. McKinley ---the tallest peak in North America---increased from 695 in 1984 to 1100 in 1997.\n  \"It's a numbers deal, and clearly there are more people getting hurt than there were when I started doing  _   20 years ago,\" says Dan Burnett, a mission coordinator with the all-volunteer Summit County Search and Rescue Group in Colorado. \"We're responding in areas now that even four years ago I would have thought we didn't need to check because   _  goes there.\"\n  Some efforts have been made toward creating a(n)   _   extreme-sports world. Three years ago, Denali National Park in Alaska,   for instance  , instituted a mandatory $ 150 fee for climbers seeking to ascend Mt. McKinley. The fee pays for an educational program that park rangers credit with dramatically   _   the number of search-and-rescue missions and fatalities.",
