    "article": "In families with two working parents, fathers may have more impact   _  a child's language development than mothers, a new study.  _  Researchers  _  92 families from 11 child care centers before their children were a year old, interviewing each to establish income,   _  of education and child care arrangements.   Overall  , it was a group of well-educated middle-class families,   _  married parents both living in the home.\nWhen the children were 2, researchers videotaped them at home in free-play sessions with both parents, recording all of their   _  . The study will appear in the November   _   of The Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology.\nThe scientists  _   the total number of utterances of the parents, the number of different words they used, the   _  of their sentences and other aspects of their speech.   _  average, fathers spoke less than mothers did, but they did not   _  in the length of utterances or proportion of questions asked.\nFinally, the researchers  _  the children's speech at age 3, using a standardized language test. The only predictors of high  _  on the test were the mother's level of education, the  _  of child care and the number of different words the father used.\nThe researchers are  _  why the father's speech, and not the mother's, had an effect. \"It's well  _  that the mother's language does have an impact,\" said Nadya Pancsofar, the lead author of the study. \"It   could  be that the high-functioning mothers in the study had already had a strong influence  _  their children's speech development, or it may be that mothers are  _  in a way we didn't measure in the study.\"",
