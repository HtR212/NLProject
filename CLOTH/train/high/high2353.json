    "article": "A Person Who Has Influenced My Life\nThere is always a time in one's life when a hero comes along. Someone who has inspired you can really help you learn what life is about.\nI   _   it as if it was yesterday. I was fifteen years old that year. It was around eight o'clock one evening when my mother   _   a phone call from her brother-in-law, who told us my aunt was in hospital and that the doctor   _   them she would need an operation immediately. My family became very   _   about my aunt's situation.\nWhile my aunt was in the hospital with special   _  , my cousin Mark, who is mentally disabled, spent time with my family. Mark was seventeen at the time, and had been born with severe mental disorders, which   _   a wide range of social and physical problems for him throughout everyday life. He never had any true friend   _   no one could relate to him. I must   _   that at the beginning I was filled with uncertainty as to how much of a   _   my cousin would bring on my family. Now looking back it saddens me to see the   _   I once showed.\nOver the two weeks when Mark lived with my family, I probably   _   more about life and its meanings. Thinking back, I took   _   in daily life for granted, believing it would always be there. I never even thought about being able to do things like walking, brushing my teeth, or going to the bathroom on my own. Now I see how   _   I am to be able to do these things independently.\nMark was seventeen, but learned on a nine-year-old   _  . Although his learning ability was slower than most, he could still learn. He explored   _   to do most of the things everyone else did.   _   he did pretty well and succeeded in almost everything he tried to do. He   _   his illness and showed an ambition to love life. To him, having a successful life means achieving goals on his own terms and at his own   _  .\nMark is my hero, for his disability has forever   _   my viewpoint on life. It seems like a well-deserved life when you're fifteen, and it is amazing how in a period of time your point of view can change so   _  .",
