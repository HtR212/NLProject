    "article": "A person's home is as much a reflection of his personality as the clothes he wears, the food he eats and the friends with whom he spends his time. Depending on personality, most have in mind a(n) \"  _  home\". But in general, and especially for the student or new wage earners, there are practical  _  of cash and location on achieving that idea. Cash  _  , in fact, often means that the only way of  getting by  when you leave school is to stay at home for a while until things  _  financially. There are obvious  _  of living at home--personal laundry is usually  _  done along with the family wash; meals are provided and there will be a well-established circle of friends to  call on  . And there is  _  the responsibility for paying bills, rates, etc. On the other hand,  _  depends on how a family gets on. Do your parents like your friends? You may love your family--  _  do you like them? Are you prepared to be  _  when your parents ask where you are going in the evening and what time you expect to be back? If you find that you cannot strike a(n)  _  , and that you finally have the money to leave, how do you  _  finding somewhere else to live? If you plan to stay in your home area, the possibilities are  _  well-known to you already. Friends and the local paper are always  anaccessto information  . If you are going to work in a  _  area, again there are the papers--and the accommodation agencies,  _  these should be approached with  _  . Agencies are allowed to charge a fee, usually the  _  of the first week's rent, if you take accommodation they have found for you.",
