Since I was only 16, I really started feeling hopeless in life   _   I didn't know what I was going to do. I worked to help my  _   pay bills and that was all I could do at the time. Then she started telling me that when I turned 18 I had to    get out of  the house.\n  I couldn't understand what was going on because my brother was   _    than me and she didn't want to   _   him out. As my 18th birthday was coming I was really beginning to feel    _   because I didn't have an idea on what to do.\nOne night while I was   _   television, an advertisement came on about joining the Navy. The next day I called the   _   on the advertisement and set up an appointment to meet the recruiter  . When he    _   about me not having a high school diploma he knew I had a  _   chance. I explained to him that I was going to be homeless in a few   _  . He told me he would    _  what he could do. About two months later he called me and   _   me to come to his office. I went in and he   _   to me he would have to pull some strings   to get me in the service   _   I had to promise him that I would make the best of this opportunity he was trying to   _   for me and I did.\n  Now I have a high   _   in life that many people don't have and an ability to make my life a little  _   with that decision I made and the help I received.",
