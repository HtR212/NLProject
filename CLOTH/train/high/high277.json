    "article": "Stacy had recently moved from New York City to Stoneybrook, Connecticut. It was   _   for her to make new friends but she finally had three when she joined the Babysitters Club to   take care of   little children whose parents were busy. Claudia, Kristy, and Mary were in her class at school and also the other   _   of the club. The girls met at five o'clock on Fridays and waited for the   _   to ring. So far they had been busy, in spite of the   _   that they couldn't stay out late and were under 13.\n  _  , the girls' world was invaded by a second group   _   themselves the Babysitters Agency. They were   _   and the group also included a few boys. The Babysitters Club tried to think of ways to   _   with the older group. They could clean and work for less money, however, they   _   it would be difficult to compete. The shock was even greater than they had   _   when most of their best customers started to call the new group. They   _   to get only a few jobs.\nTo try a new   _   Kristy recruited a few older kids who told the club they didn't want to   _   their money with the other group. The club   found out   only too quickly that these older girls joined only as spies and didn't   show up   for their job assignments . Thus, more parents were   _   with the club.\nFinally, the girls realized that the   _   in the other group were not good babysitters. They watched television, talked on the phone, and invited boyfriends to the house   _   they were sitting. When the children of the families started to   _  , and a near accident almost occurred, the club went to the parents to tell them what was happening.",
