    "article": "Learning experiences happen to us throughout our lives. Not long ago, I had one that I would like to   _  .\nI was going to Marblehead with my sailboat team. The team was racing down the highway at 85 miles per hour   _  we realized we were  _  . Luckily, we saw a\nrest area ahead. I had anew $20 bill. I was so   _  because I had never had that kind of\ncash   before. But spending it on  _  seemed like throwing it away. We all rushed into the pizza line.  _  I got a pizza and a drink, and walked to my\ntable. About halfway through the meal, I  _  I\nhad not actually handed any money to the cashier. I had just  _  out, and nobody had noticed. I felt terrible.\nMy conscience opened its mouth and swallowed   me in one big bite. I couldn't   _  over it. I just couldn't go back to the cashier and   _  for my\nstolen pizza. I was so upset that I  _  to\ngive myself the pleasure of an ice cream in  _  that\nsomeone would say,\" Hey, Jeff, why don't you use the change  _  the\npizza instead of that nice, new $20 bill?\" I was not so  _  of my cash now.\nFor the next two years, whenever I was 55 _  of the \"pizza incident\", I would say to myself, \"Don't think about it....\"\nI have learned two things from this  _  .Maybe I was a fool for  _  in to my\nconscience, and being too stupid to enjoy a  _  pizza.\nBut the real lesson is that even if you get away from what you have done, your\nconscience will  _  up with you.\nThis reflects the saying, \"A coward  dies a thousand deaths; a hero dies once.\" I was a coward and have felt terrible about that incident at least a thousand times. If I had been a \"  _  \" and gone back to pay for the pizza, I\nwould have felt a little uncomfortable about it only once, or maybe twice.",
