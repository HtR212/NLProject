Have you ever  _  what that little thought would have become if you had acted on your instincts    _  if you had paid more attention to it?\nImagine a  _  , where you are sitting at home watching television or reading a book, suddenly a light is  _  on in the dark tunnel of your mind as a thought or an idea crosses your mind. The thought  _  your attention but seems so meaningless and you are tempted to  _  it, but wait a minute! That thought could be the potential beginning of the  _  you have so much wished for.\nAs the thought crosses your mind, your senses become alert and you suddenly see a possibility, a solution, or find the answer to a problem whose solution has  _  escaped you. It is almost as if a wise man has  _  the perfect solution into your ear or awakened your senses to a reality, thereby bringing light to your life. It is like finding the  _  piece of jigsaw puzzle  . This becomes an amazing moment and everything freezes around you as you excitedly try to grasp the practicality of that  _  but powerful thought.\nYour self-confidence and enthusiasm increase as you become  _  of the great possibilities that can  _  if that little thought is acted upon. This becomes the moment to build upon that thought and to put  _  any ideas that are streaming from that little thought for later review.  _  meaningless little thought or ideas when acted  _  have a potential to explode into great projects. Many successful projects have been  _  from the little positive thoughts that were carefully protected and recognized as bricks to great things.\nDon't waste a(n)  _  to act on a potentially brilliant idea. You don't have to wait for a major idea, or approval from your peers in order for you to act on that little thought.\nThat little thought or idea is the  _  of great things if you decide to follow it through.",
