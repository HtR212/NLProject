Fishing was his hobby, but I  _  went fishing. We walked a little way along the beach and reached a rock by the shore, and I  _  the hook into the sea from there. Frankly speaking, I am a (n)  _  person, and although I had not felt a tug on the line, I reeled up the hook after five minutes or so. I had caught  _  . It was a starfish.

The girl picked up the starfish and gently put it into the sea, and she  _  at me and said, \"Thank you, sir.\" Many people like \"cute\" creatures such as dogs, cats, and rabbits, while they tend to dislike \"ugly\" creatures such as snakes, spiders, and starfish.
