    "article": "There was a time when I couldn't understand why my parents were so enthusiastic about  _  with my head teacher. I often thought that they were really good at getting me into trouble. But, after my head teacher's home-visit last month, my mind totally  _  \n  _  the visit, I was entirely overwhelmed  by frustration because I thought my head teacher, who , in my eyes,is a  _  boring and strict man, would severely  _  me and ask my parents to take away my iPad. I even wondered if it had been my parents who invited him to come,  so that  I got into argument with my parents.\nWhat was worse, after I  _  the news on my microblog, all the  _  words from my classmates, like \"you are such a lucky dog\" almost tore me apart. When the day  _  came, I said to  myself  , \"It's going to be okay! Just face it!\" To my  _  during his visit, I quickly learned that my head teacher is just a(n)  _  man outside class. With his son and wife accompanying him, he just seemed to be a loving  _  and considerate husband.\nI also learned that he is a man full of  _  . When my sister started licking   her  _  after finishing a delicious dish, he joked that she was trying to turn her plate into a mirror. All of us burst into  _  at that moment.\nContrary to my previous impression, I  found out  that my head teacher is a very respectable and friendly person. Thanks to his visit, I got to see a(n)  _  side of my head teacher. I felt  _  that I had reacted so crazily before. Now, I'm delighted to have him as my head teacher. I know I won't  _  him down.",
