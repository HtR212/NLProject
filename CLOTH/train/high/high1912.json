    "article": "A few years ago, I started therapy  . I kept it a secret   _   it felt like it wasn't the kind of thing I could tell anyone. I felt it was   _  , and I was ashamed of it.   _   I felt I was the only one. It seemed that everyone but me was able to   _   things on their own.   _   of my friends or family needed help like that. But on an occasion, I   let out   my secret to one of my good friends.\n              Guess what   _  ? As I started letting other people know that I was in therapy, some of them started telling me the   _   thing! It seemed that once I told them that I would understand their   _  , it was safe to tell me. We didn't have to keep this a(n)   _   from each other any more.\n              One friend close to me   _   that she went on antidepressants  after her mother's death. Another friend has been   _   for being blue   _   he was in college. My hairdresser had been on medication   because of   obsessive compulsive disorder  . All of them said they felt comfortable to be able to   _   the information. I felt like I found support in my   _   and I wasn't alone, just from   _   their stories. \nIt has made me realize that none of us are   _  . Also, there's no   _   in trying to hide them when you are having   _  . It's better to be open and honest.",
