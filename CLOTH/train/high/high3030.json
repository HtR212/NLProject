    "article": "Ban the Band ?\nEvery year, our school has a dance for all the students. It's a little funny seeing friends in clean shoes and trousers or color1ful   _  , instead of the usual school uniform.\nMost of us think the dance is great   _   ---even the teachers enjoy being there.   _  , two weeks ago someone said that there would be no   _   band this year ---only CDs.\n\"I don't   _   it!\" Amy cried out during the lunch break.. \"Someone said the school couldn't   _   a band, and they think it's too noisy anyway,\"  added Daniel.\n\"Well, I don't think it's   _   enough without a band!\" declared Angela.\" and I'm going to see what can be done.\" \nAngela was as good as her   _  . In the afternoon she went to see the school headmaster who agreed to give the   _   some more thought. And he suggested that one   _  for having a band was to increase the price of each ticket from $5 to $10. Angela had to   _   out whether the students would like to do that.\n\"I need all of you to help me,\"  she   _  to our group before school the next day.\" Mr. Berry gave me a list of all the names, and suggested we ask each one their   _   about the band and the extra cost.\" \n  _   the day we asked around as Angela suggested, and wrote down people's feelings about the band and the cost. We were amazed how much   _   there was for the band and everyone agreed to pay the extra $5.\"I'm surprised,\"  smiled Mr. Berry, when we gave him the   _  .\" I really thought that only a few people   _   their band and that the cost would be too high. OK. Angela, your next   _  is to find a good band and line them up for the dance.\" Angela was all smiles and   _   the news to Amy and Daniel.\" You're   _  ,\" smiled Daniel to Angela as he thought how close they came to having a less than perfect dance.",
