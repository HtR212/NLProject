    "article": "Many of my friends meet on Wednesday in the early morning to go to a specific parking lot sale. We  _  it because we can put whatever fits into the shopping bag  _  just $1.\nOne day as we finished, paid our dollars, and stayed to talk a bit, we noticed the  _  that remained was being thrown into their dustbin. We asked  _  , and they said they had no room for the extra clothes and it would  _  up very quickly. I asked them why they had not  _  in touch with places like churches and  _  for women and children. They said they  _  several times in the past and they only came two or three times and  _  as they had to be there at a specific time in the  _  right after the parking lot sale. After coming a few times, most of these organizations quit.\nAs we are here all the time, we  _  to take the remainder of what was left. They  _  ! So we loaded our two cars full and drove it to our city. We have done this every  _  now for two years! We held yard sales and flea markets for whoever  _  clothing. We opened up a clothing closet called Gifts Of Grace  _  a storage facility donated two units to us.\nNow we have a real building and advertise  _  clothing for anyone who has the need. We have served hundreds of  _  in the tight economy so far with the clothing they were just going to  throw away  . Now our community is better because of it and our lives are blessed. Their lives are made a bit  _  to have this opportunity to find nice clothing for not any penny.\nWe volunteer and run it about two or three days a  _  . One person's trash is always another person's treasure!",
