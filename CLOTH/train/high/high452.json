But the reason why they were together for 11 years before they got  _  is that Hari was afraid of telling her  _  about the person that she'd fallen in love with. She was afraid of the consequences it would  _  for her younger sisters. Would they be packed off to India? Would they end up in arranged  _  they may not want? At 22 years old, when she first fell in love with him -- it was a large burden to  _  . But she loved him, and  _  they moved in together... and then bought a house by the Brighton coast, where they have  _  for almost 8 years. All the while her parents didn't know. Her sisters did, and they too loved Joseph -- they  _  him as the brother they'd never had. But after nine years together, she finally had to tell her father (her mother  _  away a few years ago).
