    "article": "All through high school, students dream of McDonald' s for lunch instead of school lunches.   _  , they don't have that opportunity here. They have to   _  what the school has provided for them. In my opinion, they deserve to have lunches outside of the school.\nBy   _  teens to spend lunchtime outside, the school could save a lot of money, which could be used to   _   more school programs. As we know, school lunches are subsidized by the government. That's why food in school is sold   _  . If students are able to go outside at noon, the school will spend less money on the   _  program. And the school can use the money saved for   _  things, such as sports equipment or new books.\nIf students are able to have lunch outside of the school, they will get more   _  about how the real world works. If they stand in a cafeteria line every day, they won't have the   _   to get involved in wider society. Students,   _   those who are about to graduate, need to know what to expect when they're on their own. Eating outside makes it possible for them to   _  more of the outside world.\nIt is   _   for the school to place more trust in teens. They should be trusted enough to eat out and   _  on time. School officials argue that they're making sure children are   _  by keeping them in school since they're worried that something   _  might happen to children. Of course, lunch rush can be   _  , especially if teens race outside and back to school at the expected time. But the students are now   _  enough to be responsible for their own behavior. All teens have been taught to   _  road rules when they are outside alone.\n  In short  , the school should let students go outside for lunch. It gives students a sense of   _  and responsibility, and they deserve to be trusted.",
