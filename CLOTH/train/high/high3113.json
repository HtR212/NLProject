    "article": "Several years ago, my son and I had a brief conversation that has really stuck with me.\nMy Son: \" Were you there for the first  _  of my game, Dad? I started!\"\nMe: \" I didn't get back into town and to the game  _  the second quarter... But you did great!\"\nMy Son: \"Oh.\"\nMe: \" But you really need to start  _  better.\"\nMy Son:(Silence)\nSo, what was wrong with  _  I said? Well, he understood my flight was late and so I  _  the first quarter. And my compliment  was good. But, the \"but \" was the  _  . Instead of just praising him for his accomplishment, I  _  him for his eating habits. And that criticism crushed  the compliment.\n  Looking back  , I realize that the words I had spoken weren't the  _  words my son heard. The moment I said, \" But you really need...\" what my son heard was, \" What you did was good, but not quite good enough.\"\nSo what did I take away from this  _  ? First, I learned that accomplishments should be strong and  _  . Saying \"great job\" or \"good work\" is a good  _  when complimenting. But it's even  _  to say something like, \"I'm proud that you  _  the staring team. You preserved and worked really hard to get there.\" Second, I learned that criticism should not be  mixed with  a compliment. Criticism can be so  _  to the listener that he won't even hear a compliment more than criticize. Mark Twain once said, \" I can live for two months  _  a good compliment.\" Giving your child a strong compliment can greatly  _  and push him forward. Criticizing your child, although necessary at times,  _  quickly take the wind out of his  _  .",
