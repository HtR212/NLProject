Even  _  .That's the message from Blue Cross Blue Shield.The  _  ,called \"Future You\",uses a digital camera and computer to compare a person's current image with his or her future  _  without changes in bad habits. \"Smoking can  _  your skin,\" said Anna,a creative operation manager,\"You can see what the results of the toxins and the chemicals in  _  are.\" Along with the potentially  _  sight of one's older self,Future You offers sciencebased  _  on what to eat,how much to exercise and other ways to  _  your health.But will it work? Too  _  to tell was the verdict of Anna.\"I want to see some data!\" she said. Generally,Anna said,men show  _  concern about their appearance than women.\"Women say,'That looks like my  _  on the screen,'\" she said.\"Men are more likely to  _  ,'Yeah,go ahead.Put it on Facebook.'\" The project was raised more than a year ago to improve the overall health of the people who are  _  of this company.In addition,the growth in the ranks of  _  customers would bring down the overall cost of health care.In coming weeks,two new ones will be  showing up  in locations such as the American Tobacco Campus and the Museum of Natural Science.If users  _  ,their information will be stored as secrets without names to create a database of good and bad  _  . The process is free and the response is not  _  ,at least according to Valencia Robertson,one of a line of people who waited to  _  the instrument on Thursday.\"I'm good,\" Robertson said after  _  her future image.\"It's not going to be a big difference.\"",
