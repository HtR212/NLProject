    "article": "Just before Christmas 1978, Kenneth was a passenger in a car as it drove through the Navajo Nation. The night was dark, and the driver, an elderly woman, 41 _  and killed an eight-year-old boy.\n              Later, when he saw how sad the boy's family were, Kenneth made a(n)   _  . He would \"do   _   it takes to make   children   happy at Christmas time.\"\n              A year later, at the age of 18, he was living with his mother and younger brother. They were   _   making ends meet on his low wages, but Kenneth bought a used Santa suit and went around   _   people as poor as himself to give candy and fruit to families even more needy.\n              Just before midnight on Christmas Eve, he went knocking on doors of   _   houses in the poorest section of the Navajo Nation. Many of the darkened homes didn't have   _  .\n              Some families were   _   to open their doors so late at night. \"It's a man! He has a big bag!\" he 50 _  a boy, holding up a lantern and watching   from behind   the curtains, tell his parents. Kenneth convinced them he was   _  .\n              At every opened door, he   handed out   candies, oranges, toys and so on. Many Navajo kids had never seen   Santa Claus   before, so his old costume and store-bought beard didn't   _   them. It touched Kenneth that the kids were excited by so   _  .\n              He   _   it up year after year, gathering more \"elves\"   to help him. His Christmas Eve   _    have grown into an annual Navajo feast with gifts of clothing, tools and toys for over 700 people. Kids who can't   _   it to the event because they're sick or lack transportation get a   _   visit from Kenneth or one of his elves.\n              \"My grandfather taught me that you learn to be a man by sharing and by keeping promises,\" he says.",
