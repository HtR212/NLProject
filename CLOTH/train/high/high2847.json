The lawyer was very  _  , after having a chat with them, he got their  _  . They hung on because of their children, afraid that it might  _  their growth. Now, all they wanted was to lead their own life free from all these years of  _  from their marriage, so both agreed on a divorce. The lawyer was having a hard time getting the papers done, but he still couldn't understand why the old couple would want a divorce, suggesting a  _  together, just three of them. At the table, there was a silence of  _  . The first dish was roasted chicken.  Immediately  , the old man took the drumstick for the old lady, \"Take this, it's your favorite. \" Looking at this, the lawyer thought maybe there was still a  _  , but the wife answered frowning. \"This is where the problem  _  . You always think so highly of yourself, never thought about how I feel, don't you know that I hate  _  ?\" Little did she know that, over the years, her husband was trying all ways to  _  her; little did she know that drumsticks were her husband's favorite. Little did he know that she never thought he understood her at all; little did he know that she hated drumsticks even though all he wanted was the best for her. That night, both of them were difficult to fall asleep. After hours, the old man couldn't  _  it any more, wanting to tell her himself, \"I love you and I can't live without you.\" He picked up the phone to dial her number. Ringing never stopped. On the other side, she was upset,  _  to answer any phones. The next day, she received news that he had  passed away  , learning that he had a heart attack when he was still trying to get through her phone line.  _  enough, she had to clear his  _  dating from the day when they got married, and the beneficiary was her. Together in that file there was this note: \"To my dearest wife, I bought this policy for you,  _  the amount is only $100, I hope it will be able to help me continue my promise that I made when we got married, and I want you to know I will always be around by your side. I love you.\" Tears  _  freely down her cheeks when the lady read it. When you love someone, do let them know, for you  _  know what will happen the next minute.",
