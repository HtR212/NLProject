    "article": "There are times when people are so tired that they fall asleep almost anywhere. We can see there is a lot of sleeping on the bus or train on the  _  home from work in the evenings. A man will be  _  the newspaper, but seconds later,with his head down, it  _  as if he is trying to  _  it . Or he will fall asleep on the shoulder of the stranger  _  next to him.  _  place where unplanned short sleep  happens  is in the lecture hall where a student will start snoring so  _  that the professor has to ask another student to  _  the sleeper awake. A more embarrassing situation happens when a student starts falling into sleep and the  _  of the head pushes the arm down off the  _  , and the movement causes the  _  of the body to move together and finally he falls down to the floor. The student wakes up on the floor with no  _  of the reason for getting there. The worst time to fall asleep is when  _  . Police reports are full of  _  that happen when people fall into sleep and go  _  the road. If the drivers are  _  , they are not seriously hurt. One woman's car,  for example  , went into the river. She woke up in four feet of  _  and thought it was raining. When people are really  _  , nothing will stop them from falling asleep--no matter where they are.",
