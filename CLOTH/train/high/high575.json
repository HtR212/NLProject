    "article": "My school goes all the way from classes for five year olds to classes for 18 year olds, with a  _  area for the junior and senior school.\nLast year, I  ran into  my old year 5 teacher in the library. My teacher called me  _  and asked how I was going. Then she told me about Clare. \"I have a girl in my year 3 class. Her name's Clare and she  _  me so much of you, Cassie. She seems a little bit  _  and quiet in class. Do you think you could come down on lunch time and maybe have a  _  with her?\" Of course I was very  _  to do this and to meet Clare in order to find our how,  _  , she was like me.\nClare turned out to be a pale little girl, slim and small  _  her age. After talking to the 8-year-old for a while, I discovered that we both  _  reading and writing short stories, I  _  the Chronicles of Narnia, explaining that it was a wonderful fantasy series.\nI started  _  the junior school often to read aloud some of the books to Clare. After a while, other girls started coming to  _  too, and I started getting a  reputation  in the junior school as the \"big reading girl\". Some days I didn't read and  _  just talked to Clare. We talked about her friends, school work and books. And she always  _  me so much with her great intelligence.\nThere are days when I get so excited about Clare, about how  _  she is and how far she'll go in life. Being with her and  _  to her excites me to no end, I just wanted to  _  that excitement with you and to encourage everyone to guide somebody in their life who could use a little bit of  _  and encouragement.",
