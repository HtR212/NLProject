    "article": "During the last fifteen years of my mother's life she suffered with Alzheimer's disease . Until then she had been a bright,  _  woman deeply interested and involved in the world around her. I would go home to visit her in Virginia and she would look at me in a(an)  _  way and ask, \"Who are you?\" I would answer, \"I'm your son.\" \"Where do you live?\" She would ask. \"In California,\" I would tell her. \"Isn't that interesting,\" she would say, \"I have a son in California.\" She seemed  _  forgetful and confused at the beginning of the disease,  _  later on she would go  _  periods of intense anxiety. She would pace through the house she had lived in most of her life  _  uneasily that she wanted to go home. Or she would leave home and wander away if she were  _  for a short time. Hoping to please her and put her mind  at ease  I would take her for a drive, visiting sites where she had lived as a  _  . In the yard of the hillside house in Shipman I sat in the car and admired the view of the old oaks and long green lawn. I  _  my mother there was a little girl playing with the pet lamb she had been so fond of. I looked to her for some  _  . She shook her head and said, \"I want to go home.\" Over the years I have decided that what my mother was calling home was not a  _  , but a time. I suspect it was a time when she was much  _  , when her children were still underfoot, when her husband was still vigorous and attentive. Watching my mother's suffering set me wondering  _  I would have in mind if someday I couldn't find  _  and wanted to go there. In this family we tend to be long-lived and we grow fuzzy minded as the years go by. At eighty I have already noticed some  _  symptoms. My doctor says the forgetfulness is only  _  and that it comes with age. Still the fear of Alzheimer's is haunting there. Someday  _  and when I become even more  _  minded than I am now, unable to drive and unable to tell you where \"home\" is, my dear son, I expect I will ask you to take me home, I know you will do your best to find the place I need to be. I leave these notes for your  _  .",
