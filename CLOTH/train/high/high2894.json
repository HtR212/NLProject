I worked hard but no matter how hard I trained, I   _   came in the last. After yet another meet where I came in last, I told my coach that I was going to   _  . I couldn't run. I hated running and all I was doing was pulling the   _   down. I don't remember his words, but I do remember he   _  to let me quit. I remember feeling that he believed in me even though I didn't believe in myself. I kept   _  and participating in the meets. He never gave up on me. Instead, he always encouraged me to keep going, and told me that I could do it.\nThen the final meet came, a huge   _   with less than two hundred students running. We learned that not only the first 20 students   _   the line would win an award, but also the first 100 would be given a running shoe keychain as encouragement. We set off and I quickly  _  behind. I didn't stop and kept running. My friends who  _  me encouraged me to keep running. When I passed the  _  , finally, and received the 100th keychain, there were still students behind me. For the first time, I was not the  _  one! I remember how excited I felt and how my friends felt happy for me.\nThe following week there was a school gathering. We were all called up in front of the school. The coach shared that we were high  _  at the meet, and almost everyone on the team came home with  _  . I felt ashamed, for I was the one who didn't win an award. I only came in the 100th place and didn't  _   his praise. Then he came behind me, put his hands on my shoulders and told the school he was   _  of me because I never gave up and because of that, I pulled from last   _  to the middle of the race--which was an unbelievable personal   _  . He spoke on how we all   _  one another and how well we worked together,   even though  we all were racing alone.\nI still keep that keychain, which tells me never to give up and always work with others. It doesn't matter if you are the first; what matters is doing your best.",
