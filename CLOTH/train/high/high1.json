Fill in each blank with a word or phrase that best fits the context.\n20 June 2013\nAnkara, Turkey: I come from Moldova and I am now working as a UN Volunteer with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Turkey. I have been living in Turkey for a few years and have had the  _  to observe the approach of the Turkish people towards  _  . In Turkey people help each other with their hearts and from their hearts on a continuous basis.\nYoung people are the main driving engine behind the ever-growing volunteer force in Turkey. For Turkish  _  people it is common to be part of some kind of organization or student club on a volunteer basis, doing various activities such as exchanges, environmental action, charity work and peer education.\nThis trend  grew  _  in the late 1990s, despite the fact that civil society organizations have sometimes been viewed with disbelief by some state authorities.\nThis has  _  in the last decade, and many young people now choose to get involved and use their spare time to develop their skills, while also showing their civic participation by  _  to a cause.\nPerhaps this is the reason why the core of the UNV community at UNHCR Turkey is  made up of  young people. Being a UN Volunteer with UNCHR allows us to gain the skills needed to realize our social and human development potential, but also to dedicate our time, energy and ideas to contribute to the  _  of UNHCR's global strategic aims.\nBeing a UN Volunteer with UNHCR is an opportunity to make other people's lives better. Working on refugee status determination has been an interesting and  _  learning experience. Part of the task involves carrying out extensive research on the situation and the condition of the countries the refugees  come from.\nEspecially according to recent events in neighboring countries, and given the arrival of refugees and the increased time necessary to process the  _  number of applications for shelter, the contribution of UN Volunteers to UNHCR seems necessary and the impact invaluable.\nI also believe that I have brought cultural diversity  to an already diverse  _  , where true professionals and young graduates from different nations work hard side by side to  _  refugees and find durable solutions for them.",
