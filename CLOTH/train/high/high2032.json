    "article": "\"Hi, Mom, happy fiftieth birthday!\" I heard my son, Brian, say as  _  as if he were sitting next to me.  _  he wasn't.Brian was on the USS Kitty Hawk on maneuvers  _  between our U.S. shore and the Persian Gulf. My party-loving friend, Denise, had  _  me out for a quiet fiftieth birthday celebration dinner. When we  _  at the restaurant, I scanned the sea of  _  , but didn't recognize anybody. A wave of  _  washed over me, and tears welled in my eyes when  once again  I heard Brian in my head. \"Hi, Mom, happy fiftieth birthday.\" \"What's wrong?\" Denise asked when she saw me dabbing at my  _  . \"I think I've had too much wine. I keep  _  Brian wish me a happy birthday,\" I said. She gave me a(n)  _  smile. \"Our table is ready,\" she said, leading me toward the stairs. I'd hardly sat down in the chair of honor when a  _  entered the room, carrying a sheet of cake. The firefighter  _  the cake on the table in front of me so I could  blow out  the fifty blazing candles. Once again I heard Brian speak, \"Mom, be sure to  _  me a piece of cake.\" This time he  _  very far away, but it seemed that he was just in front of me. I  _  in my chair. Was I losing my mind? \"I'll have some  _  as soon as I get this helmet  _  ,\" the firefighter said. Every drop of blood in my veins flowed to my feet. He  took off  his uniform and quickly pulled the helmet from his head. \"Brian!\" \"Hi Mom. Happy fiftieth birthday!\"",
