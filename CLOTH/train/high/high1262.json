    "article": "I lived on a farm with my parents and my elder brothers and sisters when I was a little boy. We had the  _  to play and run wherever we wanted to go. We often  made up  games just by pretending we were cowboys. Sometimes we played hide-and-seek. One of us would  _  and the others would come and find him. I remember one  _  I hid behind some old wood in the cottage. All was  _  . I couldn't hear a sound, just the wind  _  . The situation became tense  because of  the possibility of someone finding me, and the longer I  _  , the more tense I became.  At last  , I heard footsteps coming down the yard. My  _  beat fast and I stood  _  , frozen like a block of ice. I saw my brother getting closer and closer. When he saw me, he laughed  _  , shouting at the top of his voice so that  _  could hear him say, \"Eh, I've  _  our Tommy!\" I can still see the  _  on his face today. Afterwards he said he didn't think I would hide there. I shrugged my shoulders and said, \"Why, it's a good place, isn't it?\" I don't have any  _  of these events, just memories, as we had no camera at that time.  _  it was a long time ago, I can see them now as if they  _  yesterday. Now I live in town on a busy street. My girls don't have the freedom that we  used to  have to run off down the road and play whatever they want. Anyway, is it  _  to let children out of sight these days?",
