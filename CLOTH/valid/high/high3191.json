    "article": "At the end of 2014, Tulsa, Oklahoma, sixthgrade teacher Melissa Bour received a friend   _   on Facebook from one of her students. She didn't accept the request, but a quick browse through the girl's friends list revealed the names of dozens of kids from her   _  . Many of the students' Facebook pages were completely   _  , meaning even strangers could   search through   the kids' personal photos and messages.\n\"I saw middle fingers, students dressed inappropriately, and extremely   _   language,\" Melissa says. \"It was   _  .\" When she brought up her   _   in class, the students were not   _   at all. So she created a   _   of her own. With a bright green marker pen, she wrote on a piece of paper: \"Dear Facebook: my 12yearold students think it is 'no   big deal  ' that they are posting pictures of themselves... Please help me show them how   _   their images can get around.\" She put a picture of the letter on her Facebook page and asked people to   _   it.\nIn hours, it was shared 108,000 times across dozens of states and four countries. She   _   it after eight hours, but it continued to spread. \"I wanted to   _   them that it's on the Internet forever,\" she says.\nAs she explained the results of her   _   in class, the students' eyes got bigger and bigger. \"It scared a few of them into deleting their pages   _  ,\" she says. Others have removed inappropriate posts and used privacy settings to   _   their pages.\nHer   _   wasn't to scare them off social media but to push them to be   _   of what they post. Melissa says, \"I tell them, 'It doesn't   _   you have to just because everyone else is sharing.'\"",
