Following my bedtime story, he would give me a nose  _  , and whisper the most wonderful words into my ear. \"Michelle, of all the little girls in the whole wide world . . .\" he would pause. \" Yes, Daddy?\" \" How did your mommy and I get so  _  to get the best one?\"  _  he had time to finish, I would say, \"You got me!\" And then he would continue , \"The best little girl in the whole wide world, and we got you.\" He would end with a bear hug and  _  kiss to my forehead. Years passed and my father never missed a night, even when I thought he should have. After my basketball team was  _  , he came into my room. \" Michelle, of all the basketball players in the whole wide world,\" he paused. \" Yes, Daddy?\" I stared at the floor. \" How did your mom and I get so lucky to get the best one?\" \" You didn't.\" \" Of course we did, Michelle. We have you.\" After I  _  from college, I became engaged. My father never missed a night to call or leave a message  _  me how special I was to him. I even wondered if he would continue calling after I got  _  , but he didn't. The daily calls I had taken for granted all my life ended the day he died from cancer, only weeks before my wedding. I deeply missed  _  the days with my father. Standing behind the white church doors, I waited for the wedding march to begin. Before we walking down the aisle, my brother  _  inside his pocket and handed me an ivory napkin. Inscribed were the words:  _  Without doubt , it was the best wedding gift I  _  , One I would never forget. My father showered me with his gifts every day of his life. How did I get so lucky?",
