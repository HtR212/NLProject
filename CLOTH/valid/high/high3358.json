My hero is Mr. Wright, my chorus  teacher.\nWhen I was 12 years old, my grandparents passed away. I was really close to them, and losing them was the hardest thing I've ever had to  _  through. I couldn't eat, sleep, or think; I felt like I couldn't even breathe. It was as if my whole world had fallen down from under me, and I  _  into this huge hole of depression .\n  _  I was battling depression, I was determined to make my high school years the best of my life. It was difficult to be  _  , but I had to try. I joined Women's Choir. Mr. Wright was the choral director and he was so funny that the first day, I just knew I had made the best  _  of my life. As the year progressed, I loved chorus more and more. I began to smile again and really enjoy  _  .\nThen one day that all changed. My friends--or those that I thought were my friends--started talking about me behind my back. I was  _  , and I sat by myself. Mr. Wright came over and asked what was wrong. The look in his eyes told me that I could  _  him. Trying hard to  _  back tears, I told him the whole story.\nWhen I finished, he nodded and told me, \"If you never learn anything from me, learn this: No one is worth  _  your joy.\" What Mr. Wright said really  _  a chord   in my heart. He  _  cared about me and what was going on. I'll never be able to thank him enough, because he not only saved me but has  _  every day of it since. Any time I feel like giving  _  , I remember Mr. Wright's words and push forward.\nI'm proud to say that I  _  my depression, and I'm now a senior. I'm still a  _  of chorus, and now I'm also in the best choir at my school.\nMr. Wright is a hero  _  everyone he meets. He cares about every single person who walks through his door, and he loves what he does more than any other teacher I've known. That's  _  he deserves to be Educator of the Year. He deserves the  _  not just this year but every year.\nI'm glad I had the opportunity to meet you, Mr. Wright. You are an  _  teacher, and I hope you realize that. You're my hero.",
