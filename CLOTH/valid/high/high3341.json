    "article": "We arrived in Spain for the  _  time a few weeks ago and I decided to buy a car because we had sold  the one  we had in England before leaving. Yesterday the  _  office rang us to tell the car was ready. I had  _  out a model like it before but as I was not yet used to  _  in this city, my wife did not want me to collect it on my own, so we went  together  to fetch it. We paid for the car and  _  the papers. They told us there was enough  _  to take us to a garage, where we could fill up. The nearest garage to the  _  was about 100 yards away and we got there  safely  .But when I turned into the main road I suddenly saw a lot of  _  racing towards me .I got out of their way as  _  as I could by backing into the garage once more and the man behind  _  at me . \"It's such a  _  to remember to drive on the right, isn't it?\" My wife said.\"Yes, if only I had  _  a few lessons for practice,\" I replied . \"You'd better go carefully on the way  home  ,\" my wife said. \"You 'd be  _  if you had an accident  _  the first day, wouldn't you ?\" While we were talking, the man behind  _  out of his car and said in good English, \"Would you mind telling me when you are thinking of leaving ,  _  are you going to sit in your car all the day?\"",
