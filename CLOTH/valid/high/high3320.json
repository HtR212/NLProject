    "article": "I remember my dad teaching me the power of language at a very young age. One fairly interesting event happened when I was eight. As a kid, I was always climbing trees, poles, and  _  around upside down from the rafters of our house. So, it  _  to no surprise for my dad to  _  me at the top of a 30-foot tree swinging back and forth. Without realizing the tree could break or I could get  _  , I just thought it was  _  to be up so high. My cousin, Tammy, was in the same tree. She was hanging on the first big  _  about ten feet below me. Tammy's mother also  _  us at the exact time my dad did. About that time a huge gust of wind came over the tree and I could feel the tree begin to sway. I remembered my dad's  _  over the wind yelling, \"Bart,  _  on tightly.\" So I did. The next thing I know, I heard Tammy  _  at the top of her lungs,  _  flat on the ground. She had fallen out of the tree. I came down the tree to  _  . My dad later told me why Tammy fell and I didn't.  _  , when Tammy's mother felt the wind, she yelled out, \"Tammy, don't  _  !\" And Tammy did do that. My dad then  _  to me that the mind has a very  _  time dealing with a negative image. In order to deal with the  _  of not falling, Tammy's brain had to first imagine falling, and then tell the brain not to do what it just imagined. However, my eight-year-old brain  _  had an internal image of hanging on tightly. This \"Self-Talk\" is especially useful when you are  _  to break a habit or set a goal. You can't imagine not doing something in your mind. The only way to accomplish it is to find a word for what you want to do. I'm now a pretty good football player, because all my internal dialogue is  _  and encourages me to win. All this I owe to my dad.",
