    "article": "Over the past few decades, more and more countries have opened up the markets, increasingly transforming the world economy into one free-flowing global market. The question is:Is economic globalization  _  for all? According to the World Bank, one of its chief supporters, economic globalization has helped reduce  _  in a large number of developing countries. It quotes one study that shows increased wealth  _  to improved education and longer life in twenty-four developing countries as a result of integration of local economies into the world economy. Home to some three billion people, these twenty-four countries have seen incomes  _  at an average rate of five percent--compared to two percent in developed countries. Those who  _  globalization claim that economies in developing countries will benefit from new opportunities for small and home-based businesses.  For instance  , small farmers in Brazil who produce nuts that would originally have sold only in  _  open-air markets can now promote their goods worldwide by the Internet. Critics take a different view, believing that economic globalization is actually  _  the gap between the rich and poor. A study carried out by the U.N.-sponsored World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization shows that only a few developing countries have actually  _  from integration into the world economy and that the poor, the uneducated, unskilled workers, and native peoples have been left behind.  _  , they maintain that globalization may eventually threaten emerging businesses. For example, Indian craftsmen who currently seem to benefit from globalization because they are able to  _  their products may soon face fierce competition that could put them out of  _  . When large-scale manufacturers start to produce the same goods, or when superstores like Wal-Mart move in, these small businesses will not be able to  keep up  and will be crowded out. One thing is certain about globalization--there is no  turning back  . Advances in technology combined with more open policies have already created an interconnected world. The  _  now is finding a way to create a kind of globalization that works for the benefit of all.",
