In and outside of work, I always wear a37 _ and try to be nice to others.\n     But recently, I've been38 _ by some people who always help others. So, today, when I went to work, I decided I would take my first big step and truly help a39 _ .\n      Two young girls came into the40 _ and looked around. I offered them my 41 _ \"Welcome to Baskin Robbins\" greeting. A couple of minutes later42 _ of them finally decided upon the flavor  of ice cream ---- chocolate. So then, I made a big spoon, put it in a cone  and43 _ it to her. Sadly, though, the other girl didn't get anything even though I could44 _ she was looking at the many kinds of45 ice cream and wanted to have one.\n      It was at this time that the other girl, who obviously was the young sister,46 cried out , \"I wish I could have one\". I knew when I heard this comment that it was my47 _ to do something for her. So, I told her that I would48 pay for her ice cream. She immediately calmed down though she didn't believe what she49 _ . I asked her what flavor she wanted and handed her the treat. I then50 _ out the $3 for it and placed the money in the counter.\n      She was so51 _ and her  older sister was surprised. It was  _  good\nto help this girl and made her feel special for a moment. I turned around and\nfound that my  _  all looked at me\nlike I was crazy. But, I didn't  _  that\nI spent a little, because the feeling I  _  from\nmy action was worth a million dollars.",
