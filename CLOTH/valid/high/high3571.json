    "article": "Our children grew up on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, although my husband and I sometimes sneak one late at night with a glass of milk. I believe that the success of this   _  loved\nconcoction  lies not in the brand of peanut butter,   but rather  in the jelly. The right jelly  _  the\nplate, and homemade is the only choice.\nMy mother-in-law was the jelly maker in this family. This limited choice was a welcome    _  in the days of toddlers, siblings and puppies. All I did was to  _  baby food jars, which my mother-in-law would seal with wax  and    _  back\nhome with us.  _  I wanted to make a peanut butter and\njelly sandwich , all I had to do was reach for one of little jars. Jelly making\nwas just a way of  _  for my mother-in-law. She always\ndid it, setting the  _  jelly on the shelves .\nMy father-in-law died several years ago and this past December, she also    passed away  . Among the things\nin the house to be divided by her children were the  _  canned\ngoods.\nThe other day I reached my pantry  for jelly for a quick sandwich. Sitting all alone on the far side of the shelf was a small jar of grape jelly, whose lid was   _  in places.  _  on\nit were \"GR\" for grape and the year when the jelly was made.\nAs I picked up the jar, I suddenly realized something that I had    _  to see\nearlier. This was the last jar we would ever have from the  _   ,loving hands . We hardly ever opened a jar of jelly at table without  _  about those thousands of little jars she had filled. It seems like\nsuch a small thing, and most days it was something that was  _  for\ngranted.\nNo longer was it just a jar of jelly. It was the end of a family   _  . We have hundreds of\npictures and many more memories that we expect to  _  the\nyears and to pass on to our children. The jar of jelly won't keep that long. It\nwill either have to be eaten or  thrown out  ...but not today.",
