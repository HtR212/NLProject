Fill in each blank with the word or phrase that best fits the context.\nGerman universities, known for their excellence throughout the world in the early part of the 20thcentury, are in a state of\ndecline, according to Michael Burda, an American economics professor at\nBerlin's Humholdt University.\nBurda claims that Germany's 300 schools of   _  learning are being hurt by \"a long-time shortage of general  _  .\n\"No statistic  makes this more evident than a low proportion of young Germans actually   completing  university-level\ndegrees,\" he says.\nOnly 22 per cent of German students aged 24-34   successfully  complete their university studies.That's compared to 31 percent in the UK, and 39 percent in the US,   according to  the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD).\nOne reason for the decline is that Germany spends barely 1.1 per cent of its gross   _  product(GDP) on higher education, compared to 2.6 percent in the US.\n\" A central reason why so few Germans  _  university\ndegrees here is the deterioration(/) in the   _  of education.This certainly comes from the rise in the number of students per teacher.Those who have the will and the means often study   abroad  ,\" he said.\nSince the 1960s, more than 90 percent of German higher education has been publicly supported.Famous universities are still public institutions,   _  by federal and regional\ngovernments.\nPrivate funding of universities is   _  in\nGermany.This comes from the country's lack of a donating tradition and rules limiting the amounts of tax-free donations.\n         But now there signs that   _  may be changing.\nProfessor Dieter Lenzen, president of Berlin's Free University, agrees that  _  money has to be spent on higher\neducation.But he disputes Burda's claim that German universities are in    _  .\n\"A decade ago that may have been the   _  ,\nbut that was a result of the unsteady situation at the time of reunification.Now, things have changed for the better,\" Lenzen said.",
