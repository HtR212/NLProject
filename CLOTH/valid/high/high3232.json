That's quite a story.\nOne day I brought my dog Louie for a(n)   _  . \"Louie weighs too much. This puts him at risk for diabetes and heart disease. Each extra pound takes two years   _   his life. I know you don't want that. \" Dr. Mayer said.\n\"Of course not! \" \n\"Then you have to help him lose weight.

That's when I decided to   _   one.  \nNow I have clubs in every state and even as far away as Singapore and all that was inspired by my love for Louie.   \nIt wasn't until I was forced to face the truth that I discovered nothing is impossible if you have the right   _  .",
