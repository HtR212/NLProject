One day Peggy said to me, \"Life is too  _  , you need to spend time with the people you love. You probably won't believe me, but I know you love her and I think that if the two of you spend more time together, it will make us  _  .' The \"other\" woman my wife was encouraging me to  _  is my mother, a 72-year-old widow who has lived alone since my father  passed away  20 years ago. Right after his death, I  _  2,500 miles away to California and started my own life and career. When I moved back near my hometown six years ago, I promised myself that I would spend more time with mom. But with the  _  of my job and three kids, I never got around to seeing her much  _  family get-togethers and holidays. Mom was  _  and suspicious when I called and suggested the two of us go out to dinner and a movie. We didn't go anywhere  _  , just a neighborhood place where we could talk.  _  her eyes now see only large shapes and shadows, I had to read the menu for both of us. \"I used to be the  _  when you were little,\" she said. \"Then it is time for you to relax and let me  _  the favor,\" I said. We had a nice talk  _  dinner, just catching up on each other's lives. We talked for so long that we  _  the movie. \"  _  was your date?\" my wife asked when I got home that evening. 'Nice...nicer than I thought it would be,' I said. Mom and I get out for  _  a couple of times a month. Sometimes we take in a movie, but  _  we talk. Through the talks ,I know what it was like for her to work in a factory during the Second World War. I know how she met my father there, and know how they  went though  the difficult times. I can't get enough of these stories. They are  _  to me, a part of my history. Peggy was right. Dating another woman has  _  my marriage.",
