The school bell called us back inside, and we were dismissed to  _  our way home the best way we could. I'd walked a quarter of the threemile trip to my home  _  a car horn frightened me to  _  . My Uncle Barney  pulled up  alongside me in his old Ford. The instant I saw him, I knew my father  was gone  . Otherwise, Papa would have  _  for me himself.
