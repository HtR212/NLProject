Money was tight and he became  _  when the child tried to decorate a  _  to put under the Christmas tree.  _  , the little girl brought the gift to her  _  the next morning and said, \" This is for you , Daddy.\" The man was  _  by his earlier  _  , but his anger flared again when he found out the box was  _  . He yelled at her, stating, \"Don't you know when you give someone a present, there is  _  to be something inside?\" The little girl looked  _  at him with tears in her eyes and cried, \" Oh, Daddy, it is not empty  at all  . I blew kisses into the box. They are all for you, Daddy.\" The father was crushed. He  _  his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her  _  . Only a short time later, an  _  took the life of the child. It is also told that her father kept that gold box by his bed for many  _  and whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an  _  kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.

There is simply no other  _  , anyone could hold, more  _  than this.",
