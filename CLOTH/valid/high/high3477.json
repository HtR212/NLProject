    "article": "Just Help the Next Person The only highway to go to work that we had to drive was closed down due to an accident on the bridge. A truck had hit the bridge and made it  _  for any traffic to go over it. So in order to get to  _  I had to go a number of miles out of my way. Not being that  _  with this road and not knowing  _  all the pot holes in the road were, I topped a hill and right in my path was a big pot hole. I felt and heard the familiar sound of a flat tire. I  _  as far to the right as possible and stopped. I tried several times to change the tire, but  _  . There I sat out in the country and no way to  get in touch  with anybody. Just then, I looked in my rear view mirror and a  _  was pulling out of a pasture behind me. I was  _  and scared at the same time. I was struggling to get the  _  out when this man in the pickup pulled in behind me. He got out to introduce himself and  _  to help me. When he got the spare out we discovered that the spare is also  _  . He told me he would take the tire and have it  _  and call my husband. We got the tire fixed  _  he took me back to my car. My husband was there  waiting on  us when we got back. The kind stranger stayed there and helped my husband  _  the tire. After they finished we  _  thanked him and offered to pay him for his  _  . I will never forget his words, \" your thanks is  more than  enough pay and I just hope if this ever happens to my wife or daughter someone will be so  _  as to help them.\"",
