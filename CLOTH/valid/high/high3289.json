    "article": "In 2014 I was 22 years old and had just come back to Brazil after 14 months in England, holding my Cambridge Proficiency certificate. After nervously 31 _  a short training course, I began to give class to my 12 students, all of them older than I was. I   _   hard to remain calm in class and   _   they wouldn't find out how unconfident I felt a lot of the time. I was quite   _  , actually, until the end of the  _   and the night of the final oral test.\nThe test was going to start at 7 pm, and at 6:50, I   _   myself in the teachers' bathroom to   go over   all the test questions again. I really wanted to learn the   _   by heart so no one would think I was an inexperienced tester. The   _   is, I actually locked myself in the bathroom. I   _   couldn't get out! The bell rang at 7 pm and I could hear the noise in the halls   _   the students went to their rooms. I tried hard to   _   the bathroom door, but failed.\nI heard the cleaning lady's voice and asked for help .   _  , she wasn't exactly a thoughtful person, and started   _  ;\"Diana's locked in the bathroom!\"Shame had fallen upon me!   Soon enough   the course director, the secretary and some teachers were outside the bathroom trying to get me out, and,   to my horror   ,my students gathered outside too, happily saying things like \"Aren't we   _  !No test today !\" All I could do was   _  , feeling miserable and utterly stupid. The door finally opened, and my entire   _   was waiting for me outside, naughty smiles on their faces.\"   Don't worry  ! Teacher.\" they said,\" we know you are human too!\"\nThey all passed their test. True to the Brazilian style, we all went out for a beer afterward, and laughed the whole thing off.",
