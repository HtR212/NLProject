    "article": "An old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and a four-year-old grandson. The family ate together at the dinner table. But the grandfather's shaking hands and   _  sight made eating rather difficult: peas   rolled  off  his spoon  onto the floor and milk spilled  on the tablecloth.\n \tThe son and daughter-in-law became   _  with the mess and set a small table for him.   Since  grandfather would break a dish or two, his food was served in a   _  bowl.\n \tThe grandfather ate alone.   _  , when he dropped a knife or spilled food, the only words the couple had for him were   _  warnings. The four-year-old son watched it all   in silence  .\n \tOne evening, the father noticed his   _  playing with wood on the floor. He asked   _  ,\"What're you making?\"Just as sweetly, the boy   _  , \"I'm making a bowl for you and mama to eat your food from   _  I grow up.\"  Tears down their cheeks, the parents were so   _  . Though no word was spoken,   _  knew what must be done. That evening the husband took grandfather's hand and   _  led him back to the family table.\n \t  _  are really sensitive. Their eyes always   _  , their ears always listen and their   _  always process the messages they absorb. If they see us patiently provide a peaceful home   _  for family members, they will naturally   _  it for the rest of their lives. The wise parent realizes that every day is being laid for the child's future.",
