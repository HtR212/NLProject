    "article": "A Japanese farmer bought a big foreign tractor to grow his corn and apples in northern Japan. The giant tractor   _  the waste land into fields at an amazing speed.  _  , he was troubled by the damage caused by raccoon dogs .Just when the sweet corn was ready to be  _  ,it was ruined.\n\"I placed  _  in several places around the fields,but ended up trapping a young raccoon dog. The mother stayed next to it,and didn't  runaway  when I approached. When I tried   _  out to release the trap,the young raccoon dog bared its   _  and got really upset. It seems cruel,but I held its head down with my rubber boot   _  I released it from the trap. It didn't run away,though. Right in front of   _  , the mother started licking the young one's   _  leg. Seeing that, I felt committed an awful crime. \"\n\"I  _  told them 'Stop eating our corny But then I started leaving small piles of second rate corn around the   _  of the fields. They're not good enough to sell. The next morning when I went to the fields, they'd completely   _  . But the raccoon dogs had caused   no  more damage at all. So at harvest time I decided to   _  using the traps and put out the corncobs without kernels .After that,  _   by the raccoon dogs stopped almost completely. So I figured that farmers suffer this sort of damage because they   _  everything. After all,we,d turned what used to  belong to  the raccoon dogs into fields. I worried that if I actually fed them,the raccoon dogs would even more  _  ,but that didn't happen.\nI suppose you could say that my eyes were opened to the mysteries of nature. Anyway,I realized that nature didn't work in the  _  that most people thought.\"",
