    "article": "The story happened on a hot heavy rainy day. After class, I took a few bottles to go and  _  some water from the water room. Oh! There were so many people! I had to wait  _  the rain. My hair didn't get wet because I wore a hat, but my clothes  _  . When at last it was my  _  , I filled the bottles as quickly as possible. I began making my way back when I saw a boy  _  towards me. He  was holding  two umbrellas in his hand. He shouted hello and as he came  _  , I recognized that it was Tom. He  had been  my classmate for nearly three years, but we never  _  more than ten sentences. He was silent, but I liked talking. We were quite  strange  people and had nothing in common. I didn't  _  him and even didn't want to see him. \"Hey! What's wrong?\" His words  _  me out of my thought. \"I saw you  standing  in the rain, so I brought you this umbrella. But it seems a little  _  , your clothes are already wet,\" On hearing this, I was so  _  that I couldn't say a single word. \"Don't just stand there. Let's go!\" He said and held the umbrella for me. We walked towards  the dormitory  and this time we talked  a lot  . \"I know you don't like me, but I want to  make friends  with you.\" he said, \"You may think I am silent, but it is because I can't find the right  _  to say.\" The rain finally stopped and we saw a rainbow in the blue sky. I said to myself, \"It is wrong to  _  someone only by his appearance.",
