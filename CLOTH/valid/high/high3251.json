Lucy, a girl in my  _  , who I thought wasn't ready to accept a  _  girl, didn't like me from the start.  _  ,I was pretty sure she hated me. When I asked her a question, I could  _  she thought I was a total fool. My teacher made us  _  next to each other for the last term. Lucy was not happy. However, I kept  _  at her, though she rolled her eyes, and I kept telling her that she was beautiful. Finally, Lucy let me  _  to her, even when her friends were around. She  _  telling me how beautiful I looked. I still remember the  _  time when she smiled at me and said that, and I smiled right back, saying  _  to her. One day Lucy invited me over to her house, and talked to me all the time  instead of  her other friends. That day Lucy , the girl who had hated me, called me her best deskmate. After that, we  _  friends for years. I moved to Arizona later, but I will never  _  Lucy. I still remember she considered me her  _  at first. During that time it felt like I was  _  my time, and losing my dignity ,but I still smiled at Lucy even when she  made fun of  me. I'm not stupid; I didn't think she was  _  in doing those things, but I still put up with it. And finally we became great friends. Not long ago, I read the  _  of Abraham Lincoln, \"Am I not destroying my enemies when I make friends of them?\" I smiled, thinking of Lucy. It just  _  me how great a friend I used to have.",
