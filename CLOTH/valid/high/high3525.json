A couple would like to sit together.\" The only  _  seat was next to a girl with her arms in casts  , a black-and-blue face, and a sad expression. \"  No way  am I going to sit there,\" I thought immediately. But a soft voice spoke, \"She needs help.\" Finally, I  _  to move to that seat.\nThe girl was named Kathy. She  had been  in a car accident and now was on her way for  _  .\nWhen the snack and juice arrived, it did not take me long to  _  that Kathy would not be able to  _  herself. I considered  _  to feed her but hesitated, as it seemed too  _  to offer a service to a  _  . But then I realized that Kathy's need was more  _  than my discomfort. I offered to help her eat, and  _  she was uncomfortable to accept, she  _  as I expected. We became closer and closer in a short period of time. By the end of the five-hour trip, my heart  had warmed  , and the  _  was really better spent than if I had just sat by myself.\nI was very glad I had reached  _  my comfort zone to sit next to Kathy and feed her. Love  _  flows beyond human borders and removes the fears that keep us  _  . When we stretch to serve   another  , we grow to live in a larger and more rewarding world.",
