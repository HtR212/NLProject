One day I had a(n)   _   fight with my father.We both exploded into shouts.I   _   out of the house and missed my bus to school.\nI rushed all the way to school.As I   _   across the campus toward my class, I suddenly realized I didn't have the   _   that was due: a thought card.My professor asked us to   bring along   an index card with our names and the dates every  Tuesday.   As for   what was on the rest of the card, we could write a thought, a question or something else.\nNow, outside the door, ten minutes later, I took an index card.   _   to write something on it, I could only think about the   _   I'd just had with my dad.I wrote \"I am the son of an idiot!\",then   _   into the room, and handed it to our professor.\nNext day, our professor   gave back   the thought cards and I   _   he wrote, \"What does the 'son of an idiot' do with the rest of his life?\" The professor's innocentseeming question   _   me to the issue: whose problem is it?   _  , my thinking began to shift.I realized that I had created a life   in which   I was not a central figure!\nThe   _   of growth wasn't easy or fast.   _   later,from a struggling student, I became a successful student and then a successful teacher.",
