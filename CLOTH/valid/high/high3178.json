    "article": "One summer night, I was at a bowling alley celebrating a friend's birthday. Two of the friends   _  brought their daughter, Bridget. Like most eight-year-olds, the girl was   _  about the game, so her parents set her up with a light bowling ball.\nThe first game, Bridget scored a five which is as   _  as it sounds. What was a   _  , however, was her   _  toward it. She didn't scream or cry. She gave a shrug , and that was it.\n\"Don't worry, Bridget,\" her parents   _  her. \"You can play again next time!\"\nYes, she could play again next time, because the   _  thing about bowling is that there are multiple games, and you have multiple chances to 48 make up for a low score. And she did   _  again.\nThe scond game finally   _  with a score of 45. \"Yeah!\" She screamed and her   _  were so proud. I was proud of her too, proud of her for handling a situation in a much more   _  way than I ever could.\nThis little eight-year-old girl knew a   _  about life that I didn't learn until my late 20s: Our failures, especially ones as   _  as getting a low score in a bowling game, aren't tied to our self-worth. She knew that her low score had   _  to do with her identity as a person, her skills or intelligence. More importantly, she knew it was 56 _ a bowling game.\nIsn't learning how to   _  one of the best gifts you can give a child?   _  , watching someone deal with failure in a healthy and graceful way is a pretty great   _  , too. So thank Bridget for giving me one of the best gifts I've ever received. And it wasn't even my   _  .",
