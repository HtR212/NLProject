During my teenage years, my dad  _  told me that he thought I was going to be foolish because I  _  at him whenever he asked me where the  _  was.\nI consider myself to be a \"Daddy's girl\". Dad never  _  me, but he did buy me nice things---dolls and shoes---for my birthday. I am now 28, and I  _  live with my parents in Baguio, Philippines.  _  my father is always very busy, we still  _  time with each other. We  _  go for a drive in the country.
