    "article": "There is a workman in America who earns as much as a company director. He is Max Quarterman, a thirty-year-old plasterer  .\nMax lives in an upper middle-class housing estate. His   _   are mostly bank managers, business executives, airline pilots and the   _  , but Max's seven-bedroom house --  _   $ 80,000 -- is the largest in the area.   _   outside the house are Max's $ 7000 sports car and his wife's Morris Mini. Indoors is a 150 colour TV set and the family's   _   -- a circular bath with gold-plated taps. There are also many labour-saving   _   and luxury furniture.\nHow can a plasterer   _   all this? The answer, says Max, is hard work. In   _   with another plasterer, Max   _   contract plastering jobs for a firm. The owner of the firm  _   them as human machines, the best and quickest in the   _  , who can do as much in two days as 48 _  two-man team can in two weeks.\nHow do they manage it? Not by working overtime. They work a(n) 49 _  eight-hour day, five days a week. The secret   _   in Max's hod   in which he carries the plaster to the site of the job. Max's is a superhod -- it contains double the usual   _   of plaster, and Max, a strong fellow, runs when he carries it. More time is thus   _   to get on with the plastering. Besides,   _   man wastes time smoking, and they 54 _   their lunch break to a  _   of an hour a day. Now Max earns over $ 800 a week which is four times the average weekly pay in Britain today, and if he gets as   _   as $ 15, it's a disaster.",
