One way to help is to buy their monthly magazine.   _   doing this one day, I   got to know   a young homeless man. He was often   _   the magazine at the train station.\nHe was a poor farmer from another country. After a while, I discovered that his birthday was   close to   mine. It meant that we were born in the same   _  .\nI met him last year   _   after his birthday, and after congratulating him, without   _  , I asked if he had had a good day. He   looked down    and said that he hadn't really celebrated. I felt so   _  .\nI just couldn't bear the thought of  this nice, young man being   _    on his 25thbirthday with no presents, no cake, nothing! So I went home and looked in my\nyarn  basket. Luckily for me, I had enough yarn   _  . I set to work and knitted   a   _   for the young man. The yarn had become a little dirty   _   I didn't knit very often. Then I washed the yarn so the scarf would be   _   when he got it.\nI met him on my own birthday as I was going shopping. I had   _   to meet him so I had   _   the scarf and a piece of my own birthday cake around with me. He was very   _    with these gifts and so was I. The    _   in his eyes was the best present he could have given me!",
