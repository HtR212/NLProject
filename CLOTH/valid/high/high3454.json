    "article": "I had an experience recently with someone saying that he had made a  _  fifteen years ago. He told me that he had been the  _  of a certain store in the neighborhood where I once  _  , and he asked me if I remembered the egg cartons .\nI was about eight years old at the time, and I had  _  into the store with my mother as usual to do the shopping. On that  _  day, there must have been a sale on eggs  _  there was an attractive display of eggs in dozen and half-dozen cartons. The cartons were  _  one on top of another, about three or four feet  _  . I stopped in front of a display and watched those cartons  _  Just then a woman came up with a full basket in her hand and  knocked over  the cartons. For some reason, I  _  it was up to me to put the display back together, so I went to work.\nThe manager heard the  _  and came rushing over to see what had happened. When he  _  ,  I was on my knees checking some of the cartons to see if any of the eggs were  _  , but to him it looked as though it was I who did that. He wanted me to  pay for  those eggs. I tried to  explain  , but he did not believe me. After so many years, I had almost forgotten all about it;  however  , the manager hadn't.\nOne of the qualities that most people like in others is their  _  to say sorry. It is extremely  _  sometimes to say a simple thing like \" sorry, I was wrong about that.\" That's why I have  _  opinions of this manager now.",
