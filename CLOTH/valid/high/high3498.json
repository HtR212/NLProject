We each were asked to give an oral   _  in front of the whole class. When my turn came, I became   _  and I started swinging my legs back and forth. I did this during the entire presentation  . I was a   _  student and I did not realize I was doing it.\nAfter I completed my presentation, I   _  did or even wanted to give another  oral presentation for the rest of my years in school.   _  I got older, I realized I wanted to improve my personality and build   _  over my fear. I began listening to motivational speeches ( ). I would go to   _  seminars   and found I was feeling better and better about myself. This   _  me to want to reach out and help others in need.\nAfter listening to one particular speaker many times, I decided to write to him for   _  . He had advised in his speeches that if there was something you wanted to   _  , you should be persistent . So I became very persistent.\nI wrote to his office many times and they   _  called me back. They offered me help by instructing me to    _  a local Toastmasters and see what it was all about. Toastmasters is a great organization for people who are interested in improving their     _  skills in preparation and presentation in front of a(n)   _  . I certainly needed to do this. I located the nearest Toastmasters and   _  a meeting.\nAt first, I sat in the background and was too overcome by my   _  . I did not even want to introduce myself. But by   _  this was just the false evidence appearing real, I  _  my fear and within a short period of time I was President of that Toastmasters.\nDon't get  _  in fears from unpleasant past experiences. Fears are  _  but false evidence appearing real, which are made broken.",
