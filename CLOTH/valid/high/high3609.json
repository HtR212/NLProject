Once when he was asked about his  _  , he told the story about a young man, son of a horse trainer.\nOne day at high school the boy was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up.\nThat night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his dream of someday  _  a horse ranch. He  _  about his dream in great detail and even drew a diagram   of a very large ranch, showing the location of everything important there.\nThe next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he got his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a  _  that read, \"See me after class.\"\nThe boy went to the teacher. The teacher said, \"This is an impossible dream for a young boy like you. You come from a  _  family. Having a ranch requires a lot of money. There's no way you could ever do it.\" Then he  _  , \"If you rewrite this paper with a more practical goal, I will  _  your grade .\"\nThe boy went home and thought about it long and  _  . Finally, the boy turned in the same paper, making no  _  at all. He said, \"You can keep the F and I'll keep my  _  .\"\nMonty then said, \"I was that boy. And the best part of the story is that two summers ago that  _  teacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week. When he was leaving, the teacher said, 'When I was your teacher, I was something of a dream stealer. During those years I stole a lot of kids' dreams. Luckily, you had enough  _  not to give up yours.'\"",
