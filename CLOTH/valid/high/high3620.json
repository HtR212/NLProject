One day there came a  _  rain, and it wet their wings. They  _  home, but when they got there they found the door  _  and the key gone. So they had to stay outdoors in the  _  . Soon they flew to the  _  and yellow tulip , and said, \"Friend Tulip, will you open your flower and let us  _  till the storm is over?\" The tulip  _  , \"The red and yellow butterflies may enter, because they are  _  me, but the white one may not come in.\"  _  the red and yellow butterflies said, \"If our white brother may not find shelter in your flower, we'll stay  _  in the rain with him.\" It fained harder and harder, and the  _  little butterflies flew to the white lily and said, \"Good Lily, will you  _  your bud a little so we may fly in out of the rain?\" The lily answered, \"The white butterfly may  come in  , because he is like me , but the red and yellow ones must stay outside in the storm..\" Then the little white butterfly said, \"If you won't  _  my red and yellow brothers, I'll stay out in the rain with them. We would rather be  _  than be separated.\" So the three little butterflies flew away. But the  _  , who was behind a cloud,  _  it all, and he knew what good little  _  the butterflies were. So he pushed his face through the clouds, drove away the rain, and  _  brightly on the garden. He dried the  _  of the butterflies, and warmed their bodies. They danced among the flowers till evening. When they flew back home, they found the door wide open.",
