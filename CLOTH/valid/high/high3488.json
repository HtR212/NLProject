    "article": "My husband has been ill in hospital for two months and I have learned to make do with very little . One Sunday afternoon, I went to buy a  storybook  for my daughter with my friend. A woman who was also buying books in the bookstore saw me and said, \"I  _  you must be having a hard time.\" I just smiled and said, \"I'm okay. I have eight dollars and I have food at home, so I'll be  _  .\" About ten  _  later she came up to me and said, \"Can I take a look at the book that you've  _  ? It seems very interesting!\" I said all right and gave it to her. Just then  _  called me and I immediately went out.  _  I returned she thanked me and  gave back  my book. On my way home my friend who was driving said, \"You told me you didn't had much  _  ?\" I replied, \"I don't.\" She said, \"Oh yes, you do!\" I assured (......) her I  _  had two dollars left, but still she insisted I  _  plenty of money. \"Look at your book in your bag,\" she  _  . \"There's a hundred dollar bill in it.\" I turned over the page and got so  _  ! There actually was a hundred dollar  _  that seemed to have fallen out of my book! I  looked at  her, very surprised, and said, \"I don't know  _  that came from. I have no idea because I certainly did not have a hundred  _  \" I thought and thought about the money for days after that. Then I realized it must have come from  the lady  who asked to borrow my book in the bookstore. How  _  of her! And what a wonderful gift to  _  when I am down to my last two dollars!",
