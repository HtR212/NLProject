    "article": "My mother lived in an old farm house in north Oregon,which was located far from any other neighbors.She lived with her elder brother and sisters.Since there were not enough rooms for them,her two sisters  _  the bigger bedroom downstairs,her brother in a room down the hall and she slept in the top room of the building. The first  _  event that happened in that house was when my mother was about 10 years old.She was staying home sick with her brother.He had gone  _  to the kitchen when my mother heard a voice calling her name from the bottom of the stairs.The voice was  _  but that was impossible since the only other person in the house was her brother.That was followed by footsteps  coming up  the stairs to the top room.A few hours  _  her brother came up to see what she was doing.She asked him who the girl on the stairs was.He said there was no one in the house. A few weeks later the  _  event happened.My grandmother was cooking supper in the kitchen.She turned around and two of the chairs were  pulled out  .She pushed them in and went back  _  .About ten minutes later she turned around and three of the chairs were pulled out.My grandmother was quite  _  by this because only my mother's little sister was home at the time. The last event at the house was the  _  and the one that made them move away.Her elder sister Josie was babysitting her younger one,Sarah,when there was a knock on the door.Josie went to  _  it and no one was there.She went to the  kitchen  for some water and when she returned to the living room,Sarah was  _  !She ran all over the house and  in the end  found Sarah sleeping in her bed.This was  _  because Sarah couldn't  _  the stairs without help because they were very steep.This frightened her so she woke up Sarah and  _  her downstairs.Then the phone rang.It was my grandma  _  to say that my grandfather had died and she wouldn't be coming home that night.She was about to turn on the TV  _  she heard a woman's footsteps coming towards her.She turned around but nobody was there.",
