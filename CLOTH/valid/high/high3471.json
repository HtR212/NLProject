    "article": "Education from My Father\nMy memories of my father are slim because he was so sick in the last years of his life. But there are     _    that I am often reminded of and which may have had some bearing on my love of     _  .\nWhen I was small I was somewhat     _    of lightning and thunder. My father explained it. The explanation was in     _     that a child could understand but was basically correct. I gained a better     _    later, but I didn't have to unlearn anything.\nWhat he said was that there was electricity in the clouds     _    it travelled to the ground like a spark. When it travelled     _    the air it made the air so hot that it     _  . Then there was nothing where the air had been and the air all around rushed in to    _    the space. He clapped his hands together very loud,    _    to be the air rushing in, and said that makes the thunder. When I hear thunder, I can still hear that    _  .\nHe explained why if it was cloudy in the winter the night was warmer than if it was     _  .    It was one of those nights when the sky was full of stars: no moon, no town lights. But there were more stars than you could    _    and they had color1 too. He said that if there were no clouds, we had no blankets and were     _     to the universe. Our warmth was going to     _     the whole universe. When there were clouds, they were like blankets and we were not exposed to the universe. I    _    feel on the edge of space on a very clear night.\nI am sure there were many other lessons that I     _    but no longer remember. What I did     _  , in general, was that there were explanations and that the more I understood them, the more comfortable the world was to live in. I was not taught that there were     _    but that there was understanding if you looked for it. This may be why I have always been     _    in science.",
