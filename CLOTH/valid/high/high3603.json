Perhaps some can hack it for about two or three years and then they want to either go back home or move on to another country. As for me, I cannot get  _  of this place. I love it here so much and I honestly believe that I am very comfortable here. It feels just like  _  . And, here  _  the story. It was August 2001 and I had just said  _  to my family and friends as I  _  to Los Angeles International Airport to catch my  _  to Incheon, South Korea which would then  _  me to Beijing. When I arrived in LA I was very excited and a little  _  because I didn't know what to  _  when I arrived in China. It  _  like receiving a wrapped gift and you had no idea what was in it  _  you opened it. As I  _  the Korean Airlines  _  desk I gave the attendant my ticket. He looked at me and said, \"I'm sorry, sir. This flight was yesterday.\" I was in  _  and lost for words. The attendant told me I had to wait several hours until they could  _  whether I could get onto another flight. I was so afraid at this time that I called my mother and frantically told her,\" I missed my flight! I don't think I can go to  China  ! I'm better off going back to Washington, DC!\" That's when she  _  I call my leader in China and ask whether I could still go there. Looking  _  all of the papers I found a phone number and called the Beijing office.  _  , my leader was there and assured me I could still join the group. Also, KAL had a seat for me on the next flight. So, after 24 hours and a  _  in Korea, I arrived in Beijing. I don't know what my feeling was, but I wasn't tired because I had finally arrived and I just wanted to look around the city. As I traveled to the hotel in the car I saw all the wonderful buildings, friendly people and interesting sites. I was so happy to be here.",
