When Dad first   gave up  drinking, the whole family was on pins and needles every time he got into a   _  that, in the past, would have started him   _  again. For a few years we were    _  to bring it up for fear that the drinking would begin again.\n    \"I had this little poem that I would recite to myself at least four to five times a day,\" was Dad's   _  to my 18-year-old unasked question. \"The words were a constant   _  to me that things were   _  so hard that I could not deal with them,\" Dad said. Then he   _   the poem with me. The poem's   _  , yet profound   words immediately became   _    of my daily routine as well.  \n    About a month after this   _  with my father, I received a gift in the mail from a friend of mine. It was a book of daily sayings of wisdom with one   _  for each day of the year.\n    It has been my   _  that when you get something with days of the year on it, you naturally turn to the page that lists your own   _   . \n    I   _  opened the book to November 10 to see   _  words of wisdom this book had in store for me. I was   _  when I looked at the page, and then tears of disbelief and appreciation   _  down my face. There, on my birthday, was the exact same poem that had  _    my father for all these years! It is called the Serenity   Prayer:\nGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; the courage to change the things I can; and the wisdom to know the difference.",
