    "article": "How many licks   does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop  ?\nThe first time I heard this in the Tootsie Pop commercial, I was five years old. I immediately started   _   and counting. After about two hundred licks or so, I stopped. The   _   of the chewy center had proven to be too great, and I   _   my way through the hard shell   to the very center. Besides, I   _   knew how many licks it took to get to the center--three. That's how many licks it took the owl   in the commercial to get to the center, so that, to me, was the   _   answer.\nIn high school, I held to the Tootsie Pop   _  . To me, the answer was still always three licks.\nIn my freshman year, I joined the Model United Nations 42 _  in my school. The Chair position had   _   the center of the Tootsie Pop and my   _   had become various other students. The first so-called \"owl\" was Eric who had luckily   _   the prestigious   Chair position. So, I decided,   _   Eric reached the center in only one lick, that's how many licks it should take me. I went to the tryouts with a view to obtaining the position but   _  .\nAt the end of my sophomore   year, a new owl named Iris had   _   achieved the chair position after trying twice. I began working hard again. But then again, I did not make a   _   of it. \nNow, slightly frustrated after   going through   two owls, I found a new owl, Evan. It had taken him three licks to get to the \"center\". Three was all I could   _  . It was widely known that senior year was the   _   year to become Chair. I thought about   _   the program, but on second thoughts, I decided to continue. \nEleven years later, I visited the official Tootsie Pop website to find the real answer to the question that had   _   me my entire high school life. I finally understood. However many licks it takes to get to the center of the Tootsie Pop depends on however many licks I   _   to take--not how many the other owls take.",
