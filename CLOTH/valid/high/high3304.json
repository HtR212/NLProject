Success does not  _  every person, just like the sun doesn't shine every day. Do you give up your plan to go hiking  _  because the weather isn't as good as you had hoped? No, of course not. I would rather go on trying no matter what I  _  and enjoy on the way to my destination .  _  failure is like a naughty boy who plays with us on the way to our goals. Not only does he want to  _  us, but he wants to help us become braver. The more we  _  , the braver we'll be. If failure is the  _  without the moon, I'll still smile at it, as stars may twinkle on us still.  Of course  , we all like the moon, but should we ignore the stars? There is always something more important than  _  . In other words, we shouldn't only  _  on whether we succeed or fail. In fact, we learn a lot from failure. It is really helpful. The more we learn from failure, the  _  we'll be. If failure is a bird without  _  , I'll still smile at it. Flying isn't the only thing a bird can do.

We may fail in one area, but we may  _  in another. Maybe we'll find that we have a talent for something we never knew about before. Who  _  ?
