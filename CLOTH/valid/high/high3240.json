    "article": "In January 2013, Sam Bloom was on a family holiday with husband, Cameron and their three young boys. After a morning   _   in the sea they discovered the hotel had a rooftop platform and all went up the   _   to enjoy their surroundings. Suddenly Cameron heard a tremendous crash. He   _   around and Sam was gone--as was the safety rail she had been   _   against. Sam fell into a deep depression after the fall from the roof left her paralyzed from the chest down. Doctors said she could never walk again.\nThree months later, as they were heading home from Sam's parents, Noah, her middle son,   _   a baby bird that had fallen to the ground. So they   _   it up and took it home. They called her Penguin because she looked like a penguin. She was just very   _   at two or three weeks old, She would have to be fed every two hours, but they decided rescuing this little bird would be a   _   thing to do together.\nPenguin brought joy back to the family. Sam loved having Penguin around because she was like   _  . Penguin would rest on Sam's lap or on her shoulder, Sam could finally   _   herself without feeling guilty--she would talk to Penguin; she would   _   to her behind Cameron and tell her how she was feeling. Some morning Penguin would just run down the hall and jump up into bed,   _   her way into the quilt and then roll over and sleep. Penguin had some   _  --she was not toilet-trained, and the house got quite messy. As she grew older. Penguin did sleep outside, but at six o'clock in the morning she'd be at the door, with a special   _   that meant, \"Let me in\"!\nAs her   _   grew, Penguin stayed away for longer periods. When she was a year old, she disappeared for six weeks. But on the little son's 13thbirthday, Penguin made a   _   visit. A year ago, she left again and hasn't been seen   _  . The bird has found her freedom and Sam has a freedom of her own. Sam made a new   _  --she took up boating and even made the Australia Para-boating Team. She was out of the   _   and in the water and back in nature.\nOver the two years, Cameron took about 14,000 pictures of Penguin, which have been collected in a book calledPenguin Bloom, Penguin rescued the family as much as they rescued her. Sam got   _   it, thanks to her family, exercise and yes, the friendship of a bird. Angels come in all shapes and sizes!",
