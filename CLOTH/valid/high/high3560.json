    "article": "Recent studies have shown that children with learning disabilities (LD) often have problems. For many, strong    _  of anger,\nshame, sadness, or disappointment can  _  psychological difficulties\nsuch as anxiety, depression or low self-esteem. These problems can be far more\nthan the  _  challenges themselves.\nSeveral heading experts in the field of LD have offered suggestions on ways to help   _  children from these problems.\nTo be most effective in supporting   _  , it can help to\nunderstand some primary  _  for the psychological and\nemotional challenges they may face.\nFirst, it is not difficult to see    _  children\nwith LD are at greater risk for developing psychological difficulties if one\nconsiders the repeated failure they  _  . Although they make efforts\nto \"try harder,\" children with LD may receive little  _  feedback . Their academic struggles and failures are often met with   _  by teachers, peers and parents.\nSuch disapproval can take the form of unpleasant labeling of a child   _  \"slow,\"\n\"lazy\" or \"dumb.\"  Instead of  developing a sense of pride in their\naccomplishments, children with LD may  end up  in disappointment\nand shame. Low self-esteem and a lack of confidence only  _  prevent learning and academic success.\nThe second reason is the   _  difficulties they often\nexperience. Research indicates that as many as 75% of kids with LD have\nsuch  _  as making and keeping friends. Children with LD are less  _  and often rejected by their peers. Teachers and other adults also\nmay  _  to have negative views of them. Such social rejection can result in    _  of self-esteem and feelings of loneliness, which,  in turn  may\nlead to psychological difficulties such as anxiety and depression.",
