    "article": "In Glasgow, , a young lady, like a lot of teens today, got tired of home. The daughter objected to her family's  _  lifestyle and said, \"I don't want your God. I am leaving !\" She left home. Before long, she was disappointed and unable to find a job, so she took to the streets to do everything she could to  _  money. Many years passed by, her father died , her mother grew  _  , and the daughter became more and more entrenched in her way of life. No contact was made between mother and daughter during these years. The mother, having  heard of  her daughter's whereabouts, went to the poor part of the city in  _  of her daughter . She stopped at each of the rescue missions with a simple  _  . \"Would you allow me to  put up  this picture?\" It was a picture of the smiling, gray-haired mother with a handwritten  message  at the bottom : \"I love you still...come home!\" One day the daughter wandered into a rescue mission for a hot meal. She sat  _  listening to the service, all the while letting her  _  wander over to the bulletin board. There she saw the picture and thought, could that be my mother? She couldn't  _  until the service was over. She stood and went to look .It was her mother , and there were those words, \"I love you still...come home !\"  _  she stood in front of the picture, she wept. It was too  _  to be true. It was night, but she was so  _  by the message that she started walking home.  _  the time she arrived it was early in the morning. She was afraid and  _  her way timidly. As she knocked, the door  _  open on its own. She thought someone must have broken into the house. Concerned for her mother's    , the young woman ran to the bedroom and shook her mother awake and said, \"It's me ! It's me ! I'm home!\" The mother couldn't believe her eyes. They fell into each other's arms. The daughter said , \"I was so worried and  _  someone had broken in.\" The mother replied gently, \"No, dear . From the day you left, that door has never been  _  .\"",
