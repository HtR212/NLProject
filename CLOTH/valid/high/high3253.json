    "article": "When I was in junior high, the eighth-grade bully  hit me in the stomach. Not only did it hurt and make me angry, but the   _   and shame were almost unbearable. I wanted  _   to even the score! I planned to meet him on the playground the next day and let him   _   it.  \nFor some reason, I told my plan to Nana, my   _  . Surprisingly, she gave me one of her hour-long lectures. Among the many things she told, I unclearly remembered her telling me that I didn't need to   _   about him. She said, \"Good deeds   bring about   good results, and evil deeds lead to bad results.\" I told her, in a nice way, of course, that I thought she was full of it. I told her that I did good things all the time, but all I got   in return   was \"Rubbish!\" \nIt took me 30 years to understand the   _   of her words. Nana was living in a board-and-care home in Laguna Hills, California. Each Tuesday, I   came by   and took her out to dinner by car. I would always find her neatly   _   sitting in a wheel-chair right by the front door. I clearly remember our very last dinner together before she left there. We   _   to a nearby simple little family-owned restaurant. I   _   pot roast for Nana and a hamburger for myself. The food   _   and as I dug in, I noticed that Nana wasn't eating, but staring at the food on her plate.  _   my plate aside, I took Nana's plate to my side and cut her meat into small pieces. I then   _   the plate back in front of her. As she   _   the meat into her mouth very weakly, and with great difficulty, I was struck with a memory that brought   _   tears to my eyes. Forty years   _   , when I was a little boy, Nana had always cut the meat into small pieces so I could eat it. \nIt had taken 40 years, but the good deed had been   _  . Nana was right. \"Every good deed you do will someday come back to you.\" We   _   exactly what we sow.",
