It said, \"I am here. I am down safely. I am beginning my work. \" The message  _  at the speed of light. It took twenty minutes to reach the earth, more than three hundred and twenty million kilometers  _  . Scientists and engineers at the control center  _  . Moments later, television receiver in the control center began to  _  the first picture from Viking One. People at the center could see the feet of the landing craft sitting firmly on the  _  soil of Mars. Those pictures were our first  _  look at the planet.
