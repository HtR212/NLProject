Trying to get out of the  _  , the couple went to the front desk hoping to  _  for the night.\n\"Could you  _  give us a room here?\" the husband asked.\nThe clerk, a  _  man with a winning smile, looked at the couple and  _  that there were three conventions  in town.\n\"All of our  _  are taken,\" the clerk said. \"But I can't send a  _  couple like you  _  into the rain at 1 o'clock in the morning. Would you please be  _  to sleep in my room? It's not exactly a suite , but it will be good enough to make you  _  for the night.\"\nThe couple said no politely.\n\"Don't  worry about  me. It is just fine with me,\" the clerk told them.\nAs he paid his bill the next morning, the elderly man said to the clerk, \"You are the kind of manager who should be the boss of the best hotel. Maybe someday I'll build  _  for you.\" The three of them had a good  _  .\nTwo years passed. The clerk had almost forgotten it  _  he received a letter from the old man. It recalled  that stormy night and contained a round-trip   _  to New York, asking the young man to pay them a visit. The old man met him in New York, and  _  him to the corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street.\nHe then pointed to a great new  _  there, a palace of reddish stone. \"That,\" said the old man, \"is the hotel I have just built for you to  _  .\"\n\"You must be  _  ,\" the young man said.\n\"I am sure I am not,\" said the old man, the name of  _  was William Waldorf Astor, and the magnificent structure was the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The young clerk, George C. Bolt became its first manager.",
