One day, as I went to sleep after my sisters and I had said our prayers, I recalled the events of the day and how  _  I had behaved toward Mother.\"I must make things right now,\"I thought. Quietly I  _  out of bed and picked up the pencil and paper from the dresser, and then tiptoed into the hall.The  _  from the living room shone dimly. I knew Mother was downstairs still doing some sewing. I quickly  _  a note asking Mother to excuse me for being so  _  .I didn't want my sisters to know my  _  so I added a postscript, \"Please don't let anyone else see this.\" Then I  _  moved into my parents'bedroom and put the letter under Mother's pillow. The next morning when I  _  my bed after breakfast, I  _  found a return note under my pillow.Mother wrote that she loved me and  _  me.This became my way of  _  whenever I talked back or disobeyed.Mother always left a return note, but she never  spoke about  our under-the-pillow messages in front of the family.Even when we were  _  , she never mentioned them when we sisters  _  our childhood. When Mother passed away, I had to go through her personal belongings.In her desk was a bundle of notes tied with a faded ribbon.On top was a message in handwriting which read,\"In the event of my death, please  _  these.\" I  turned over  the package and glanced at the handwriting on the bottom.To my  _  , I recognized my childish writing, \"P.S.Please don't let anyone else see this.Love, Edie.\"I gently placed the unopened bundle in the  _  along with other things for the rubbish burner.\"Lord,\"I prayed,\"Make me like  Mother  .\"",
