Remembering that I'll be  _  soon is the most important tool to help me make the big choices in life,  _  almost everything--all expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--just falls away in the face of death,  _  only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to  _  . You are already naked.There is no reason not to follow your heart. No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to  _  don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever  _  it, because Death is very likely to be the single best invention of Life. It clears out the old to  make way  for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will  _  become the old and be cleared away. Your time is  _  , so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice.Everything else is secondary.",
