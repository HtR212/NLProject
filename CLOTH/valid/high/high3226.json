    "article": "Five months after my husband Steve died, I woke up one morning to the maddening sound of a leaking faucet . I knew it needed repairs badly, but it  _  me so much just to think of it. All our  _  life, I was the \"artist\" bringing to our house much imagination. Steve was the\"  _  \" one. He had a real gift for handling chores ,  _  me from unpleasant repair jobs. But how could such a good man have his life cut short so suddenly! I had been so sad and angry that I completely  _  the house. That leaky faucet somehow awakened me to the fact that I now had to  face up with  the challenge of getting things fixed. I got a workman named Ahmed. Entering the house, he stopped before a picture of Steve and me. \"Doesn't your husband  _  this kind of work?\" he asked. \"It's not hard.\" \"He died months ago. When he was alive, he did all the repair jobs  _  .\" I said quietly. Ahmed looked at me  _  , but he didn't reply. He fixed the faucet, adjusted the dishwasher door, and replaced a showerhead. Apparently he was gifted as Steve had been. He did a(n)  _  job. I asked him to name his fee. \"No charge, Ma'am,\" he said. \"My father died early, and the neighbors helped my family through.\" By fixing a faucet, Ahmed mended my soul. Although I would sure carry the pain of  _  with me along, Ahmed reminded me of the abundant  _  in the world.",
