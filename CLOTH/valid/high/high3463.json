My health book paints a pretty picture of the rest home, describing it as a home where family members and the sick can work together in     _   incurable  illnesses. It shows pictures of   _   patients speaking to doctors, with   of course   loving ones around them.\nThat's   _   what a rest home is. There aren't family members, only cards sent occasionally during the year. The   _   I help hardly smile because they're fighting to   _   where they are, what year it is, even their own   _   .\nAnd they don't like the \"old people\" smell -- the smell of disease, of medicine and sweat, or of the loss of self-respect. They don't like it. But they   live in   it.\nNext week is my   _   . I'm moving soon and I won't have to smell that rest home. I won't have to   _   a woman who can't even close her mouth, or calm a man who's crying because he can't stop shaking  long enough    to tie his shoes. I won't have to run   _    a nurse when Evelyn falls out of her wheelchair.\nBut I feel far from  _   . After four years of volunteering, the place is the same as the day I started. All the   _   keeps fresh, never to be cut through by youthful spirits.\n  _  visit. Some brings cake and puppy dogs and flowers.    _   only some. When you were born, loving arms held you. Shouldn't you  _   that way too? Shouldn't the elderly, who've lived their lives, raised their children and contributed to society...Shouldn't they end feeling     _  ? Why don't they?",
