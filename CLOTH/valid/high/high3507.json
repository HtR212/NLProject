He's been the heart and soul of the office for a couple of years combining  _  professional skills with a sweet and gentle nature.\nAnd now he's moving on to an exciting new professional  _  . It sounds like it could be the chance of a lifetime, and we're  _  for him. But that doesn't make it any easier to say goodbye to him.\nLife has a way of throwing these curve  balls  _  us. Just when we start to get comfortable with a person, a place or a situation, something comes along to  _  the recipe.\nOur ability to cope with change  _  to a great degree, our peace, happiness and contentment in life.\nBut how do we do that? A friend of mine is fond of reminding us that \"survivability depends upon  _  .\" And then there's Chris the California surf-rat, who once told me that the answer to life's problems can be  summed up  in four words: \"Go with the flow.\"\nI'm not exactly sure, but I think Chris was saying that life is a series of  _  --both good and bad. No matter how excellent your skill, there will always be life-influencing factors over which you have no  _  . The truly successful person expects the unexpected, and is prepared to  _  adjustments if the need should arise--as it almost  _  does.\nThat doesn't mean you don't keep trying to make all your  _  come true. It just means that when things come up that aren't  _  in your plan, you work around them--and then you move on.\n\"Change, indeed, is painful,  _  ever needful,\" said philosopher Thomas Carlyle. \"And if memory has its force and worth, so also has  _  .\"\nWe're going to miss Jack. But rather than stay on the  _  of our parting, we'll focus on our hopes for a brighter future--for him, and for us. And then we'll go out and  _  everything we can to make that future happen.  _  our plans change--again.",
