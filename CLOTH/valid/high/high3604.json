In my memory, my mother36 _ seemed to be able to say the magic37 _ ,\"I'm sorry.\"She felt them, I'm certain, but just didn't say them.\nI've been sorry all my life.38 _ you step on my toe, I'll say I'm sorry I got in your39 _ . No matter how sorry you say you are, I will be sorrier.\nWhen we40 own up to our mistakes, several things happen. First, it ends the41 _ argument of who's to blame. Also, it makes the other person feel a little better. Not42 _ better, maybe, but a little. Finally, best of all, it opens the door to grace.43 _ blooms in the heart of the one who's wronged, but it's44 _ by the one who says\"I'm sorry.\"\n45 _ , I lost my cell phone and I spent all day searching for it, ripping my purse, my car, my house and even my hair apart, but46 in vain . How could I have been so47 _ ? Finally, I called my husband at work.\n\"I lost my phone,\"I said,\"and I feel like such an idiot.\"\n\"I'll call it,\"he said. Then he48 _ .\"Oh, wait. I've got it. Guess I, uh, picked it up49 by mistake this morning.\"\nFor a moment, I50 _ about killing him in his sleep. But he was sorry, sort of. So I forgave him. It wasn't his fault. And it wasn't mine.\nI told you all that to say this: Life is51 _ . We waste precious time blaming others for things that are no one's fault, when we long to forgive and be forgiven.\nIf you need to say you're sorry, say it52 _ . If you need to forgive, do it now. Don't beat yourself up over things that can't be53 _ . Let go of old hurts. Don't let them keep hurting you. As the ancient poet Rumi put it,\"The54 _ is the place where the Light enters you.\"\nKeep the scar, welcome the Light, but55 _ the pain. If you need someone to blame, blame me. I promise I'll be sorry.",
