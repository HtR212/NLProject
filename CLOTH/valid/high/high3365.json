Little did I know you were   _  every penny you earned to go to  _  school.\nI cannot thank you enough for  _  you told me one autumn afternoon when I was nine. After finishing my homework. I went into the living room where you were buried  _  piles of law books. I was   _  .Why were you doing what I do--memorizing textbooks and studying for   _  ? When you said you were in law school, I was more puzzled. I didn't know. \"Moms  could   be lawyers, too.\" you smiled and said, \"In life, you can do anything you want to do.\"\nYoung as I was, that statement kept   _  in my ears. I watched as you faced the  _   of completing your studies, while still being a   _  and a Mom of five kids. I was exhausted just watching you   in action  .With your words of wisdom in my   _   mind, I suddenly felt unlimited freedom to dream. My whole world   opened up  .I set out to live my life filled with  _  , seeing endless possibilities for personal and professional achievements.\nYour words became my motto. I  _  found myself in the unique position of being either the first woman doctor in Maryland Rotary  _  one of the few women chief medical reporters in my field. I gained strength every time I said, \"Yes, I'll try that.\"\n  _  by your statement, I have forged ahead   with my life's journey, less afraid to make mistakes, and   _  meeting each challenge. You did it, and now I'm   _   it. So much to do. So many dreams to live.",
