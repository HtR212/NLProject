    "article": "One day my 5-year-old daughter, Mini, ran to the window crying: \"A Cabuliwallah! A Cabuliwallah !\" In the street below was a Cbuliwallah,  _  slowly along. Mini called him loudly but when he looked at her,she ran away,  _  . Shortly after this, the two became friends. They started to  hang out  together, laughing and talking. Mini's new friend would give her sweets and nuts,  _  the little money he had on her.The Cabuliwallah, called Rahmum, would joke: \"Well, little one, when are you going to the father-in-law's house?\" Mini did not understand this and was  _  . One morning, I heard noise in the street, and saw Rahmum being led  _  by the police. There were bloodstains on his clothes. I gathered that a neighbor had  _  Rahmum money for a shawl but had falsely  _  having bought it, and that in the course of the quarrel Rahmum had struck him. On a charge of murderous attack, Rahmum was  _  to jail. Time passed, and he was not remembered. Mini grew up and we were making  _  for her wedding. I was sitting in my study when someone entered. It was Rahmum,  _  from prison.  _  recognizable now, he asked to see Mini and said that all those years ago she had  _  him of his own daughter in Kabul. It was his belief that Mini was still the same. He had  _  her running to him calling \"Cabuliwallah!\". He had imagined that they would laugh and talk together. In fact, he had brought her,  wrapped up  in paper, a few nuts and grapes. The two were  _  but Mini had grown up. She now understood the meaning of the word \"father-in-law,\" and when he made this joke once more she was  _  in the face at the question. He could not revive their old friendship. When Rahmum left, I gave him a bank note, saying:\"Go back to your own daughter, and  _  the happiness of your meeting bring good fortune to my child! \" Having made this present, I had to  give up  the electric lights and the military band I had  _  for the wedding and the ladies in the house were disappointed. But to me the wedding feast was all the brighter for the thought that in a distant land a long-lost father met again with his child.",
