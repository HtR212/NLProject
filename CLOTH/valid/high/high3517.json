    "article": "I lived next door to Debbie and her 84-year-old mother, Nan, for about six months. One night last summer, Debbie asked me to check on her mother because she worked the overnight shift   at a nursing home.\nI was glad to help. But I  _  felt a little funny about it.  After all  , I've been blind since I was a baby and out of  _  for years. In fact, at 54, I came to wonder if I had any  _  to live.\nA bit after 9:00 pm, I heard a sound--over the years my ears have grown super  _  . It was Nan. \"Jim, Jim. The house is  on fire  ! Help!\"\nI went as far as I could to Debbie's. I got to the front door,  _  for the key and unlocked the door. \"Nan! Where are you?\" I called.\n\"Here, Jim. Help!\" her voice was  _  and low.\nI felt my  _  inside. \"Nan, where are you? Keep  _  !\" \"Here, Jim, here!\" sounds as if she's  _   in the sweet, fresh summer air.\nLater the fire truck arrived. Debbie came too. Nan and I heard the sound of the  _  coming down. Finally, the firefighters  _  the fire.\nI heard Nan crying. She said, \"I was so  put out  and got turned around. I couldn't find the door. You saved my life.\"\nNow Debbie's voice quivered  , \"You're a hero. You rescued my mom.\"\nI hardly knew what to say. Two hours earlier I was wondering whether I really mattered to anyone. And now I saved a life. Nan and Debbie were thanking me. Truth was, I wanted to thank them. Nan wasn't the only one who had been saved that day.",
