They are popular with the opposite sex. They are good-looking and people want to  _  their style. They can do their homework but they don't make a big effort. That would not be cool. The  _  kids are in the other corner of the playground. They are very bright, but they don't have great  _  skills, not popular with the opposite sex and they are  _  at sports.
