I thought it was a good opportunity to  _  my 7 year old son's room and  deal with  some toys that were no longer suitable for him to play with. We  _  that all the money we got from selling the toys would be his money. The night before the  _  ,we loaded up the truck with toys and a little bike that was too  _  for him. In the yard he  _  the bike for the last time and then happily put it onto the truck. This little bike had at least two previous owners as far as we  _  .It wasn't in the best  _  and was certainly not new,but the tires were  _  good. We put a price of $10 on it,but it didn't sell. So,after the sale was  _  ,my friend put it on the sidewalk with a sign that  _  \"FREE,BIKE\". Within five minutes her doorbell rang. A little boy was  _  there. In poor English he asked whether the bike was  _  free. She said yes and that he could have it for  _  He smiled,got on the bike and rode away. Later that evening when I told my son how much money he had made at the sale,he was very  _  ,shouting happily. He asked about a few of his things,wondering  _  they had been sold. When he asked about the bike,I told him about the little boy and that made him  _  .He was much happier than when I told him how much he had  _  .He was so happy to  _  that someone else would make good  _  of that little bike!",
