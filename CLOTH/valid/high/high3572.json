    "article": "Dear son, The day that you see me old and I am already not in good health, have patience and try to understand me. If I get dirty when eating, if I can not dress, have patience and remember the hours I  _  teaching it to you. If, when I speak to you, I  _  the same things thousand and one times, do not  _  me, listen to me. When you were small, I had to read to you thousand and one times the same story  _  you got to sleep. When I do not want to have a  _  , neither shame me nor scold me. Remember when I had to chase you with thousand excuses I  _  , in order that you wanted to bathe. When you see my  _  little about new technologies, give me the necessary time and do not look at me with your mocking smile. I taught you  _  to do so many things: to eat food, to dress well, to confront life.... When at some moment I lose the memory or the  _  of our conversation, let me have the necessary time to remember, and if I cannot do it, do not become nervous, as the most important thing is not our conversation but surely to be with you and to have you  _  to me. If ever I do not want to eat, do not force me. I know well  _  I need to and when not. When my  _  legs do not allow me to walk, give me your  _  , the same way I did when you gave your first  _  . And when someday I say to you that I do not want to  _  any more ---- that I want to rest forever, do not get  _  . Someday you will understand. Try to understand that my age is not lived but survived. Some day you will discover that, despite my mistakes, I always wanted the  _  thing for you and that I tried to prepare the way for you. You must not feel sad, angry or impotent for seeing me  _  you. You must be next to me, try to understand me and to help me as I did it when you  _  living. Help me to walk, help me to end my way with love and  _  . I will pay you by a smile and by the immense love I have had always for you. I love you, Son Your father",
