She enjoyed sitting on her front porch in her 41 _ and, on this day, she watched her son 42 _ his car. He raised it on blocks of wood, removed the tires and 43 _ on his back underneath the vehicle.\n44 _ there was a loud crack and the car lurched  to one side, pinning the young man underneath. She 45 _ for her husband who ran to assist, but he couldn't 46 _ the car or the young man. He climbed into his own vehicle and sped away for 47 _ .\nThe mother, who hadn't 48 _ in months, realized that her son's groans  were growing 49 _ and she knew that it would be up to her to 50 _ the boy. She rose to her feet and walked on 51 _ legs to the car. Supporting herself, she 52 _ the car. The car rose a few inches -- just enough to let the boy get 53 _ . Then she collapsed.\nAfter a thorough 54 _ , she was found only to have suffered strained muscles. And the 55 _ doctor's words were most telling: \"I will always wonder,\" he said, \"how far she might have lifted that car if she had been 56 _ and strong.\"\nWe've read similar stories about persons exhibiting almost super-human 57 _ in times of crises. This mother, and others like her, found the strength they needed to 58 _ the crisis at hand.\nAnd so it is with all of us. When life 59 _ us down and it seems impossible to get back up, we need to find a way to do what needs to be done. We are 60 _ than we think.",
