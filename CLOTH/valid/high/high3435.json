    "article": "My Fellow Americans, I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be suffered from Alzheimer's Disease . Upon learning this news, Nancy & I had to decide whether as private citizens we would  _  this a private matter or we would make this news known in a  _  way. In the past Nancy suffered from breast cancer  _  I had my cancer surgeries . We found that after we told it to the public, we were able to  _  public awareness . We were happy that  as a result  many more people went to have a test. They were treated in early stages and able to  _  to normal, healthy lives. So now, we feel it is  _  to share it with you. In opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater  _  of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are  _  by it. At the moment I feel just fine. I'd  _  to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the things I have  _  done. I will continue to share  _  journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy the great outdoors and stay in touch  _  my friends and supporters. Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's Disease  _  , the family often suffers a lot. I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this  _  experience. When the time comes I am confident that with your help she will  _  it with faith and courage. At last, let me thank you, the American people for giving me the great honor of  _  me to serve as your President. When the Lord calls me home,  _  that may be, I will leave with the greatest love for this country of ours and endless optimism for its future. I now begin this  _  that will lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for America there will always be a bright  _  ahead. Thank you my friends. May God always bless you. Sincerely, Ronald Reagan",
