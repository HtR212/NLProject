But it may well be that the learning you really want   _  somewhere else instead. I had the   _  of seeing this first hand on a   _  \nMy daughter plays on a recreational  soccer team. They did very well this season  and so   _   a tournament , which normally was only for more skilled  club teams. This led to some   _   experiences on Saturday as they played against teams   _   trained. Through the first two games, her   _   did not get on serious shot on goal. Clearly, I   _   seeing my daughter playing her best,   _   still defeated .\nIt seemed that something happened to the   _   between Saturday and Sunday. When they   showed up   for their Sunday game, they were   _   different. They had begun integrate  the kinds of play and teamwork   they had   _   the day before into their   _   .They played much better and   _   scored a goal.\n  _   struck me  that playing against the other team was a great   _   moment for all the girls on the team. I think it is a general principle . Experience is the best   _  . The lessons they learned may not be different from what they would have gotten in school, but are certainly more personal and meaningful, because they had to think them out   _   their own.",
