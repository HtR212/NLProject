    "article": "Average Life Expectancy\nHow long do you expect to live?   That is to say  , what is the average life expectancy for us?\nThe average life expectancy   _   from country to country, but   _   many countries nowadays, the average life expectancy is over 70 years. That   _   the average person will live to be   at least   70 years old.\n  _  , in the United States in 1980, the average life expectancy was 73.8 years. This age, 73.8 years, is a little   _   than the average life expectancy in 1970. In 1970, the average was 70.8. In fact, if you look at the average life expectancy   _   for last century, you'll see that the average   gets higher   every year.   For instance  , in 1900 it was 47.3, in 1920 it was 54.1, in 1940 was 62.9, and in 1960 the average   life time   was 69.7 years.\nSo you can see that in 100 years, the average life expectancy   has risen   from 47.3 to 73.8.\nWhy   _   the average life expectancy   _   increasing? The main reasons are   connected with   health care. First, health care, especially general health care for young children has   _   steadily.\nSecond,   a large number of   drugs have been   _   in the past 40 or 50 years. These powerful drugs can   _   and cure many diseases that   used to be   fatal in the past.",
