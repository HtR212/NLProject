    "article": "\"Who could ever have imagined someone like me would make it this far?\" asked Evan Mercer last week during his high school graduation speech as the best student. Mercer offered  _  to his fellow classmates to never give up---and the words  _  much more to himself. That's because Mercer is deaf, and he told the story of the serious troubles he  _  to graduate first in his class at Harrison High school in Kennesaw, Georgia.\nMercer didn't start to  _  until he was 5, according to his mother, Pam Mercer. Although her son was  _  a disadvantage, she was determined not to treat him  _  . \"I've expected him to do everything every other kid does, and I saw no  _  why he couldn't,\" she told ABC News. \"And if he  _  the first time, we just tried again.\"\nMercer, 18, worked hard throughout school,  _  no special treatment but sitting at the front of the class and using a special audio system so he could hear the teacher. All his hard work  paid off  . He received full school fare to Vanderbilt University. \"Deafness had taught me a lesson to never  give up  ,\" he said in the speech. \"Not when the experts tell you it cannot be done. Not when you have  _  so far behind that escaping seems the only way  _  . Not when achieving your dreams seems an entire  _  .\"\nMercer spoke for about four minutes, after which he received a standing ovation  from the class and  _  messages from family, friends and strangers. \"They've been sending me messages on Facebook, email, they've been talking to me in person telling me how it had a  _  on their lives and how they're really  _  by it,\" Mercer told ABC News. \"It feels  _  . Seeing that my words  _  have a power on someone and that they want to work harder  because of  my words makes me feel wonderful.\"",
