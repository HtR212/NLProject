Every night when the boy returned to his room, sore and13 worn out , feeling his whole day had been spent in vain. Since the boy was showing discouragement, the neighbor said to him, \" You have been pushing14 _ the rock for a long time and it hasn't moved. Thus, the task is impossible and you are a failure.\" These words15 _   the boy very much.\nThen the neighbor16 _ , \"Why do you kill yourself by doing this? Just give the minimum effort and that will be17 _ .\" That is what the boy18 _ to do, but he decided to take his troubled 19 _  to the sage.\n\"Sir,\" he said, \" I have20 _ long and hard, putting all my strength to do what you have asked.21 _ , after all this time, I haven't even22 _  the rock by half a millimeter. What's wrong with me? Why am I 23 _ ?\nThe sage responded, \"My boy, when I asked you to do it and you 24 _  , I told you that your25 _ was to push against the rock with all your strength. Never did I ask you to move it. Your task was to push. Look at yourself; your arms are 26 _  , your back shiny and brown; your hands are callused   from constant      _   .Your abilities now surpass what you 28 used to have. It is 29 _ that you haven't moved the rock. But your task was to push and to 30 _ your faith. You have done a good job.\"",
