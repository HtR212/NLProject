A month ago, while on summer vacation back in my motherland, I learned a lesson from mosquito   bites. Right before   _   Kennedy Airport in New York, my grandma   _   me of the behavior of the native mosquitoes around the   _   like me. She said, \"There's an old saying -- the   _   you stay away from the motherland, the sweeter your blood   _   to the mosquitoes.\" Not   _   it, I replied, \"Grandma, that's just an old wives' tale!\"  \n  Well, less than a week   _   my arrival in Manila, I was already carpeted with a   _   of mosquito bites. I took many measures to keep myself from being   _   , but they all proved useless.\n  Late one   _   in my cousin's home, I couldn't bear the   _   of the bites. Hoping to find some comfort, I   woke up   my cousin, who was sleeping peacefully in the bed next to mine. Unhappy for being   _   she said, \"There is nothing you can do. Go back to sleep.\" With a few turns, she slept again. Enviously     _   her sleep, I hoped a big mosquito would   _   on her face. However, the mosquitoes would just lightly dance around her forehead and fly away quickly, never biting her. Amazed  , I ran to others'   _   , only to find they were all sleeping   _   as the same thing occurred again and again.\n  From those bites, I came to   _   my grandma's silly tale. From then on, I've always tried to keep a(n)   _   mind about those strange old wives' tales   _   they do have some truth to them.",
