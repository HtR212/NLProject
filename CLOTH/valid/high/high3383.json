Speaking of success, Glen often tells us a story about his  _  expensive \"school\" fees. He always owes his success to it.\nAt that time, Glen, who already got a PH Degree, decided to return to the motherland, starting a company. Before   _  , he bought a Rolex watch with the  _  made\nthrough years of work after school and the scholarships. At the airport he had\nto accept the routine customs check. The watch on his wrist was also demanded\nto be  _  down for inspection. Glen knew that\ncarrying the  _  goods out had to pay the tax.\nAnd he worried about paying  _  for his watch. So when\nhe was checked, he told a lie that his watch was a worthless  _  . When he was  _  of his \"smarts\", immediately ,  _  the presence of Glen, the officers hit the watch, which  _  nearly 100,000 yuan into pieces at hearing Glen's words. Glen was\namazed.  _  he understood why, he was taken to the office to\nbe  _  strictly. For many times of entry-exit  _  he knew that only those people in the \"blacklist\" would \"enjoy\" this\nspecial treatment. The officers looked out every thing carefully in the box,\nand warned him  no matter what  time of entry and exit he must\naccept the check and if  found out     reusing and\ncarrying fake and shoddy  goods, he would be charged according to law! Suddenly, his face turned red, and he had nothing in mind after  _  the plane for long.\n    After returning to the homeland, he often told the story to his family, and his employees,\ntoo. He said that this made a deep   _  on him, because an additional high \"school\" fee that\nhe had ever paid made him realize the value of   _  , which he would  _  as a secret of\nhis success forever.",
