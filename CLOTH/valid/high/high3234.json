After my  _  diagnosis, Nom and Dad had driven more than l,200 miles from their home to be with me for three  _  while I was getting over from  _  and chemotherapy . When the cancer returned last, they, once again,  _  it here , too. They waited for hours while I received my treatments------Dad with his  _  and Mom with a magazine. But now, they were  back home  in Westlake. My children are  _  and my four brothers live far from my home outside Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania. I knew  _  of them would come if asked, but I didn't want to  _  them,even with the intense  _  I felt. I  _  picked one of the magazines on the end table beside me and couldn't help wishing my  _  were there inside. One publication caught my  _  , a magazine I liked best and had  _  to ages ago. I couldn't tell you the last time when I'd read an issue. I  _  it up and I started right in with the letters to the  _  \"I love  _  my copy every month,\" the first letter began. The author mentioned a daughter who  _  in Clinton, Pennsylvania. Huh, that's funny. I thought. That's my town!
