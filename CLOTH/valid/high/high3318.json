I noticed That Paul had been reading a(n)  _  book every time I walked by. I thought he must love  _  very much.\nOut of curiosity, I decided to go up and  _  to him. I asked him if he liked books. As I  _  , Paul nodded his head. However, what he said later made me  _  . He said that he had been  _  reading that book for a while.\nI decided to do something for him. That day, I was  _  my Kindle. Without any thought of  _  , I decided to give it to him and teach him how to  _  it. Paul couldn't believe his eyes. He  _  took it. In the following days, I witnessed firsthand how much Paul  _  the product.\nOne day, I took a picture of a  _  in which Paul was reading on his Kindle, and  _  it on Reddit the following day. The  _  photo received 2 million reviews on the Internet. It brought me a lot of  _  to see someone get so much from something I took for granted.\n  _  I left Las Vegas, the Kindle had been already stocked with around 300  _  . And I gave Paul a card with a(n)  _  where he can send the product if he needs more reading materials. To be honest, if I can help someone  pick up  their courage for life in any way, I always try to do my best. Remember, we can not only help ourselves, but also help others.",
