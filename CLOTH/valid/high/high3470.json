During her next appointment,I explained to her the  _  of the problem. She clasped my hand in hers and said,\"I know you're worried about me,but I'm just  _  .\" I thought otherwise.After considerable  _  on my part,and kindness on her part because she wanted to  _  me,she agreed to have me refer her to a cancer surgeon.She saw him,but as I expected,  _  treatment. About six months later she returned to my office,still energetic and  _  . \"How are you?\" I asked. \"I'm just fine,honey,\"she responded  _  high spirits.\"When can I get started on fixing my dentures ?\" Surprised to see her at all,I answered  _  ,\"Let me take a look in your mouth and we'll see about it. \" I couldn't believe my eyes.The cancer that had  _  nearly the entire roof of her mouth was gone--only one small area of redness  _  . I had read of such things happening,but had  _  seen them with my own eyes.That was my first miracle.Since then I've seen many others,because they keep getting  _  to see.In fact,miracles are daily events for me now.And people are a miracle,  _  through them we have a chance to know ourselves and to  _  the miracles of one another. Since my first miracle,I've come to understand that the time and place for a miracle is  _  we choose to find it.",
