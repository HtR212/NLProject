    "article": "Now you're a fool for helping. \"I don't want to get involved\" seems to have become a national motto. One summer I was driving from my hometown of Tahoe City, California to New Orleans, Louisiana. In the middle of the desert, I passed a young man standing by the roadside. He had his  _  out and held a gas can in his other hand. I drove right by him. There was a time  _  you'd be called a jerk for passing by somebody  in need  . Several days later I was still  _  about the hitchhiker , about how I didn't even lift my foot  _  the accelerator for him. \"Does anyone stop any more?\" I wondered. I recalled Blanche DuBois's famous line--\"I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\" Was that  _  these days? One way to test this would be for a person to journey  _  the US without any money, just  _  on the good will of others. What would happen? Would he find food, shelter and support? The idea intrigued me. The week I  _  37, I realized that I had never done something truly crazy.  _  I decided to really do it: travel from the Pacific to the Atlantic without a penny. I would only accept  _  of rides, food and places to sleep. For six weeks I hitched 82 rides and covered 4,223 miles across 14 states. I was treated kindly  _  I went. I was  _  by people's readiness to help a stranger. In Oregon, a house painter named Mike  _  the cold weather and asked if I had a coat. I didn't, so he gave me a big green army-style jacket. A lumber-mill worker in Michigan named Tim invited me to a  _  dinner with his family in their shabby house. Then he offered me a tent. I refused, but Tim insisted, packing it into my bag himself. I found people were generally compassionate. Hearing I had no money and would take none, people bought me food or  _  with them whatever they happened to have. Those who had the  _  to give often gave the most. I'm  _  to all the people I met for their rides, their food, their shelter and their gifts. My faith in ordinary folks was  _  I was proud to live in a country where people were still willing to help. In spite of everything, you can still depend on the  _  of strangers.",
