It was a long  _  road.For several hours he kept on driving.  _  t was almost dark, he saw in a cornfield a tall farmer plowing the land.He stopped his  _  team of horses near the fence and called out, \"Hello, farmer\" \"Hello, yourself\" the farmer replied,  _  plowing. \"Where does this  _  go ?\" \"I haven't ever seen it go anywhere.It always  _  right where it is \" , said the farmer, without stopping his work. \"How far is it  _  the next town?\" said the stranger, speaking a little louder. \"Don't know, never  _  it \" replied the farmer. By this time the city man was getting  _  , \"What do you know? You're the biggest  _  I ever saw\" The farmer  _  the plow and turned and looked for a long time at the city man.Then he said scornfully , \"Maybe I don't know much.  _  I am a fool.But  at least  I'm not lost!\"",
