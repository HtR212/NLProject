One day, his younger sister  _  her son to him, to be taught  _  is so important for deer.The teacher said to the fawn, \"Very well, you can come at this time tomorrow for your first  _  .\" At first, the young deer came to the lessons as he was  _  to.But soon, he became more interested in  _  with the other young bucks .He didn't realize how  _  it could be for a deer who learned  _  but deer games.So he started  cutting classes  .Soon he was escaping school all the time.  _  , one day the fawn who stayed away from school  stepped in  and was trapped.Since he was  _  , his mother got worried.She went to her brother the teacher, and  _  him if her son had learned something.The teacher  _  ,\"My dear sister, your son was disobedient and  _  .Out of respect for you, I  tried my best  to teach him.But he did not want to learn the  _  of deer.He escaped school! How could I possibly teach him?\" Later they heard the sad news.The  _  fawn had been trapped and killed by a hunter.He skinned him and took the meat home to his family. The moral is: Nothing can be learned from a teacher by one who  _  the class.",
