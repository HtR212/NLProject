    "article": "Learning a second language fuels children's intelligence and makes their job prospects brighter.   _  the fact is, in U.S.A, as in many other English speaking countries, speakers of two or more languages are in the  _   . Eighty-four percent of US people are monolingual (speakers of only one language). This leaves a small number who  _  to speak two or more languages.\nNo matter how proud people are of their cultural roots, to speak anything   other than  English is a marker of differencehere. That's why fourteen-year-old Umar is  _  when people comment on the fact that he is able to speak Arabic.\nUmar's mother points out: --In U.S.A, it's not    _  for kids to be bilingual. But, if you speak another language to your children in U.S.A, it is thought that you are not helping them to   fit in  society.\nBut in fact, the general    _  among experts is that learning a second language is good for children. Experts believe that bilinguals - people who speak   _   languages - have a clear learning advantage   _   their monolingual schoolmates. This  _  on how much of each language they can speak, not on which language is used,   _   they are learning Arabic, French, Chinese or any other language.\nVinss Millon, a professor of Foreign Language Training, says: --A lot of studies have   _  that children who speak more than one language sometimes learn one language more  _  , but in the end they do as well as their monolingual schoolmates, and often better, in other subjects.\nThe view is that there is a(n)  _  from the effort of learning another language. A few other  _  agree that \"Bilinguals tend to use language better as a whole. They also  _  greater creativity and problem-solving ability, and\nthey learn further languages more easily\".\nWith all of the benefits, why do we not show more   _  for learning other languages? Parents and teachers   _  in bilingual education say it is pressure from friends at school, general  _   to other languages in English-speaking countries, and problems in the school system that are to blame.",
