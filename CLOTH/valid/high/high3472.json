    "article": "I remember I made my first project--a small table when I was 9 years old. I was so   _   of it that I looked upon it as if I had created a(an)   _  . It was  ly beautiful and it had taken me six weeks to   _   it. I could hardly wait to give it to Mother Winters as a(an)   _  . She was the head mistress of our orphanage , who was always kind but   _   with us. \nAs the tables were not dry from the clear coating , our woodworking teacher told us to wait a few days before taking them to our dormitories. But I was just so   _   and happy that I couldn't wait I dashed out like a   _  , carrying my table, smiling from ear to ear. \nWhen I reached the dormitory I placed the little table beside my bed. I was   _   it when Mother Winters entered. She walked over to the table. Running her hand   _  it, she noticed that it was still wet. \n\"Were you   _   to bring this home?\" she asked. \n\"No, ma'am,\" I   _   with my head down. \nShe ordered me to throw the table out and so I did. After she left, I immediately opened the door to get it back. There was   _   stuck all over. I brushed and cried, but the dirt would not come off. \nI hid the table in my closet and never   _   it. However, a year later during a cleaning-up, it was discovered. Painfully, I had to give the table to Mother Henderson, my houseparent, thinking that she would   _   it away. \nThirty years later at a reunion, I   _   that Mother Henderson was living nearby, so I drove up to see her. We talked cheerfully for long. As I was about to leave, she asked me to come down to her   _   to get something important. I followed her   _  into a dark corner. She picked something up.   _   she turned around, I could see that she was holding a little table. \nMother Henderson kept the little table that I had given up for lost so long ago.\nToday, I look at that table with bittersweet memories but full of   _   to Mother Henderson, who kept the table for a young orphan who   _   it so much.",
