    "article": "My dad always collected coins. He was delighted when the new U.S. state coins were   _   . He would walk to his long-time bankers and make sure they put at least a   _   of new coins aside for him. He gave them to every family member. It gradually became a special family   _   to get coins from Dad.\nWhen my dad   _  ,  I felt such a sense of emptiness. My father and I had been so close. I was lost without his   _   and support. I wondered if I would ever feel my dad around me again,   watching over   me. It was right after Hurricane Katrina and I was doing a motivational meeting for about three hundred volunteers. At the end of the event, I felt so grateful as I looked at these   _   individuals. To my   _  , when I glanced at the floor, I saw nothing   _   a coin, from North Carolina, the state in which my dad was born and   _  .\nThen two months later, I went back to visit my mom. While I was there, I went to the bank to   _   a check. The bank manager, who had known me, called me into her office, showing me the coins for all the states my dad had   _  .\nEver since that time, I have always found coins at the most   _   times, when I needed support the most. Amazingly, nowadays when I need emotional support during a   _   time, a coin will always show up in a(n)  _   place.\nIt has now become a tradition in my family. Every time a coin appears in our house, one of my kids says, \"Oh, it's   _  ! \"We all feel a sense of   _   every time a single coin turns up in an unexpected place. We have all   _   it as a   _   of love, guidance and support from Dad -- and every new coin we find makes us   _  .",
