    "article": "One day, my wife suggested that I should spend some time with my mother. My mother lived alone, but the  _  of my work and my three children made it impossible to visit her  _  . When I  _  to invite her to go out for dinner and a  _  , she was surprised by my  _  request but agreed with  _  in her voice.\nThat Friday after work, while I was  _  over to her house, I was a bit  _  . When arriving, I  _  her waiting in the door with her coat on, appearing to be anxious about our date as well. With her hair curled, she was wearing the dress that she had worn on her last wedding  _  . \"I told my friends that I was going to go out with my son, and they were  _  ,\" she said proudly, as she got into the car.\nWe went to a restaurant that, although not  _  , was very nice and cozy. During the dinner, we had a  _  conversation - nothing extraordinary but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie.\nAs we arrived at her house later, she said firmly, \"I'll go out with you again, but  only if  you let me invite you.\" I agreed.\nA few days later, my mother died of a massive heart attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to do anything for her. Some time later, I received an envelope with a copy of a restaurant  _  from the same place mother and I had dined. An attached note said: \"I paid this bill  in advance  . I wasn't sure that I could be there;  _  , I paid for two plates after all --one for you and the other for your wife. You will never know what that night  _  for me. I love you, son.\"\nAt that moment I understood the  _  of saying, in time, \"I LOVE YOU.\" And to give our loved ones the time they deserve. Because nothing is more important in life than family... and they shouldn't be  put off  until \"some other time.\"",
