    "article": "Lord Nithsdale was put into prison in 1716 because he was against King George I. As a (n)   _   , he was sentenced to death . His wife Winifred couldn't imagine life   _   her husband , so she was   _   to do anything to save him .\nShe was determined to   _   the King and beg him for her husband's life, but the King didn't agree. Winifred refused to   give up   . In desperation, she came up with a more   _   plan. She visited her husband alongside her maid, her friends Mrs. Mills and Mrs. Morgan. Only two visitors at a time were allowed to enter the room. They took advantage of this   _  , going into and out of the room many times to   _   the guards. She also gave the guards money and drink.\n  Once   inside the prison Winifred pulled out some   _   clothes and dressed her husband up as one of the   _  - Mrs. Mills. Mrs. Mills was then brought in, emotional and with her 52 _ buried in her handkerchief.  Lord Nithsdale then was led out by his wife, also holding the handkerchief to his eyes. This was very   _   , or the guards would notice that one of the women had a long   _   ! Fortunately everyone managed to get outside at last.\nWinifred then returned to the room and   _   to be in an emotional conversation with her husband. After a suitable period of time had passed for her husband to leave ,she left the room and got some   _   for herself by telling the guards that her husband was praying   and should not be   _  . This was a clever action as it allowed the   _   to go unnoticed for longer.\nTo complete the clever escape and appear   _   , they gave a tearful goodbye. Lord Nithsdale and his wife   _   and managed to leave the country together.",
