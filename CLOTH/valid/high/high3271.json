We have called for a (n)  _  and are going to fly him to the burn unit in Seattle.\" Seattle was 350 miles from his college, so we knew immediately this was  _  . The doctor described the  _  , which caused the burns. Our son and his friends decided to barbecue hamburgers in the courtyard of their apartment. When they  _  the charcoal , it burst into flames because they had sprayed too much gasoline(petrol). The flames  _  my son's shirt tail and shot from his waist to well over his head.  _  , one of the boys was quick-minded, grasped my son, and  _  him on the grass. While it saved his life, it was not in  _  to save him from severe burns and the terrible scars . After he  _  from the treatments, the doctors told him they would not do plastic surgery for 6 months  _  it takes that long for the skin to stop shrinking and wrinkling . So, he had to return to college with scars typical of severe burns. When I was a child, my mother told my sister, who had a 10-inch, very  _  scar on her arm, \"Nancy, if you ignore the scar, other people will ignore it. It does not mean they will not  _  it, but it means it will not matter to them if it doesn't matter to you.\" I  _  this wisdom on to my son. He took my advice to his  _  and returned to school with his head held high ---- glad he was alive. By the end of the six-month waiting period, he decided that the scars did not  _  , so he made the  _  to give up any plastic surgery. We all have \"scars\" that we believe  _  people to keep away from us. And we spend a lot of time thinking that if only we looked differently, or dressed differently, people would like us better. But you see, people will only judge you by your looks, or your clothes, if you are judging yourself by these same  _  standards. Put your imperfections out of your mind and concentrate on what you value  _  yourself, and your beauty will shine through.",
