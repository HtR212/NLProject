The small three- and four-passenger plane we took so  _  our little boy that he took his favorite blanket and covered his head until we  set down  on the small dirt landing strips. During the months that followed, my son carried his security  _  everywhere. He couldn't fall asleep until he had it. The second year, I had a chance to guest speak in Seattle. While I was  _  for the trip, my son followed me around the room. Fine-tuning my speech in my mind, I was a little distracted. My son seemed most  _  about my having to fly out in bad weather on one of those small planes he  _  so much. I reassured him that I would be  _  . When I got to the hotel in Seattle, I didn't have time to  _  until later that evening, and I was  _  when I opened my luggage and found my son'ssecurity blanket inside. I  _  my wife trying  _  to find the lost blanket as she prepared our son for  _  . I immediately  _  to the phone to call Kathy. When I began to explain that I had no idea how the blanket had  _  been packed, Kathy  _  me down with the news that she already knew where the blanket was. She told me that she had held Nate by the window to let him  _  me drive away from the house. She had suggested that they pray for \"Daddy to have a safe  _  .\" Knowing that our son would be most  afraid of  the small plane ride, she prayed, \"Dear Lord, please help Daddy feel  _  on the little plane.\" When the prayer was over, our son Nate  _  his mom,\"Don't worry, Mom, I gave Daddy my blanket to keep him safe.\"",
