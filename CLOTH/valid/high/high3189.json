Get the  _  !\" Peter, awaking from a deep sleep, thought his wife was only having a  _  dream. \"Stop that noise.\" he said to her. He turned over and tried to go to  _  again, but his wife still cried out, \"Oh, help! Help! I'm sure I'm  _  !\" Peter got out of bed and started  _  , but he could not find him any clothes. \"Where is my shirt?\" he asked. His wife was  _  ill to tell him, and she could only cry, \"Oh, my  _  stomach!\" As soon as he had put his clothes  _  , he said, \"Now, my dear, are you quite  _  that you need the doctor? Surely you can wait  _  morning, can't you?\" \"No, I can't. Go, go, go.\" his wife shouted,\"  _  you will find me dead  _  the morning.\" So Peter went out into the dark street. He had only gone a few meters  _  he heard his wife calling him again. \"I'm  all right  again now, and I shall not want the doctor.\" she said softly. Hearing this, he started running as  _  as he could towards the doctor's. When he arrived there, he knocked at the door loudly enough to wake  everyone  around. The doctor put his sleepy head out of the bedroom window and said, \"Er? Who's there?\" \"Oh, Doctor.\"Peter said to him, \"I've very  _  news for you. My wife  _  ill with a terrible stomachache . I was on my way to bring you to her, but she called me back to say the trouble had suddenly  _  her. So you need not come. Go back to  bed  now, and sleep well!\"",
