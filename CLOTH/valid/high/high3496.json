She was disappointed. \"Maybe the child didn't hear  _  \" she thought. She  _  , \"Laiq, listen carefully. If I give you one apple and one apple and one apple, how many apples will you have?\" Laiq had seen the  _  on his teacher's face. He  _  again on his fingers. But within him he was also  searching for  the answer that would make the teacher happy. This time hesitatingly he replied, \"Four.\" The disappointment stayed on the teacher's face. Suddenly she  _  that Laiq liked strawberries. She thought maybe he didn't like apples and that was why he couldn't answer the question. This time with an excitement in her  _  she asked, \"If I give you one strawberry and one strawberry and one strawberry, then how many will you have?\" Seeing the teacher  _  , young Laiq calculated on his fingers again. There was no pressure on him, but a little on the teacher. She wanted her new  _  to succeed.  _  a hesitating smile young Laiq replied, \"Three?\" The teacher now had a  _  smile. Her way had succeeded. She wanted to  _  herself. But one last thing remained.  Once again  she asked him, \"Now if I give you one apple and one apple and one more apple , how many will you have ?\" Confidently Laiq answered, 'Four!\" The teacher was  _  \"How Laiq , how?\" She demanded in a little annoyed voice. In a  _  and hesitating voice, young Laiq replied, \"Because I already have one  _  in my bag.\" The story tells us:  _  someone gives you an answer that is  _  from what you expect, don't think they are wrong. There shall be an angle that you may not have thought about yet.",
