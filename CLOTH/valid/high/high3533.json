His teacher wrote in a  _  : \"I believe he has ideas about becoming a  _  ; on his present showing this is quite foolish.\" Luckily, the teacher's words didn't  _  Gurdon's love for science. He kept working hard. He went to lab earlier and left  later  than anyone else. On Oct 8, 2012, 64 years later, the British professor  won  the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka had contributed to the research and therefore  _  the award. Gurdon got the honor  because of  his research into cells and cloning. When he was studying at Oxford, he did some  _  on cells. He took a cell from an adult frog, moved its  _  , and put them into an egg cell. The egg cell then  _  into a clone of the adult frog. His research  _  for the first time that every cell in the body contains the same genes. At that time, many people  _  accept Gurdon's idea. But later it helped to  _  Dolly the sheep in 1996, the first cloned mammal in history. It also led to important findings in the  _  use of cells. For example,  _  from someone's skin can turn into any type of tissue in the body. This is good news for those  _  who have diseased or damaged tissue. Gurdon always remembers the  _  he had when he was 15. He even put the report on his desk as a daily  _  to himself. \"When you have  _  , like an experiment doesn't work, it's nice to remind yourself that perhaps you are not so good at your job and the teacher may be  _  ,\" he said. However, the facts suggest Gurdon is pretty good indeed.",
