He would smile and 46 _  her a Merry Christmas.\n              At night the temperature dropped below 0degC, but the Santa Clause 47 _  stood in the cold wind. 48 _  she dropped her coins into his bowl, she handed him a pair of gloves.\n              A week later, a(n) 49 _  Santa Claus was standing there. \"What happened to the other Santa Claus?\" she asked. He told her, \"He's very 50 _  today.\" She prayed for his health.\n              Later that day, a colleague came into her office 51 in tears . \"I don't know what I'm going to do.\" \"What's wrong?\" she asked. \"It's my ex-husband,\" her colleague 52 _ , \"I don't have any money to buy my boys anything for Christmas, 53 _  my ex-husband refuses to send money to them. It breaks my heart that they won't have anything this year.\" The lady 54 _ her colleague, \"I'm sure everything will 55 work out . It's Christmas. Believe in miracles .\"\n              That evening, she told her husband about her colleague's 56 _ , \"I know we don't have much money to 57 _ , but I'd like to give her fifty or a hundred dollars. We'll just get ourselves less this year. Last year we couldn't afford to buy anything for 58 _  but we still had a wonderful Christmas.\" Her husband smiled, \"Give her one hundred dollars. She needs it more than we do.\"\n              She reached up and held him. Warmth spread 59 _  her body. He held her and realized that there really was a Santa Claus - and he had 60 _  her!",
