    "article": "Late one night, a thief crept into a wealthy merchant's house. He was a young thief, without experience. In fact, this was his first professional  _  . So he had  _  everything carefully. All went marvelously well at first. He found, as he  _  , an unlatched window and got into the room easily. But, stepping his way through the  _  room, he stubbed his bare  _  against a table leg. Choking back a cry of pain, terrified of waking the merchant, he hit  himself  on the forehead and called himself a fool. He had  _  to bring a light. In the darkness,  however  , he was able to see an oil lamp on the table, and lit it, then he gave a  _  of relief. As he  picked up  the lamp, a small spider came out from under its  _  . \"Thank you for saving my life,\" said the spider. \"Before he went to bed, the merchant set this lamp down on top of me so I couldn't escape. If you hadn't come along, I wouldn't have  _  the night;  indeed  , I'd have extremely uncomfortable situation for a long time.\" \"You have saved a life and shown compassion , \"the spider went on,  although  the impatient thief said he had not  _  to do so. \"  _  yet, you have done so without the  _  thought or hope of reward. You have gained more merits than you could possibly imagine.\" \"But you're only a spider,\" said the thief. \"And you're only a man.\" said the spider. \"My dear thief, when you understand that  _  is life, whether on eight legs or  two  , you will have understood much. Your deed,  in any case  , has got rid of the bad things from your heart. Go from here with a fresh spirit. And good luck to you.\" The thief did so and never thought to steal again.",
