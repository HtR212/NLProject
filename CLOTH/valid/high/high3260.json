    "article": "I will always remember my first day at the University of Lagos. On arrival at the campus, I was expecting to be met by some tired students(as was practiced in my secondary school),   _  every student around was new like myself. I asked the way to the multi-purpose hall but no one could tell me. I asked a number of questions about issues that   _   me, such as where and how to pay my fees, the way to the dining hall and so on, but no   _   was offered. \"So in the midst of so many people I am all   _  . \"I thought to myself. The prospect was not   _   at all and all the delight I had felt at gaining   _   into a famous university at seventeen began to disappear. \nThen as if   _   by an unknown force, I walked a little bit down the corridor in the direction of a notice board at which some boys and girls were   _  . Because of   _   of something to do, I decided to stop and look at the notice board. Yes! I happened on the   _   to all riddles that had   _   me since I set foot on the campus that morning. On the board there was a big campus   _  , on which I was able to   _   the multi-purpose hall and all the other places. There were   _   details of various activities for freshmen and a comprehensive list of those offered admission into various courses. \nHow enjoyable it was to see the light of knowledge, having been wandering in the darkness of   _  . Even then I was not able to   _   the thought that though I could not be sure how much of the responsibility was mine, the fact that not paying attention to the notice board had   _   contributed to my initial problems. I learnt from that incident an unforgettable   _   which was very useful to me throughout my stay in the university, namely the   _   of reading notice board and handbooks if one is to be well   _   about places and events in the university.",
