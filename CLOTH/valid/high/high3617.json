    "article": "The first event of my life to be printed into my memory occurred when I was three. My mother stands, working in the   kitchen  and then glances at me with a  _  smile. Two\nfeet down the table, I knock on a chair with a bowl and a spoon,  _  my own invisible   powder. We wear   _  dresses, mine the leftover  _  from\nhers, sky blue -- mommy's favorite color1. I am her shadow.\n    However, by 14 I could not   _  my\nmother. All that I heard every day was NO. I wanted to dye my hair and she said\nno. I wanted to  stay out  late with my friends and she said no. I\ndidn't understand why she said no. She was trying to  _  me\nfrom aches and pains and mistakes  _  in her teens. Several\nyears later, I finally understood her, but it was too late. She became ill. I\ncried and  _  , \"Don't take her, God, please! She is my mother, my\nmommy, ma, the woman who gave me life. All my years,  _  the\nhard times and the good, she has been there,  _  to me\nforever by an invisible umbilical cord   that lasts longer after birth.\"But this cord, this love could do nothing to stop the cancer from   _  .\n    A few years later   _  I myself lay\nin the hospital bed, my newly born daughter was  _  in my\narms. I cried and smiled and prayed. Please help me to  _  her\ninto a wonderful girl. And looking down  _  her eyes, I could\nsee the message they held, \"Your  _  would be proud.\"\n    I stand in the kitchen now, and these thoughts flashed through my mind. I glance at my young daughter. A   _  feeling\nrushes through my soul as I take in the familiar  _   .\nI am my mother's shadow.",
