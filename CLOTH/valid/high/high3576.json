    "article": "Who is a great person? To answer this question, we often think of someone  _  , such as the South Africa hero Nelson Mandela or the NBA basketball star Kobe Bryant. But often a great person is  _  next to us--but we never see the greatness unless a difficult  _  comes up.\nIn May, 2008, a high school girl in Beichuan, Sichuan,  _  a hero just next to her. When the earthquake hit, her school  _  on top of the students. Just next to her was her classmate Li Anqiang. Li worked to move rocks to make  _  for her. Before rescuers reached them,  _  , aftershocks brought down  _  rubble  around them. Li's earlier efforts kept his classmate  _  from danger, but the new rubble that fell on his legs crushed   them beyond  _  .\nToday, Li is in a wheelchair; he is missing both of his legs, but he is not missing the good  _  that made him a hero during the earthquake. He still  _  the sports he played before the earthquake, table tennis and basketball--and still  looks up to  his hero, Kobe Bryant.\nKobe Bryant, however, considers Li a hero. In reply to Li's  _  letter, Kobe praised Li as \"a strong boy whose attitude toward  _  was amazing\". He encouraged Li in his love of basketball, telling Li that he looked cool in a photo of his  _  a basketball from his wheelchair.\nSo  _  that we have great people next to us every day--in school, at work, on the bus. There may not be a  _  to show us who they are, but we can be sure they are  _  . Who knows?  _  you are one yourself.",
