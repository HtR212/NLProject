    "article": "Six months ago I made a rash   promise. The leader of the youth   _   in our village rang me in March saying, \"We are thinking of running a children's play program for a   _   in October half-term. Would you be prepared to   _  ?\" My response was, \"sure, why not?\"   In truth   I was a little flattered  to be asked, even though working as a care assistant with old people hardly   _   me for the role. Still, I put the date in my diary. Time flew and   _   I knew it, the day finally came.\nI arrived at the youth centre that morning feeling full of   _  . There were 12 helpers including me and each pair had been allocated   a particular   _   group. Mine was the 10 to 11 year olds.\nAll too quickly the children began   _  . A handful of them were already members of the club but the other forty-five were from the local primary schools.   _   I asked myself why I had decided to spend a day with all these \"little monsters\"   _   when I had two of my own! I needn't have   _   of course as it turned out to be a   _   day. We learned \"action\" songs, decorated biscuits and played memory games. I say \"we\" because I rediscovered my inner   _   and joined in all the activities.\nThe most   _   was the final performance of \"He's got the whole world in his hands\" in the   _   part of the day. The children knew the words and actions off by heart and sang so   _   that it was almost enough to bring the roof down. It made you   _   to witness something so magical.\nThere was one   _   for the children and that was that the play program was only running for a day, and not the whole week. As they said goodbye to me, one of the children   _   and said \"Can we do it again in the next holiday, Miss?\" My response was, \"Sure, why not?\"",
