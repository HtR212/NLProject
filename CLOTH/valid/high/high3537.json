    "article": "At the time my son was born in 1956, I shared a hospital room with a young woman who bore a boy on the same day. Partly because my parents   _  a shop\nselling flowers, the room was soon  _  with the lovely scent\nof roses.\n   As the seventh floral arrangement was  brought in  , I was\nbeginning to feel  _  , for no flowers had arrived for my\nroommate, Ann. She sat on the edge of her bed and leaned forward to admire the  _  bouquet. She was a pretty young woman, yet there was something about\nher large, brown eyes that made me think she had known too much  _  , too much sadness for one so young. I had the feeling she had always\nhad to admire someone else'  _  .\n  \"I'm enjoying every   _  of this\", she said as though she had read\nmy  _  and was trying to reassure me. \"Wasn't I\nthe lucky one to get you for a  _  ?\"\n   I still felt uncomfortable, however.  If only  there\nwere some magic button I could push to  take away  the sadness\nin her eyes. Well, I thought, at least,I can see that she has some flowers.\nWhen my mother and father came to see me that day, I asked them to send  _  some.\n  The flowers arrived just   _  Ann and I were finishing\nsupper.\n  \"More flowers for you,\" she said,   _  .\n  \"No, not this time,\" I said, looking at the   _  \"These are for you.\"\n  Ann stared at the blossoms a long time, not saying anything. She ran her  _  across the pale blue bouquets and  _  touched\neach of the sweet roses as though trying to engrave  them on her    _   .\n  \"How can I ever thank you\" she said softly.\nI was almost embarrassed. It was such a little   _  on my\npart.",
