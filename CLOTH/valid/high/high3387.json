All of the other frogs gathered around to look  _  at their two fallen friends. They all began to  _  shake their heads and croak out warnings. \"It's too deep!\"said one frog. Another said that there was no  _  they would ever be able to get out  _  . The two fallen frogs began to continuously jump as they  _  to get out, but the frogs that were  _  kept croaking louder at them that they might as well stop  _  they were as good as dead and just  _  their time.

The other frog just kept on jumping harder than ever  in spite of  all the loud croaks of disapproval from the frogs around the top of the hole. They kept croaking at him to  _  jumping and save himself from all the  _  and suffering as he jumped and fell back down to the bottom  over and over  . Finally, to the  _  of all the other frogs, he jumped right out of the deep hole. The other frogs asked him, \"Why did you keep jumping  even though  we yelled and croaked at you to stop?\" The frog explained to them he was  _  at that time and that he had thought they were cheering for him and yelling words of  _  to him the entire time! A little encouragement can go a long way. We don't often think about the  _  that our words have upon others. Our words do have the power to hurt or to  _  .",
