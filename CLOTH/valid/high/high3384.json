Have you read the book \"The Wolf Totem'' <<>> by a famous writer Jiang Rong, which tells the story of the relationship between wolves and human beings? Have you ever  thought about  the wolves' world? If you had, you would  _  the wolves. In the book, wolves are heroes on the large grassland. They know more about  _  than humans. They can attack sheep without disturbing their mothers. They also know how to  _  full use of the shape of land to  _  sheep. I believe that if wolves were humans, they would be  _  at fighting. The wolf is a kind of special creature that can deeply understand  _  . Each wolf serves its group with its heart and soul. A  _  wolf has little power, but a group of wolves  _  nothing. All the wolves obey the rules.  Even if  they are beaten, they run away together. It is their teamwork  _  makes wolves powerful. The wolves also have great self-preservation and won't  give in  to anyone. The writer, who wrote the book \"The Wolf Totem\",  _  stole a one - month - old baby wolf and raised it very carefully. To his  _  , he found the little wolf still wanted to go back with  the other  wolves. The little wolf bit through the iron chain that limited it. The wolf was  _  and never gave up fighting  _  its death. It seemed that the little wolf died as a glorious fighter.

They show us how to survive and  succeed in  this not simple but dangerous world. Please honor the wolves, please honor all these heroes of nature!",
