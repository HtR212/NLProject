    "article": "This year I decided to do something to regain my good name as a kindly uncle. My  _  Tony,had never forgiven me for the dictionary I had bought him as a birthday present last year. His  _  had no reason to be thankful to me either,because the year before, I had  _  their dear son with a pot of paste and some funny pictures. Instead of  _  them into a book, Tony had naturally covered every wall in the house with them. This year,  _  , I decided to let him  _  for himself. We went into a big shop,but Tony was very particular about  _  . Although I tried to show him toy after toy,he was not to be  _  . Then I saw he suddenly became  _  ; he had discovered something he really liked: a large tin dram. I was quite happy too  _  I thought what Tony's mother would say when she saw it. Nobody would get any  _  for weeks! I led Tony away  _  , saying that the dram was too expensive. Tony asked for permission to go off  on his own  and I made the most of my chance to sit down end  _  my aching feet. Fifteen minutes passed but there was still no sign of Tony. I began to get  _  and got up to look for him. I asked a young lady if she had seen a little boy in a grey suit. She looked  _  her helplessly and pointed out that there were so many  small boys  in grey suits. I was just going to call the police for help,when I saw a strange  _  dressed in strange orange clothes. He was wearing a false beard and had a caveman's axe in one hand,and a space gun in the other. It was, of course,Tony, who informed me  at once  that he was the first  _  to fly into space.",
