    "article": "After twenty years of working fulltime, I found myself an opportunity to quit my job and be a stay-at-home mom. As I faced this   _  , I thought I would like to be more of a mother than a working woman. My seven-year-old daughter and four-year-old son had grown up in the daycare center   _   they were both six weeks old. At that time, I never felt any regret in handing my   _   over to the center each morning. I had a great job that I   _  and had worked my way   _   to being the Assistant to the Vice-President of Sales at an Internet company. \nI decided to   give up  the job and begin my new one as a fulltime mom, but I felt it strange to lose the47 _ part of my identity. The first time I needed to fill out a(n)   _  for online banking, I came to the line that asked what my   _  was. Eventually, I threw the application away,   rather than   introduce myself as a \"non-worker\". I continued to   _  with this feeling. \n  _  , after a few months of waiting at the bus stop, volunteering in the classroom, and making good dinners, I   got used to  being a fulltime mom. My daughter was in school, but my son Cobi was   _   me all day. For the first time in his life, I was   _   his. We took walks, played soccer and made crafts. He enjoyed my   _   all the time and I began to see what I had once   _  . \nOne day as we kicked the ball in the park, Cobi   looked up at   me and said, \"Mommy, do you know what I want to be when I grow up?\" \n\"A professional   _  ?\" I asked. \n\"No,\" he smiled at me. \"I want to be a stay-at-home mom.\" \nMy heart melted. I've never   _   my decision since then.",
