    "article": "Each of us struggles for self-respect and self-worth to some degree. I spent much time trying to achieve perfection in every aspect of my life. I was a happy kid with a lot of friends and a supportive family. But growing up was really  _  and even scary sometimes. During my childhood, I was constantly involved in something that included people's viewing my achievements or my  _  . I wanted everyone's praise and acceptance, but I was my own toughest critic.\nAfter I graduated from high school, my  _  to be \"thin\" began to trouble me. I began trying to diet by  _  my food. In the beginning, I felt great--attractive and successful, almost superhuman. I even thought that I was better than everyone else. What I didn't see was that I was slowly  _  myself. People around me began to  _  my weight loss. They said with concern, \"You're losing too much weight.\" \"Elisa, you're so thin.\" All their words only suggested that I was getting closer to \"  _  \". Sadly, I took my physical  _  the first important in my life,  _  that it was the way to become successful and accepted. Then I cut down my  _   more and more, until a  _  day consisted of half a teaspoon of nonfat yoghurt and coffee in the morning and a cup of grapes at night.\nBut my poor  _  began to cause me to lose  _  . Then one night, like many nights before, I couldn't sleep and my heart felt as though it might beat out of my chest. I tried to  _  , but I couldn't. The beating became so rapid and so strong that I could no longer  _  . What I had done to diet nearly caused me to have a heart attack. I stood up, and immediately fell down. I was really  _  , and I knew I needed help. My roommate rushed me to the  _   , beginning the long road to my  _  . It took a lot--doctors, nurses, nutritionists, food supplements...And most important, a sense of what was true about myself got back on track with reality. I realized that, with my  _  of trying to be \"perfect\"on the  _  , I had sacrificed who I was on the inside. What I know now is, we are--each and every one of us--already perfect.",
