This saying encourages people to42 _ more by hanging out with those who are more driven and43 _  than they are.\nI heard this saying44 _ to me from my daughter's friend this past week. Ally, Wes and I have been running for upcoming45 _ . I'm going to do another 5K and Ally and Wes are going to do the 12-mile obstacle course.46 _ , their training is more intense than mine, but when I was in47 _ with them last week, Wes suddenly said,\"You should48 _ with us!\"\n\"You mean do what you're doing?\"I asked, with a surprised49 _ on my face.\n\"Exactly,\"he answered.\"You can do it! You50 _ need someone to push you.\"\nAs much as I51 _ to admit it, he was right. I needed to52 _ outside my comfort zone. I always let them run ahead of me, content to run at my own comfortable pace. But that was the53 _ -- I'd grown too comfortable with my training.\nI hadn't been pushing myself. Ever since I had the surgery in April, I was a little54 _ about running again.

I was able to run -- only about 5 minutes at a time before I had to walk again -- but it was a(n)56 _ .

Are you being58 _ in every area of your life, or are you very comfortable these days, not being59 _ at all, still living inside your comfort zone? If you're the most60 _ one, then it's time to get into a new circle or at least add to your existing ones.",
