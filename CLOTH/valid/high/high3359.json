My mom asked where she kept her things. She pointed to an old car. She said there were six of them  _  in that car, which was the same size as my  _  .\nAfter  _  her a few dollars, we said goodbye. Then, my mother sent me inside the restaurant with my dad and my  _  . But she didn't come.  _  , she had gone home and  _  our cupboards into a few bags. She brought all the  _  over to the car and handed the bags to the family. I wasn't there when that  _  , but I could imagine the  _  appearing on their faces.\nLater, when I  found out  about what she had done, I asked her  _  she helped them. She told me that the girl's family  _  needed help. The girl and I were the same  _  , yet we lived  _  lives.\nHere I stood,  _  in good clothes, headed to dine in a restaurant and then back home to the bedroom I  _  with my sisters. I remembered thinking that the other girl didn't have any food to eat and had to share a cold car with five other people. After  _  this picture in my mind, I understood why my mom had done what she had done. She  _  me one of the best lessons I ever learned.",
