Yet parents often  _  to give their children what they had when they were young. For example, today's generations of children mostly have their own private  _  with a television, their own cell phone, their own computer, and finally when they are  _  enough they will even have their own cars.  As a result of  all of these things, children do not  _  these gifts as much as previous generations did.  _  , children are often  more than  just spoiled , and all these things give them  _  enjoyment when they really need some  _  to their own development. Finally, children  _  these short-term activities in order to fight against their boredom, and as a result of this, kids  _  shorter periods of attention with little  _  . The obvious question that you may be asking is probably that:  _  patience is a virtue, then why don't parents  _  it? In today's society, it is far easier to make children lose concentration than to teach personal development  _  and that's a common problem. For example, it is much easier for parents to buy a new toy or turn on the television for their children than to  _  their curiosity in a natural way. This strong  _  to know the world will lead them through self-learning, by which they would slowly value the  _  of hard work and patience. Basically, the easiest method for parents to teach patience to their children is not by  _  them things, but by giving their children an opportunity to learn what they are interested in. Thus, parents can teach their children the same  _  lessons that they have painfully learned too. The point is, realize what they lack and take action immediately.",
