One evening, after hunting in the forest all  day  , I was returning alone to the place where I had  _  up my tent. I was tired  _  hungry. It was getting  _  and darker, and I was walking slowly  _  a narrow path. On my right was a wide river; on my left, a  _  , dark forest. All of a  _  I saw two green eyes looking at me from among the trees. I knew it  _  be a man-eating tiger. The tiger was getting ready to  _  on me. My heart  _  . What could I do? Should I jump  _  the river and hope to save my life  _  swimming? I looked to the  _  . In the river there was a  _  crocodile waiting to welcome me with its mouth  _  open. I was so  _  that I shut my eyes. And I thought it would be the end of my  _  . I heard branches moving  _  the tiger roared and jumped.  _  then I opened my eyes. What do you think had happened? The tiger had jumped right over me and now in the jaws of the crocodile.",
