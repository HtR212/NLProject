    "article": "Shyness can make people feel awkward, worried or tense on social occasions. Shyness is the cause of much   _   for a great many people. Shy people often feel   _   and are self-conscious; that is, they are over concerned with their own   _   and actions. For example, they often ask themselves \"Am I wearing unattractive clothes?\" \nObviously, it is such a(n)   _   feeling that people must be affected unfavorably. A person's self concept is reflected in the way he or she   _   and affects other people's attitudes towards him or her. In general, the way people think about themselves has a deep influence on all areas of their lives. Shy people, with low self-esteem ,are likely to be passive and easily   _   by others. They need reassurance that they are doing \"the   _   thing\". Shy people are very   _   to criticism. It makes them feel inferior .They also find it difficult to be   _   by pleasing words because they believe they are unworthy of it .A shy person may respond to a(n)   _   with a statement like this one:\" You're just saying that to make me feel good .I know it's not true.\"\nIt is clear that, while self-awareness is a (n)   _   quality, overdoing it is harmful. Can shyness be   _   got rid of, or at least reduced? Fortunately, people can make it with determination. It is important for people to accept their weaknesses as well as their   _      and remember that it is   _   for them to label themselves inferior because each individual is   _   and has his or her own characteristics.",
