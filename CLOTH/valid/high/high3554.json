He was filled with understanding and love. He was lifted to a 26 _ he had never known or 27 _ . He wanted to play music that showed the power of 28 _ and stars just for the old man. And 29 _ the storm and winds to join him, he stood and played the Kreutzer Sonata  of Beethoven.\nThe moments 30 _ . Moments that were days in the birth of fire and stars, moments of the 31 _ of all men, and finally moments that showed the 32 _ of all human spirit. Never 33 _ had Rudolph played with such power. 34 _ , waves and winds beat the lighthouse with giant hands. Above, the strong light 35 _ its life-saving beams across the dark and angry seas.
