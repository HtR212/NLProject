    "article": "When I walked along the Oxford Road, I felt as though the world was closing to me. All the   _   I take for granted had gone. I had entered into a world of silence.\nThis   _   experience occurred a few weeks ago when I agreed to \"go deaf for the day to   _   the work of the charity Hearing Dogs for Deaf People. Now I serve as an ambassador.\nThat day when I 44 called for a cab  to take me to the office of my manager, Gavin, I couldn't hear what the taxi driver was saying to me.  _  was impossible. Then, when I reached the office, I had to   _   the interphone  five times as I couldn't hear a(n)   _  .\nEverybody said I was shouting at them -- I simply wasn't   _   of the volume of my own voice. Gavin kept telling me my phone was ringing, but I didn't   _  . I was too busy trying to concentrate on   _   his lips. And when he tried to tell me a code to put into my phone, I had to keep asking him to repeat it more slowly again and again.   _   he lost his patience and shouted at me: \"Just give me the phone!\" I was shocked.\nPeople couldn't be   _   to repeat themselves, so they kept trying to do things for me that I was   _   to finish by myself. I lost control, feeling   _   and awkward.\nBeing deaf for the day was extraordinarily   _  . I had to work so hard to \"56 _ \" with my eyes, get people's attention and use my other   _   to make up for my lack of hearing. It was a huge, exhausting effort. Until that   _   I didn't realize how much I took my own hearing for granted, or the sorts of emotions and experiences deaf people go   _  .\nTherefore, if a deaf person asks you to repeat something,  _   say: \"It doesn't matter. \" It does matter.",
