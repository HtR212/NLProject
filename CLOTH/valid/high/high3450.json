Ever since Skylar  _  of Disneyland from TV, she  _  her nickels and dimes in a piggy bank in  _  of visiting there someday. Her parents  _  her with a trip when she was four, however, and didn't even  _  her to use her own money! When Skylar returned. It was  Christmastime  . She decided to buy presents with her  _  . But she also learned from announcements on TV about a local  _  shelter called \"The Road House\". She  _  asked her mother what \"homeless\" meant and why those children  _  coats and warm clothes. She couldn't seem to get the homeless off her mind. Her mother took her to the store to buy  _  . Instead of buying for herself or her family, however, she  _  to purchase a warm coat, socks and gloves for a little girl in the  _  .She also wanted to buy a doll, but when she  _  she didn't have enough money, she left the doll  _  . When Skylar got home, she chose one of her  _  dolls and put it into the box with the other items she bought that day. She could hardly wait for Christmas! Skylar was thinking about going to the shelter and giving her carefully  _  gifts to a homeless child. She was much filled with joy at  _  helping someone else. \"Perhaps it's good to have a beautiful mind,  _  an even greater gift is to have a beautiful heart,\" says Nobel Laureate John Hash. Young Skylar has a beautiful heart. It is one  _  , above all else, which makes beautiful people.",
