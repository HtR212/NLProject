    "article": "Many students often say that they don't have \" enough time\" to do all their schoolwork.\nMy  _  is often brief, \"You have as much time as the president.\" I usually carry on a bit about there being twenty-four hours in the day for  _  , and suggest that \"not enough time\" is not an  _  explanation of not getting something  _  .\n  _  in graduate school, I tried to prove to one of my professors  _  saying that I was working hard. His answer to me was, \"That's irrelevant.  _  is important is the  _  of your work. \" Since then I have had time to think carefully about the  _  of \" hard worker\" ,and I have come to some  _  -- all  relevant to the problem of how much time we have.\nIf you analyze the matter, you can identify two parts of the problem: There is,  of course  , the matter of \" time\" , which we can think of as  _  . Then there is the problem of \"work\" during that time. But, as my professor suggested, it's not how hard one works  _  the quality of the product that's important.\nThat led me to a new idea: the quality of the work. That  _  is perhaps best explained by a sign I once saw on the wall in someone's office: \"Don't work harder. Work smarter. \"There are a lot of  _  in that idea.\nIf you can't get more time, and few of us can, the only solution is to improve the quality of the work. That means thinking of  _  to get more out of the same time than we might otherwise get. That should lead us to an analysis of our working habits. Since \"work\" for students usually means \"homework\", the expression \"working\" habits should be read as \"  _  habits\".\nThen, as a smart student, you will  _  to improve those skills that you use in study,  _  reading and writing. If you learn to read better and write better, there are big benefits that  pay off  in all your studies.",
