    "article": "Is talking on a cell phone hazardous  to your health? It is difficult to know for sure. Some research suggests that   _  users of mobile phones are at a greater risk of developing braintumours .   _  , many other studies suggest there are no links\nbetween cancer and cell phone use.\nThe main problem with the current research is that mobile phones have only been   _  since\nthe 1990s.   As a result  , it is impossible to study the\nlong term exposure of cell phone use. This  _  many\nhealth professionals who point out that many cancers take at least 10 years to\ndevelop. Another concern about these studies is that many have been funded by\nthose who  _  financially from the cell phone industry.\nSome researchers believe that other types of wireless technology may also be   _  to\nhuman health, including laptops andcordless  phones. Organizations that are concerned about the effects of Electromagnetic Radiation suggest   _  all cordless devices with\nwired ones. They say that many cordless phones  give off  dangerous\nlevels of EMR even when they are not in use. They even suggest  _  electronic devices, such as computers and alarm clocks out of\nbedrooms, or at least six feet from your pillow.\nA growing number of health professionals worldwide are recommending that cell phone users err on the side of caution until more definitive studies can be conducted. They recommend that   _  use headsets or speaker phones and that\nchildren and teens, whose brain tissues are still developing, use cell phones\nonly for  _  .Concerned medical experts use the\nexample of tobacco to  _  the potential risks.\nMany years ago, people smoked freely and were not concerned about the effects\nof cigarettes on their health. Today, people know that cigarettes cause lung\ncancer, though it is still unknown  _  how or\nwhy. Some doctors   _  that the same thing\nwill happen with devices such as cell phones.",
