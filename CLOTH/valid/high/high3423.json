But, she brought such joy and love into our lives that we still miss her.\nThere are so many wonderful stories about the   _  in\nthis dog, but my  _  is this one:\nIt was an autumn day in Minnesota. But, the  _  didn't\nseem to know the difference between fall and winter.  _  ,\nwe were  _  with a big snow fall  _  which\nno one was prepared.\nWe have two apple trees in our backyard. Prana loved apples. When she went outside, she'd take hold of an apple, stick it far back in her  _  ,\nand sneak it into the house to  _  for eating later.\nThe apples had been on the ground and were often muddy so I wasn't always  _  that Prana had brought them into the house.  _  my disapproval, she would turn her head so I wouldn't see her hidden  _  .It was our little  _  .\nOn the day that it snowed too early in the season, Prana went outside and I   _  her from the window. I  _  that she was\nmadly digging holes and  _  the apples to the\nsurface so they could be seen  _  the snow.\nI wondered why she was doing this. She seemed to be completely  _  with some kind of important task to dig up as many apples as possible\nduring her yard time.\nWhen I called her back into the house, she had her   _  one\napple in her mouth. About five minutes later, I looked outside. The yard was\ncompletely covered with  _  . Prana had dug up\nall those apples for her bird and squirrel friends to eat. She knew that they wouldn't\nhave stored enough food to  _  such an early\nwinter!",
