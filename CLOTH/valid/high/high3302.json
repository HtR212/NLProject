After winning a big game,athletes are often asked how they feel.Usually athletes say how  _  it is to win this big game.On the contrary,the fact is that losing a big game,or in my case,all the games,can be even harder. From the spectators' point of view,last year's basketball  _  for my high school team was nothing  _  of an embarrassment.And  while  0--20 is certainly nothing to be proud of,that season had a bigger impact on me than any other.As a team captain,I knew it probably wouldn't be the  easiest  year,but did I ever think we would lose every game?Of course not.Since six of our top players had graduated,it was clear that we were a (n)  _  team who would struggle.The struggle began earlier than expected,  _  ,as our team center was suspended for the season,and two key members decided to  _  for some reason.At this point,dropping out probably passed through every player's mind,but in the end,we all stuck it out,  _  to work still harder.
