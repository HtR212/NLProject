After being introduced to the class, I bravely put on a smile and took my seat.\nLunchtime was a pleasant surprise when the girls all crowded around my table. They were friendly, so I began to   _   . My new classmates told me about the school, the teachers and the other kids. They   _   out the class nerd   to me: Mary Lou. She was a pretty girl with dark eyes and olive-skin,    _   she wore a long woolen skirt and an old-fashioned blouse. She looked stupid. The girls whispered and giggled    _   Mary Lou walked by. She ate alone.\nAfter school, the girls invited me to   _   them in front of the school. I was thrilled to be  a(n)     _   of the club. We waited. For what, I didn't know. Then Mary Lou came down the school steps. The girls started making fun of her, shouting rudely, biting comments. I    _   , then joined right in. Mean remarks fell from my   _  . No one could    _    I'd never done this before. The other girls stepped back and started cheering for me. Feeling    _  , I pulled on her backpack and then pushed her. Her backpack broke, Mary Lou fell and I backed off. Everyone was laughing. I 47 _   in. I was a leader.\nI was not proud. Something inside me   _   . If you've ever picked a wing off a butterfly, you know how I felt.\nMary Lou got up,    _   her books and left without a tear or saying anything. She held her head     _   as blood ran down from her knee. I   _    her limp away down the street.\nI turned to leave with my   _    friends and noticed a man standing beside his car. He must have been Mary Lou's father --- he had the same olive skin, dark hair and handsome look. He remained still and watched the   _   girl walk toward him. Only his eyes --- shining with both sadness and pride --- followed. As I passed, he looked at me in silence with burning tears that reminded me of my    _   . \n              Mary Lou's father's eyes taught me a good lesson that day. I never again hurt someone for my own   _   .",
