Recently I overheard a father and daughter in their last moments together at the airport. The airline had announced her  _  and standing near the security gate, they hugged and he said, \"I love you. I wish you enough.\" She  in turn  said, \"Dad, our life together has been more than enough. Your love is all I ever needed. I wish you enough, too, Dad.\" They kissed and she left. He walked over toward the window where I was seated. Standing there I could see he wanted and needed to  cry  . I tried not to interrupt him, but he  _  me in by asking, \"Did you ever say good-bye to someone knowing it would be forever?\" \"Yes, I have,\" I replied. \"Forgive me for asking, but why is this a forever good-bye?\" \"I am  _  and she lives much too far away. I have  _  ahead, and the reality is, the next trip back will be for my funeral\" he said. \"When you were saying good-bye I heard you say, 'I wish you enough'. May I ask what that means?\" He began to smile. \"That's a wish that has been  handed down  for many generations within my family. My parents  used to  say it to everyone.\" He paused for a moment, looking up as if trying to remember it  in detail  , and then he smiled and  _  the following: \"I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright. I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more. I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive. I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life appear much  _  . I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting. I wish you enough  _  to appreciate all that you possess. I wish you enough 'Hellos' to get you enough the final 'Good-byes'.\" Then he walked away, leaving me lost in thought.",
