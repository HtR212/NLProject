She has run 52marathons---once a week---for the past year in memory of her dad who   passed away   just 35 days after he was   _   with pancreatic cancer . When Julie Weiss lost her father in 2010, she was   _   to find the research for pancreatic cancer is so short of fund. \" It made me feel   _  .\" she said, \"I knew I had to do something.\"\nSo this marathon queen,   _   she calls herself, did what she did best; she went running. Having completed 25 marathons during the   _  two years, Julie now vowed  to run 52 marathons in 52 weeks in   _  of her father. After asking people to   _   money for each marathon, she   set up  a website, marathon goddess, com, to collect money for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network(PANCAN), a nonprofit organization. Julie began her incredible   _  with a marathon is Rome and then entered a race every   _  in some city across North America.   _  leaving work at 5p.m.on Friday she would be ready to begin the next race, before she  _  home to California on Sunday. Julie finished her 1,362.4-mile journey in March 2013,   _   more than $ 200,000 in the process for PANCAN.\nWhile running, she stuck to a strict training schedule. \"My body's getting used to this. I'm changing my diet, becoming more healthy and learning to run more   _  .\" she said. When her muscles began to   _  , she kept her   _   in mind. \"When you do what you love, for those you love, that is where the    _   happen. Together we can make a(n)  _  ,and pave the way for a happy, healthy, cancer free life.\" she said.",
