    "article": "Even after many years, she still has not forgotten the last day her whole class got together to say goodbye to their dearest schooldays. Those  _  memories always become vivid every time nostalgia drives her feet towards the old  _  , only to find a big old tree with all of their names carved deep into the  _  and the new school houses. Time has changed each fate beyond any  _  .The jolly \"dwarf\" of the class has now turned into a  _  businessman. The shy, skinny \"bookworm\" is now a talented Ph. D. That naughty girl has  _  the well-known athlete and the class beauty a movie star. But she, a  _  addict, was driven by an inner force to put her pen aside and becomes a  _  instead. Now, she is a teacher, yet she has to  _  learning numerous difficult lessons of life. The more she  _  , the better she understands the value of her teacher's  _  lesson. She has given her students the whole-hearted  _  and tenderness that she once received from her teacher who passed  _  years ago. Now and then, she catches  _  of a warm look in the eyes of her students, which encourages her to  carry on  . She hopes to find herself again in her students: always listening carefully and appreciating each  _  . To her, that will be the noblest award she could  _  receive in her teaching years. She tells herself to try her best to understand and take life at its deepest.  _  she hasn't enough teaching experience she will give her students the  _  that are not written in the lesson plans, as her teacher used to do. Her teacher's  _  \"The giving of love is an education in itself\" will be always in her mind.",
