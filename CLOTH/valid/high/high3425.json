Choices can be hard.\" I got the  _  to start Amazon 16 years ago.I  came across  the fact that the Internet usage was growing at 2300 percent per year.I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew so fast,and the idea of building an  _  bookstore with millions of titles was very  _  to me.I had just turned 30,and I'd been married for a year.I told my wife that I wanted to  _  my job and go to do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't  _  since most start-ups don't,and I wasn't sure what to  _  .She told me I should  stick to  the idea.I'd always wanted to be an inventor,and she wanted me to follow my  _  . I was working at a financial firm in New York City with a  _  boss that I admired very much.I went to my boss and  _  with him that I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet.He took me on a long walk in Central Park,listened  _  to me,and finally said,\"That sounds like a really good idea,  _  it would be an even better idea for someone who didn't already have a good job.\"That logic made some  _  to me,and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours  _  making a final decision.Seen in that light,it really was a difficult  _  ,but finally, I decided I had to give it a shot.I didn't think I'd regret  _  and failing.And I suspected I would always be troubled by the decision not to try at a11.After much  _  ,I took the less  _  path to follow my dream,and I'm  _  of that Choice.For all of us,in the end,we are our choices.",
