    "article": "I work in a company in India which has branches in Germany and the UK,so I  _  take business trips to these places.We have a tradition at the company that anybody coming back to India from a foreign country gets  _  for all the other members of the company.Naturally the chocolates are finished in no time because everyone  _  them and tries to get as many as possible. I  _  that the housekeeping staff members never had the chance to get even a single chocolate maybe because they were not as quick as others to take the chocolates.I felt it was  _  to them. Recently, I came back to India from Munich and I had  _  a lot of chocolates for them.I met one of the housekeeping staff members called Babu.I gave him a packet of chocolates and told him to distribute them  _  in his department.His face lit up with joy and thanked me again and again,which made me very happy. But the  _  didn't end here.The best part of it was that Babu actually distributed the chocolates to  _  in the company equally instead of just distributing them among members in his  _  .So it was so touching for me to see this. I find it really hard to  _  why we,who have the money to buy chocolates and other goodies,do not feel like  _  but just think about how to get more.  _  ,Babu,who earns only just about enough to raise his family, was so generous and did not even  _  one extra chocolate for himself.I want to request all of us learn from Babu for being so  _  and caring!",
