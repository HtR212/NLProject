One day Chunk is on a  _  across the Pacific Ocean when suddenly his plane crashes. Chunk survives the crash and  lands on  a deserted island. On the island, Chunk has to learn to survive all  _  . He has to learn how to collect water, hunt for food, and make fire. Perhaps the most difficult challenge is  _  to survive without friends.  In order to  survive, Chunk develop a friendship with  an unusual  friend----a volleyball he calls Wilson. Chunk learns a lot about himself when he is alone on the island. He realizes that he hasn't been a very good friend  _  he has always been thinking about himself. During his five years on the island, Chunk learns how to be a good friend to Wilson  _  Wilson is just a volleyball. Chunk learns that we need friends to  _  happiness and sorrow, and that it is important to have someone to care about. He also learns that he  should have care  more about his friends. When he makes friends with Wilson, he understands that friendship is abou  _  and that we must give as much as we take. The lesson we can  learn from  Chunk and all the others who have unusual friends is that friends are teachers. Friendship helps us understand who we are, why we need each other and  _  we can do for each other.",
