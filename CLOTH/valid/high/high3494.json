    "article": "Ever since sixth grade, I have gotten along with pretty much everyone at our middlesize school. It's no  _  that those who were thought to be popular  _  me. One friend in partciular, a tall blonde by name of Christina, was, in  _  , one of my cloest friends. We would hang out a lot,   _  in the summer. She isn't one of those friends that you can  _  all your feeling to. Actually our only concern was being active, and  _  fun, not worrying about boys and things like that.\nWhen we got to high school, things  _  . The popular crowd was no longer a distinct group. They were,   _  , the daring, \"sexy\"individuals that everyone still wanted to be liked. They would  _  together every weekend, making out with guys and girls years older than they were. Spring break would be  _  with friends, not family, and their friends would always have the best cars and equipment. It figures that I would  _  Christina to be like this as well. I found out how  _  I was one Saturday night.\nI, Christina and  another  \"popular\"freind were hanging out talking. \"Should we tell her our  _  ?\" they questioned. I urged them to tell me, baffled that they would have a secret that no one  _  in the school would know about. \"We've never made out with a guy. Actually, to be honest, we've  _  really had a first kiss, well, at  _  one that I would want to count be a first kiss.\"I was  _  ! These are two of the most pretty, popular girls in school!\nI guess the moral of the story is that everyone  _  the\"popular\"to have that sort of image, but it's not all  _  . See them in a different light, and they could turn out to be the best friends you've ever had.",
