    "article": "My family came to America in 1985.  _  of us spoke a word of English. Each morning I disliked going to school for fear of not  _  what people were saying. Very soon my mother noticed something was  _  me. The pain and care I saw in her moonshaped eyes made me burst into tears. I explained to her the  _  I had of going to school. \"Learning English is not  _  ,\" my mother said. She cheerfully  _  the two of us work together to learn the language at home. The  _  and determination my mother had were admirable because English was as  _  to her as it was to me. That afternoon,I saw my mother in a different light as she  waited for  me by the school fence. She was the shortest of all the mothers there,  _  , her face with her welcoming smile and big,black eyes was the most  _  . The afternoon sun shone  _  on her long,black hair creating an atmosphere that made her different from others. My mother and I immediately began reading together and  _  five new words a day. My mother,with her encouraging attitude,made the routine fun and interesting. The fact that she was sacrificing her  _  time before going to work so that I could learn English made me see the  _  she owned. Very soon I began to understand what everyone was saying.",
