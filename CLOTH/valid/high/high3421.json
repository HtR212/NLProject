    "article": "I was sitting at the bar of a local restaurant having  lunch 0  and taking a break. A pretty girl who looked about 25 walked in and sat down in a booth  _  for her friend. It didn't take long  _  I saw she was trying to stay  _  from other people's gazes and my heart sank. You could see her hair was  falling out  and, at such a young age, she was receiving chemo . I sat there watching her trying to remain composed and she was having a  _  time of it. I  _  for her, imagining what it must be like to go through this and yet I know some of her  _  . You see I  _  my wife, the love of my life just a few short years ago and watched her slowly fade away. I needed to give a message of  _  to this girl. But how? What could I do? Then it  _  to me! I called over her waitress and explained that I wanted to buy the girl and her friend's lunch but I also told her not to tell her it was me. I also  _  the waitress a note to give to the girl. The note  _  as follows: \" Someone today thought you were beautiful; someone today thought your smile glowed  _  excitement; someone today thought your eyes  _  up the world; someone today cared and wanted you to know this. Enjoy the rest of your day, pretty young lady.\" About 15 minutes later, the young girl asked for her  _  and I watched as she was told it was paid for. She asked why? Who? What for? The waitress simply handed her the note and  _  to her the gentleman who did it left. I watched as she slowly read the note. Her eyes tore up, for only a moment, and then came the smile! A huge, beautiful, hopeful smile! She lit up the room and then sat up straight, not  _  who saw her. It's not  _  we look or what we have; it's not our houses or how many cars we have; nor is it how much money we can earn. It's all about how much we care and what we do,  even though  it's making someone feel pretty only for a moment.",
