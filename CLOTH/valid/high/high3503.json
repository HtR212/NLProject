    "article": "My husband, Tom, has always been good with animals, but I was still amazed when he befriended a female grouse . It's  _  for a grouse to have any contact with people. In fact, they're hard to spot,  _  they usually fly off when they hear humans approaching. This grouse came into our lives in  _  Tom was working out in the field when he  _  her walking around at the edge of the field. She was  _  unafraid and seemed to be  _  about what he was doing. Tom saw the  _  bird several times, and she got more comfortable around him. We quickly grew  _  of the bird and decided to call her Mildred. One day, as Tom was working, Mildred came within a few feet of him to watch. Tom  _  he didn't see her and kept working to see what she would do next. Apparently, she didn't like to be  _  . She'd run up and peck at Tom's hands, then  _  off to see what he would do. This went on for about 20 minutes, until Mildred became tired of the  _  and left. As spring went and summer came, Mildred started to  come out  more and more often.  _  Mildred felt comfortable enough to jump up on Tom's leg and stay long enough for me to get a  _  of the two of them together. This friendly grouse soon felt  _  not just with our family, but with anybody who walked or drove by. When hunting season opened, we put a  _  at the end of our driveway asking  _  not to shoot our pet grouse. My father, who lived down the road,  _  warned people not to shoot her.  In fact  . hunters would stop and take pictures, because they had never seen anything like her.",
