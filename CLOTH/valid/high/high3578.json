She had  _  a picture of Tippity's garden with flowers and a boy  made fun of  of it.\n\"But it is good,\" said Margaret's Mother.\" Let's  _  it to Tippity and see what she thinks.\"\nTippity looked at the picture and  _  ,\"What a lovely drawing! You are a fine  _  .\"Margaret felt a little better. \"It's a picture of your garden,\" she said. \"But a boy at a school said it was  _  .\"\n\"Nonsense!\" said Tippitiy. \"We all  _  things in different ways and we all find our own  _  to show people what we see. Everybody is  _  and art is for everybody.\" \"Let's go to see Uncle Dot and I'll show you what I mean.\"\nUncle Dot was  _  a picture of two fishermen who were working on their boat.\n\"Well, this is  _  !\"Uncle Dot studied the drawing and said,\"I like the way you showed all the  _  in Trippity's garden, and that's a very cheerful sun in the sky. Art is such great  _  ,isn't it?\"\nEveryone agreed that it was good fun.\n\"Why don't all of us sit down and  _  with me for a while? I have lots of art supplies. Use  _  you like.\"\nWhen they were  _  ,they hung their picture up and stepped back to look at them. Each piece was different. Everyone had seen the  _  things: a boat, two freshmen, the sea, the sky and the sun,  _  person drew those things in his or her own way.\n\"See? You are all artists!\" said Uncle Dot.\nFrom that day on, Margaret and her mother  _  rawing and all kinds of art. They didn't  _  whether others thought their work was \"good\" or not, because they knew that didn't matter at all.",
