There is no  _  for stillness. And when we are  _  to be still because we're in line for something, or waiting at a doctor's appointment, or on a bus or train, we often  _  something to do. Some will play with mobile devices, others will read something. Being still isn't something we're  used to  . This comes at a  _  : we lose that time for  _  , for observing and listening. We lose peace. And  _  yet: sometimes too much action is worse than no action at all. You can run around crazily, but get  _  done. Take a moment to think about  _  you spend your days. Are you constantly rushing around? Are you constantly reading and answering  _  , checking on the news and the latest stream of information? Are you always  _  through your schedule? Is this how you want to spend your  _  ? If so, peace be with you. If not, take a moment to be  _  . Don't think about what you have to do, or what you've done already.  _  be in the moment. Then after a minute or two of doing that, consider your life, and how you'd  _  it to be. See your life with less movement, less doing, less rushing. See it with more stillness, more consideration, more  _  . Then be that vision. It's pretty simple: all you have to do is sit still for a little bit each day.  _  you've gotten used to that, try doing less each day. Breathe when you feel yourself moving too  _  . Slow down. Be present. Find happiness now, in this moment, instead of  _  for it.  _  the stillness. It's a treasure, and it's available to us, always.",
