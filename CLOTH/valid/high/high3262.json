    "article": "Friday\nWhat do you think, Daddy? The English instructor said that my last paper   _   an unusual amount of originality. She did, truly. Those were her   _  . It doesn't seem possible, does it,   _   the eighteen years of training that I've had? The   _   of the John Grier Home is to turn the ninety-seven orphans into ninety-seven twins. \nThe unusual artistic ability which I   _   was developed at an early age through drawing chalk pictures of Mrs. Lippett on the door. \nI hope that I don't hurt your feelings when I take a   _   to the home of my youth? But you have the upper hand, you know, for   _   I become too impolite, you can always stop payment of your cheques. That isn't a very polite thing to say--but you can't   _   me to have any manners; a foundling  asylum   isn't a young ladies' finishing school. \nYou know, Daddy, it isn't the work that is going to be 44 _  in college. It's the play. Half the time I don't know   _   the girls are talking about; their jokes seem to relate to a past that everyone   _   me has shared. I'm a foreigner in the world and I don't   _   the language. It's a miserable feeling. I've had it all my life. At the high school the girls   _   stand in groups and just look at me. I was   _   and everybody knew it. I could FEEL 'John Grier Home' written on my face. And then a few kindly ones would make a point of coming up and saying something   _  . I HATED EVERY ONE OF THEM--the kindly ones most of all.\nNobody here knows that I was 51 brought up  in an asylum. I told Sallie McBride that my mother and father were   _  , and that a kind old gentleman was sending me to college which is   _   true, so far as it goes. I don't want you to think I am a coward , but I do want to be like the other girls, and that Dreadful Home is the one great big difference. If I can   _   my back on that and shut out the remembrance, I think, I might be just as   _   as any other girl. I don't believe there's any real, underneath difference, do you?\nAnyway, Sallie McBride likes me! \nYours ever, Judy Abbott (Nee Jerusha. )",
