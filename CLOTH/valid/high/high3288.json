They discussed the  _  they gave their elderly mother who lived far away in another city. The first said, \"I had a  _  house built for Mama.\" The second said, \"I had my Mercedes-Benz dealer send a  _  to her.\" The third said, \"I built a beautiful  _  for Mama.\" The fourth said, \"You know  _  Mama loved reading poems and you know she can't read anymore because she can't  _  very well. I met a  _  who had a parrot that can recite many poems. It took him 12 years to  _  it to speak and he earns his living by renting it out. I had to pay him $100,000 a year for twenty years,  _  it is worth it.\" On hearing that, the other brothers were  _  by his good thought. After the holidays their mother  sent out  her thank-you notes, which read: \"Milton, the house you built is so huge. I only live in one room, but I have to  _  the whole house. It's a tiring job. Thanks anyway.\" \"Marvin, I am too old to  _  . I stay home and have my foods delivered, so I'll  _  use the car. The  _  was good, although not practical. Thanks.\" \"Michael, you gave me an expensive building for 50 people to  _  plays or watch movies in it, but all my friends are dead. I've almost  _  my hearing and I'm nearly blind. I won't use it. Thank you all the same.\" \"Dearest Melvin, you were the  _  son to have the good sense to give a little thought to your gift. The chicken tasted so  _  . I liked it very much. Thank you.\"",
