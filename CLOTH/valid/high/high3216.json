They became friends soon and talked for hours every day.They spoke of their families,their children,their hobbies,and their  _  .Each day John would sit up and  _  to his roommate Bill what he could see outside the window. Through John's description,Bill's world was  _  and brightened by all the activities and colors of the outside world.The window overlooked a beautiful park with a lovely  _  ,John told Bill.Ducks played on the water  _  children sailed their model boats.And a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance.As John described all these  in detail  ,Bill would close his eyes and  _  the picturesque scene.Bill was recovering  1ittle by 1ittle  . However,John became weak day by day. Late one night,Bill was lying in bed  staring at  the ceiling when John began to cough seriously.Then doctors and nurses rushed to the room.Thirty minutes later, John  _  coughing.Now,there was only silence--  _  silence. The following morning,Bill was moved to the bed next to the window at his request.Slowly and  _  ,he supported himself up on one elbow to take the first look.But to his  _  ,he could see nothing but a  _  wall. Only at that moment did he begin to realize that the pursuit of happiness was a matter of  _  .It was a positive attitude we chose to express.It was not a gift that was  _  to our doorstep each morning,nor did it come through the window.It was all inward journey.Whether a man is happy or not depends on his own thoughts  rather than  anything outward. So Bill began to describe the  _  world to his new roommate that he saw through the only window of the room.",
