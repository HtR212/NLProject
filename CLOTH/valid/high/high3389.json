An injured man was  _  in, and the doctor turned to  one  of the students and asked him, \"What's wrong with this man?\" \"I don't know, sir.\" the student answered. \"  _  I examine him and  _  out?\" \"There is no  _  to examine him.\" said the doctor. \"You should know without asking questions. He has  _  his right knee . Don't you notice the  _  he walked? He hurt it by  burning  it in the fire. You see his leg is burnt away at the  _  . It is Monday morning now. Yesterday was  _  , but on Saturday the roads were  _  and muddy . The man's trousers are muddy  all over  . The man fell down on Saturday  night  .\" The doctor then turned to the man and said, \"You  _  your wages on Saturday and went to a  _  house and drank too much. You  _  wet and muddy on the way  _  . You tried to dry your clothes  _  the fire when you got home.  _  you had drunk too much, you  _  on the fire and burnt your knee.
