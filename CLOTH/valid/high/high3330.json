You don't have to  _  your failure if what you really want to achieve is  _  .\nFor every  _  achievement, there have been one or more failures. But those who we call successful are those who  _  to accept failure and believe success is the other side of failure. The incandescent light   was  _  after 1,000 failures. If Thomas Edison had  _  after he tried 100 times without the desired result, what would have been the  _  of such effort?\nAny time you see products and new inventions, think in terms of failures that are not accepted.  _  everything in a microform   today is a result of failure not accepted.\nAny time your effort is not bringing a(n)  _  result, you don't have to call it a failure. Call it a challenge. What is the  _  between the two? One is negative, the other is  _  ; one demotivates , the other motivates.\nWhat you need is positive thinking and motivation to  _  success. Failure is an end thing;  _  is an open thing. Failure means there is no way out, no alternative, but a challenge is a question mark  _  another way out of the situation, an alternative  _  to the problem.\nKeep dreaming, keep moving; that is the solution to success.\nA wise man once said if you cannot fly, run. If you cannot  _  ,walk. If you cannot walk, crawl; just keep moving. If you fall down, you have to  get up  and start moving. If not, other people will step on you towards their  _  . What you call failure and  _  is what someone will step into with just a little additional effort to reach achievement.",
