    "article": "Last winter, when I was heavily pregnant , I was visiting my sister and brother-in-law's house. I had to park my car in a nearby parking lot because they didn't have a place for parking. The snow was extremely heavy and there was lots of  _  on the ground, so not many people dared to go out that evening! When I left their house and  _  to my car around 11pm, I noticed that my car was the only one  _  . Surrounded by silence, I rushed into the car nervously. When I finally tried to  _  away, my wheels began to spin . I realized I was stuck! I wondered what I should do.  _  , in my rear-view mirror , I saw four teenage boys  _  my car. They were walking side by side in a line and behaved a bit like  _  ------ at least I thought that was what they looked like. My car was in a very  _  area and I was so frightened when I saw them. I was certain they were coming to my car to  _  me. Terrified, I just froze. One of the young men tapped on my window  _  and said, \"Excuse me, Madam, would you like some  _  ? You seem to have a problem with the car.\" Still a little afraid, I said, \"I am stuck.\" And the young man said, \"It's okay. Stay in your car and we'll  _  you out of the snow.\" And they did! When they finally got my car out of the snow, they  _  and waved good-bye to me. I rolled down my window and thanked them,  _  to have judged them so poorly. People like to judge the person they come across, and they are in turn judged by others. It's natural that we judge others, but when we do this, we shouldn't  _  the old saying, \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\"",
