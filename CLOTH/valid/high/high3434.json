    "article": "On a bright and cold November morning, Killy Kilford stood on a street corner in downtown Manhattan, watching pedestrians   cross the street quickly. As a woman reached his side of the street, Kilford stopped her   _   and asked, \"What do you think of that street   _  ?\"\nShe   looked up   and smiled. \"I like it.\" It's really nice,\" she said. The sign, which at first   _   looks like any other city street sign, bears an   _   message: \"Listen to your heart.\"\nA few weeks earlier, Kilford and a group of nearly fifty   _   installed 200 \"happy street signs\" in high-traffic areas around New York City. Kilford   _   the signs to look like official street signs but each   _   an inspiring message. After posting the signs, the group began surveying pedestrians for their   _  .\n\"The goal is to   _   people's days through 'little moments of joy',\" Kilford   _  . \"In our daily lives, we are looking at our mobile phones or going to meetings, but I think sometimes people just need a little sign here and there to   _   them that they are great, that they can have a great day and that they are loved. That's what the message is.\"\nBut in some way, signs are ways governments   _   with citizens, and today, much of that communication is prohibitive   : \"No Parking.\" \"No Standing.\" Kilford believes   _   the tone of that conversation to include some positive information could make a   _  . \"if you see a sign that says something different or unexpected,   for example   'Rubbish less, love more', that will be better,\" he explains.\nSo far, Kilford is very encouraged by the feedback   he has   _  . Not everyone likes the idea, of course. One man who was   _   unaware that these signs were completely created by Kilford and his volunteers, called the signs a \"waste of taxpayer money\". But Kilford said they had surveyed more than 600 pedestrians, and that the majority were completely   _  .\nWhat's more, the project catches the   _   of celebrities like Perez Hilton, who is an American blogger and television personality.",
