Real people who live in a  _  world do real things; in other words, the stories are about people just like us doing what we do. Other stories, such as the Harry Potter books, are not  _  . They are characters and creatures that are very different from us and do things that would be impossible for us. But there is more to books and writing than this. If we think about it, even realistic writing is only  _  . How can we tell the difference between what is real and what is not real? For example, when we read about Harry Potter, we do seem to learn something about the real world. And when Harry studies magic at Hogwarts, he also learns more about his real life than  _  . Reading, like writing, is an action. It is a way of thinking. When we read or write something, we do much more than simple look at words on a page. We use our  _  , which is real, and our imagination, which is real in a different way, to make the words come to life in our minds. Both realism and use the imagination and the \"magic\" of reading and writing to make us think. When we read something realistic, we have to  _  that the people we are reading about are just like us, even though we  _  that we are real and they are not. It sounds  _  , but it works. When we read, we fill in missing information and  think about  the causes and effects of what a character does. We help the writer by  _  that what we read is like real life.  In a way  , we are writing the book, too. Most of us probably don't think about what is going on in our  _  when we are reading. We pick up a book and lose ourselves in a good story, eager to find out what will  _  next. Knowing how we feel when we read can help us become better  _  , and it will help us discover more about the real magic of books.",
