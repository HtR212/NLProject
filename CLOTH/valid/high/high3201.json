Through her work, she observed that  _  people spent a lot more time reading than they  _  watching television. She announced that my brother and I could only watch two to three pre-selected TV  _  during the week. With our  _  time, we had to read two books each from the Detroit Public Library and  _  written book reports to her. She would mark them up with check marks and highlights. Years later we realized her marks were a  _  . My mother was illiterate . When I entered high school I was a(n)  _  student, but not for long. I began to like the fancy clothes. I wanted to  hang out with  the guys. I went from being an A-student to a B-student to a C-student. One night my mother came home from her various jobs and I  _  about not having enough Italian knit shirts. She said, \"Okay, I'll give you all the money I have  _  this week scrubbing floors and cleaning bathrooms, and you can buy the family food and pay the bills. With the money  left over  , you can have all the Italian knit shirts you want.\" I was very pleased with that  _  but once I got through allocating money, there was  _  left. I realized my mother was a financial genius to be able to keep the roof over our heads and any kind of food on the table, let alone buy  _  . I also realized that my  _  wasn't going to get me anywhere. Success required intellectual preparation. I went back to my  _  and became an A-student again, and  _  I realized my dream and I became a doctor. My story is really my mother's story--a woman with  _  formal education or property who used her position as a parent to change the lives of many people around, especially her children. There is no job more important than  _  . This I believe.",
