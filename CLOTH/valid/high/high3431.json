We stood still without  _  any noise, all hot and tired. But everyone kept standing as  _  as trees.\nIt was  _  most high schools give to new Senior One students - military training. We  _  four days in a closed environment.  _  we couldn't go home at night and the training was  _  and difficult, our humorous young drillmaster   with a funny accent was a real  _  of our days. We laughed  _  his jokes, sat in rows singing different songs and  listened to  him telling true stories about his life. He gave us the feeling that  _  and sweat were not the only things that military training  _  .\nAfter this journey, We were more  _  than we had imagined and we were much braver than we had  _  . Girls who looked pale rested for a little while, then  right away  came back to the team. Boys who were being punished  _  to the playground at once and began to run. Sweat flowed down our faces  _  we thought about how to shout  _  than other classes.\nMilitary training taught us perseverance   and determination. On the last day of our training, the confidence could be  _  in our faces. We shouted so loud that our  _  could be heard across the heavens. With eyes like burning torches , we walked into the future. Now the sun is  _  at all of us.",
