For the next hour Dad did the dishes, singingfolk songslike\n\"Who Put the Chow in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?\"\nI suppose it was   _  for a boy's father to wear an\napron ----  _  one with race\ncars --- but I never thought much of it  _  the\nday that Dad broke with tradition. It was the last Sunday in August. My father\nseemed in anexpansive(,) mood as we walked home from church together.\n\"Tommy,\" he said letting   my name  roll off his tongue. My\nmind raced ahead of his words: A new bike? A part-time job?  \"There\ncomes a time in every boy's life when he must take on responsibilities.\"\n\"  _  ?\"\nI asked.\n\"Yes. It's time you took a greater role in the household.\" Power tools?

It'll keep your clothes from getting wet.\" And   _  I could mount a protest , he had put the thing on me. \"Thanks, Son. Your mother and I   _  this.\"\nWith that he disappeared into the Sunday paper. I looked down at the plastic. It had seen better days. I could see my dad reaching for the dishes. Soon I was singing about Mrs. Murphy's chowder. And   out of nowhere  I knew the\nkind of man I wanted to be.",
