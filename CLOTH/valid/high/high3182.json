Mr. West stood politely at the edge of a crowd of women who were  _  forward to try to get to the people who were  _  necklaces and earrings. He tried to move forward slowly, taking his turn with the others, but more and more women were  _  nto the shop the whole time and pushing selfishly past him. After half an hour, he was just as far from the people who were selling the necklaces as he had been  when  he came in, and his lunch hour was coming to an end, so he decided to change his  _  of doing things: he put his head down,  _  a sudden loud shout and started to push his way towards the  _  of the crowd as hard as he could.
