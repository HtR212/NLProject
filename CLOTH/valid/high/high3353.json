Army officials offered him a course in\nbecoming a cook. My father   _   because he thought he could   stay away from  \nthe battles. As things turned out, he got good   _   and became head cook of\nan army kitchen.\nAll went well   _   he had to deal with spinach . Because spinach is good for health, the army   _   it several times per week.   _  , the soldiers refused   _   to look at spinach on their plates. After hours of cooking spinach, my father   _   that, at the end of the meal, he was throwing all of it away. To save time and effort, he decided simply to throw away the   _   vegetable before it was cooked.\nOne day an army officer saw the   _   spinach in the rubbish. He blamed my father,   _   that he was destroying government property .   _   my father explained that he was simply   _   the army the trouble of cooking the unwanted vegetable, the army officer insisted on   _   him by taking five dollars from his pay for the next three months.\n    Later, one officer told him that fresh spinach was government property, but cooked spinach was not.   In other words  if the spinach were cooked, it   could  be thrown out. From then on, my father   _   all the spinach and then immediately   _   it into a rubbish can to keep everyone   _  . The government did not have its property thrown out, and the soldiers did not have spinach on their plates.",
