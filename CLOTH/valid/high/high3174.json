    "article": "A Strange Greeting, a True Feeling. Last week I was invited to a doctor's meeting at the Ruth hospital for incurables. In one of the wards a patient, an old man, got up shakily from his bed and moved towards me. I could see that he hadn't long to  _  , but he came up to me and placed his right foot close mine on the floor. \"Frank!\" I cried in astonishment. He couldn't  _  , as I knew, but all the time  _  his foot against mine. My  _  raced back more than thirty years to the  _  days of 1941, when I was a student in London. The  _  was an air-raid shelter, in which I and about hundred other people slept every night. Two of the regulars were Mrs. West and her son Frank.  _  wartime problems, we shelter-dwellers got to  know  each other very well. Frank West  _  me because he wasn't  _  , not even at birth. His mother told me he was 37 then, but he had  _  of a mind than a baby has. His \"  _  --sounds of pleasure or anger and  _  more. Mrs. West, then about 75, was a strong, capable woman, as she had to be, of course, because Frank  _  on her entirely. He needed all the  _  of a baby. One night a policeman came and told Mrs. West that her house had been flattened by a 500-pounder. She  _  nearly everything she owned. When that sort of thing happened, the rest of us helped the  _  ones. So before we  _  that morning, I stood beside Frank and  _  my right foot against his. They were about the same size. That night, then, I took a pair of shoes to the shelter for frank. But as soon as he saw me he came running and placed his right foot against mine. After that, his  _  to me was always the same.",
