    "article": "About 20 years ago, I was lucky to teach a disabled young woman named Audrey. Not only was she good at math and science, but she was also very  _  in art. She could draw and paint beautifully. When Audrey graduated from university, she got two  _  , one in fine arts and one in chemistry. Not too many people do well in two such  _  areas of study. :one in fine arts and one in chemistry. Just before her high school graduation, Audrey  _  me a wonderful gift. It was a watercolour painting of a mother and her baby. A tear  _  from the mother's eye as she looked  _  at her child. Under the painting, Audrey had  _  these words: \"The deep love from Mother,  _  me, touches another.\" What a beautiful gift! I had the piece of art framed and  _  in my office. Years passed with many  _  from one office to another and I  _  the painting. Last year, after about eight years of not knowing where it was, I  _  a phone call from a former colleague who said she had  _  of mine. It was the picture Audrey had painted for me 18 years earlier. When cleaning out a storage room, she had  _  my gift. I was struck that the  _  gift came back. I knew Audrey very well. When she was four years old, Audrey had a serious  _  . What's worse, her father left the house. It was her mother who brought her up with much trouble. She  _  it but was disabled. To  anyone else  , it is just a painting, but to me it shows how a mother's love has helped  _  a talent and how its  _  pushes me ahead.",
