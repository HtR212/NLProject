    "article": "I arrived at my mother's home for our Monday family dinner. Mother was   pulling out   quilt after quilt from the boxes  _   showing me their beauties. She was preparing for a quilt show at the Elmhurst Church. When we began to  _   and put them back into the boxes, I noticed something at the  _  of one box.  \n\"What is this?\" I asked.\n\"Oh?\" Mom said, \"That's Mama's quilt.\" \nI  _  the quilt. It looked as if a group of school children had pieced it together;  _   \ndesigns,   _   pictures, a winding line on the right.\n\"Grandmother made this?\" I said,   _  . My grandmother was a master at making quilts. This     _   didn't look like any of the quilts she had made.\n\"Yes, right before she died. I  _   it home with me last year and made some   _  ,\" she said. \"I'm still   _   on it. See, this is what I've done so far.\"\nI looked at it more   _   . At the center of the quilt, she had sewn a piece of   _   with these words:  \"My mother made many quilts. She didn't get all lines   _   . But I think this is beautiful. I want to see it   _   . Her last quilt.\" \n\"Oh, this is so nice, Mom,\" I said. It  _   to me that by completing my grandmother's quilt, my mother was honoring her own   _   . I realized, too, that I held in my hands a family \n  _   . It started with the loving hands of one woman, and   _   with the loving hands of another.",
