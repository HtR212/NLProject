In fact, this uninvited guest was a bird--- a(n)  _  , to be more precise . \"What's that?\" I asked when I first heard the thump . \"It sounds like Joe is outside playing basketball,\" my wife, Anita, said. She paused and  _  more devotedly. \"It's coming from the  _  .\" she said. \"Maybe it's one of the little  _  \". We rushed out the door. Jonathan, our youngest, was easy to make  _  . \"If he's making holes in the wall again...\" I said as I searched there. No children at all. But there was that  _  again, coming from right up there. And that's when I  _  the sparrow. It was flying  _  just inches below the ceiling. It was clearly trying to  get out  , but couldn't see that the way out wasn't up, but down and out through the open  _  .

I tried to show the bird how to glide down a few feet so it could get outside,  _  that only seemed to frighten it more. \"Why don't we just  _  ?\" Anita suggested. \"I'm sure he'll  _  eventually.\" So we went back into the house, where we continued to hear the ongoing struggle. Then suddenly, it was  _  . We looked into the garage, and our uninvited guest was  _  . \"See?\" Anita said. \"I told you he would make it.\" \"Yeah,\" I said. \"But how many knocks on the head did it  _  him?\" I've thought about that little sparrow through the years. Just like that sparrow, we often meet situations we don't know how to  deal with  . Born to go upward, we don't  _  consider the possibility that something good might happen if we stop flapping around and just glide down a little bit.",
