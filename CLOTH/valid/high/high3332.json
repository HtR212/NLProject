    "article": "For a few years, I have been wearing a ring on my right hand. It's not always the  _  ring, but it's always a ring that has  _  on it so that when I look at it, I'm  _  or reminded of something important. I have made a  _  of buying rings like this whenever I see one in a store. Sometimes I give them away as  _  to someone like Jennie. I first met Jennie in the  _  waiting room and we had talked several times. One night I sat down beside her and  _  how her son was doing because I knew that he was in very  _  condition. She told me that she didn't know what to do any more because it seemed none of the  _  from the doctors was good. They weren't at all sure her son was going to  _  the accident that had hurt him so badly. With  _  \"They're  taking away  my hope.\" I knew then that it was  more than  just a coincidence that I was wearing the ring that I had on that day. As she  _  to talk, I  _  slipped the ring off my finger and placed it in Jennie's hand. I told her to wear it to remember that God loved her and He would be with her  _  all of this.  _  Jennie looked down at the ring, she got excited and then held it tightly,  _  the word written on the ring was \"HOPE\". The last day I was at the hospital, I saw Jennie in the distance as I got on the lift. She  _  and held up the hand with the ring on it as she called out to me saying, \"Look, I  _  have Hope!\"",
