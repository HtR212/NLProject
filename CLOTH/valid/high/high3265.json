Falling down some steps, he  knocked over  three priceless Qing Dynasty vases, which fell to the ground and broke into more than 400 pieces. He was sitting there in  _  when the museum staff arrived. Everyone stood around in silence --- only the man kept pointing to the  _  , saying, \"There it is! That's what made me fall.\" Man has been blaming others at least since Adam blamed Eve, and Eve blamed the serpent . Roman emperors liked to kill  _  who brought bad news; and in the Middle Ages a prince would often be given a \"whipping boy\" --- an unlucky servant who could be  _  whenever his master had misbehaved. Today, you'll see how blaming others has turned into big  _  business. In one famous case, McDonald's was ordered to pay $2.7 million to a woman who  _  burned herself with hot coffee. Although the amount was later  _  to $480,000, this case  _  businesses so much that they began to create  _  for their products that even an idiot would understand. For example, \"Hot coffee can be dangerous\" (take away coffee cups) and \"Don't pour liquids into your television set\" (instruction booklet).",
