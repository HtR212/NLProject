    "article": "Throughout history man has had to accept the fact that all living things must die. But people now live longer than they  used to  . Yet, all living things still show the  _  of aging, which will eventually  result in  death.\nAging is not a disease, but as a person passes maturity  , the cells of the body and the  _  they form do not function as well as they  did  in childhood and teenage years. The body provides less  _  against disease and is more  _  to have an accident.\nA number of related causes may  _  to aging. Some cells of the body have a fairly long life, but they are not  _  when they die. As a person ages,  the number  of brain cells and muscle cells decreases.  Other  body cells die and are replaced by new cells. In an aging person the  _  cells may not be as workable or as capable  _  growth as those of a young person.\nAnother  _  in aging may be changes within the cells  themselves  . Some of the protein  chemicals in cells are known  to change  with age and become less elastic  . This is why the skin of old people wrinkles and  becomes loose  . This is also the reason why old people  _  in height. There may be other more important chemical changes in the cells. Some complex cell chemicals, such as DNA and RNA, store and  pass on  information that the cells need. Aging may affect this  _  and change the information carrying molecules  so that they do not transmit the information as well.",
