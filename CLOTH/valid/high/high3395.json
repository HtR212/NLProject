    "article": "As I lay on the table enjoying my monthly massage  , I was grateful for a chance to relax. While I felt the caring   _   of the massage therapist  , I listened to recordings of music   _   only a few centuries ago for royalty and the very rich. Violin was complemented   by   _   piano music; in my imagination, these gifted artists were   _   just for me. \n I pay $80 for an hour-long massage. How much is it really   _   to me? $500? $1,000? I could never   _   that amount every month, but if suddenly a massage cost $500 or $1,000 at minimum, I realized that I would still   save up   and get a massage every year or two as a special   _  .  \n When the massage was   _  , I told my massage therapist how   _   I was for her work, how much this time   _   to me. Her massages are worth far more than $80 to me--$500 or $1,000,   _  . While I can't afford that   _  , I paid her an extra $100 this month   on condition   that she wouldn't put it in the bank or pay her bills with it. I   _   that she spend it on something extraordinary for herself she wouldn't purchase   _  , like a special article of clothing or something beautiful for her home. \n She   _   for joy suddenly. It's not at the gift itself, but at the   _   behind it. At last she said she couldn't think out the   _   she could spend the money immediately, and that she would be sure to tell me about what she ended up deciding on. \"You don't have to tell me,\" I said. \"It will give me even more   _   to tell you,\" she replied.",
