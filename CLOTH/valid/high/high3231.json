    "article": "Because conflict and disagreements are part of all close relationships, couples need to learn strategies for managing conflict in a healthy and constructive way. Some couples just  _  and deny the presence of any conflict in a relationship.  _  ,denying the existence of conflict results in couples  _  to solve their problems at early  _  ,which can then lead to even greater problems later on .Not surprisingly, expressing anger and disagreement leads to lower marital satisfaction at the beginning. However, this pattern of behavior  _  increases in marital satisfaction over time. Research suggests that working through conflicts is an important predictor of marital satisfaction. So, what can you do to manage conflict in your own relationships? First, try to understand the other person's point of view  _  put yourself in his of her place. People who are  _  to what their partner thinks and feels  _  greater relationship satisfaction. For example, researchers found that among people in dating relationships  as well as  marriages, those who can adopt their partner's perspective show more positive emotions, more relationship-enhancing attributes and more constructive responses  _  conflict. Second, because conflict and disagreements are an  _  part of close relationships,people need to be able to apologize to their partner for wrongdoing and  _  forgiveness from their partners for their own acts. Apologies minimize conflict, lead to forgiveness, and serve to restore relationship closeness. In line with this view, spouses who are more forgiving show higher mental quality over time. Increasingly, apologizing can even have  _  health benefits. For example, when people reflect on hurtful  _  and grudges ,they show negative physiological effects, including  _  heart rate and blood pressure, compared to when they reflect on sympathetic perspective-taking and forgiving.",
