    "article": "In 2010, Robert Geoffrey Edwards was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. A newspaper reporter interviewed him why he was able to be so much more creative than the average person. \nHe   _   that, in his opinion, it all came from an   _   with his mother that happened when he was about 2 years old.He had been trying to 23 _  a bottle of milk from the refrigerator when he lost his   _   on the slippery bottle and it   _  , making its contents pouring all over the kitchen floor.\nWhen his mother came into the kitchen, instead of   _  at him, giving him a lecture, or punishing him, she said: \"Edwards, what a   _   and wonderful mess you have made! I have   _   seen such a huge pool of milk.Well, the damage has already been done.Would you like to   _   down and play in the milk for a few minutes   _  we clean it up?\"\nIndeed, he did.After a few minutes, his mother said: \"You know, Edwards,   _   you make a mess like this, you have to clean it up   at last   and restore everything to its proper order.So, how would you like to do that? We could use a sponge  , a towel, or a mop.Which do you   _  ?\" He chose the sponge and together they   cleaned up   the milk.\nHis mother then said: \"You know, what happened just now is a   _  experiment in how effectively to carry a big milk bottle with two   _  hands.Let's go out in the backyard and fill the bottle with water and see if you can 37 _  a way to carry it without dropping it.\" The little boy   _  that if he held the bottle at the top near the lip with both hands, he could carry it without dropping it.\nThis scientist then   _  that it was at that moment that he knew he didn't need to be afraid to make   _  .\nWouldn't it be great if all parents would respond the way Edwards's mother responded to him?",
