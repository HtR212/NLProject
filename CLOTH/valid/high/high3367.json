The other day I was feeling quite  _  , having just been laid off from my job. With so many  _  to pay, I was wondering what was going to happen to my family. I got off the bus when I heard piano music and singing rising above the noise of the  _  . I walked a bit slower, trying to find out where it was coming from. Through the  _  I saw a young lady sitting at a piano with a box next to her. She was singing songs about love and her sweet voice  _  me a bit. Then I stood there watching her playing, thinking that it must take  _  to perform on her own in front of hundreds of people she didn't know. She might have felt my  _  for she occasionally looked in my direction. By now I was telling myself that I could at least tell her how good she sounded. I walked  _  and put some money in her box and she expressed her thanks with a smile on her face. I asked her  _  , \"Why are you playing the piano in the middle of this crowded place?\" She explained to me that she sees so many  _  people in the world that she is trying to relieve the pain by  _  motivational music. Instead of continuing my way home, I said to her, \"I have been going through a  _  time lately, but you've made me  _  again.\" \"I'm happy that I could be  _  to you,\" she replied. \"Why are you so sad?\" I told her my story and said, \"I'm not so  _  about what to do....\" \"You see, here's the  _  ,\" she responded. \"When you were walking, your head was down.\" She looked me in the eyes and went on, \"Don't look defeated, because  _  comes in different ways and if your head is down you might never see it. You should  _  more ... lift your head up.\" I was really  _  by what she said! I did hold my head up and soon got through the difficult time. So  _  in trouble, just face it bravely and you are sure to overcome your difficulty sooner or later.",
