Why do these people create mistrust and problems, especially with those from other  _  ? \nI was growing up in Kuala Lumpur in the early 1960s,   _  children from different races and religions played and studied   _  in harmony. At that time my family lived a stone's   _  from Ismail's. And no one was bothered that Ismail was a Malay Muslim and I was an Indian Hindu--we just   _  our differences. Perhaps,our elders had not filled our heads with unnecessary advice, well   _  or otherwise.\nWe were nine when we became friends. During the school holidays, we 'd   _  the countryside on our bicycles,hoping to   come across   the unexpected. At times Ismail would accompany my family as we made a rare shopping trip to town. We would be glad of his   _  .\nWhen I was twelve, my family moved to Johor. Ismail's family later returned to their village, and I   _   touch with him.\nOne spring afternoon in 1983, I stopped a taxi in Kuala Lumpur. I   _   my destination. The driver acknowledged my  _   but did not move off. Instead, he looked   _    at me. \"Raddar?\" he said, using my childhood nickname  .I was astonished at being so   _   addressed  .Unexpectedly! It was Ismail! Even after two   _   we still recognized each other. Grasping his shoulder, I felt a true affection, something   _  to describe.\nIf we can allow our children to be   _  without prejudice, they'll build friendships with people,regardless of race or religion, who will be   _  their side through thick and thin. On such friendships are societies built and   _   we can truly be, as William Shakespeare once wrote, \"We happy few, We band of brothers\".",
