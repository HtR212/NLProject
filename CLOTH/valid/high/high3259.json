I then  _  she had no arms or legs, just a head, neck and  _  body. She was wearing a little white dress with red dots. As the couple  _  her up to me I was looking down at the register. I turned my head toward the girl and gave her a wink . As I took the money from her grandparents, I looked back at the girl, who was giving me the cutest, largest smile I have ever seen.\nAll of a sudden her  _  was gone and all I saw was this beautiful girl, whose smile just  _  me and almost instantly gave me a completely new  _  of what life is all about. She took me from a poor, unhappy college student and brought me into her world: a world of  _  , love and  _  .\nThat was ten years ago.
