These things have come to represent , in fact, what I call   _  and\nlove.\nI don't remember my father ever getting into swimming pool. But he   _  the water. Any\nkind of  _  ride seemed to give him pleasure.  _  he\nloved to fish; sometimes he took me along.\nBut I never really liked being on the water, the way my father did. I liked being   _  the\nwater, moving through it,  _  it all around me. I was not a\nstrong  _  , or one who learned to swim early, for I had my  _  . But I loved being in the swimming pool close to my father's office and  _  those summer days with my father, who  would  come by\non a break. I needed him to see what I could do. My father would stand there in\nhis suit, the  _  person not in swimsuit.\nAfter swimming, I would go   inside  his office and sit on the wooden chair in front of his big desk,\nwhere he let me  play with  anything I found in his top desk drawer . Sometimes, if I was left alone at his desk   while  he worked in the lab, an assistant or a student might come in and\ntell me perhaps I shouldn't be playing with his  office things  . But my father\nalways  showed up  and said easily, \" Oh, no, it's  _  .\"\nSometimes he handed me coins and told me to get  myself  an ice\ncream...\nA poet once said, \"We look at life once, in childhood; the rest is  _  .\" And I think it is not only what we \"look at once,\nin childhood\" that determines our memories, but  _  , in that childhood, looks at us.",
