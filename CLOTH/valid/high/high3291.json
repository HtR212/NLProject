    "article": "I was almost sixteen years old when I first began to work for the media . It was 1992   _  I first went inside the Hungarian  state television building. I remember it   _  . I felt so small while everything was so  _  and I felt that everything was out of my reach. I was amazed to be inside this building where everything happened, and where people's clothing was always nice. I felt that it was a place where the people knew  _  .\nAt that time I was in media school, and Ms. Agnes Daroczi, then the editor of Patrin, came to my school and  _  me to audition  to be a host in her program. Agnes Daroczi was an excellent Romanian activist in Hungary who   _  well-known in the late 1980s. After a short training, I was on the screen almost every week for five years. After I   graduated from  high school in 1993, I began to work full-time   _   an editor and host for Patrin. One year later, in 1994, the editor of a popular cultural   _  before the evening news asked me to   work for  them as well. I became he first Romanian person in Hungary to   _   as a host on mainstream television.\n     My heart was in the Romanian program. Of course I also worked for the cultural new,   _  the greater part of my  _  went into the program for Romania. I brought Romanian cultural affairs into the other program as well. There was a big difference   _  the two programs. On the other40 _ , it was also a big task for me. However, I have overcome all the difficulties and I hope that I will become as well-known as Ms. Agnes Daroczi.",
