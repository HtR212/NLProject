    "article": "My daughter has been crazy about raising a pet for a long time. Last spring I bought two newly-hatched chickens for her. She got  _  and took good care of them.  _  , a few days later, both chickens died. She burst into tears because of  their death  .I helped her  _  the two birds under a tree behind our house. I thought it would be the  _  of her ideas.  _  , I was wrong . Children are children  after all  . The failure hasn't  _  my daughter in any way. She still tried to keep a small animal or even a snail. One day last winter, I noticed under the eaves of the house a family of sparrows . My daughter and I could  _  the sparrows as our \"pets\", but we didn't. So I told her to  _  the grains on the windowsill . A few minutes later, the sparrows came to land on the windowsill  one after another  and pecked at the rice. Suddenly my daughter asked me, Mum, can we catch and  _  the sparrows, and let them live with us in the room? How  _  it is for them to live outside? \"Oh, my dear. I do not think it's a good idea. You know,\" I explained to her, \"the sparrow is a bird who loves  _  .No one can keep them in a cage. If they are caught, they will  _  quickly. They are  _  to living outside. Moreover, they have warm nest under the eaves. From then on, we have set up a kind of  _  with the sparrow family. We feed them frequently and  _  them as pet birds. However, we do not need to  possess  them. We  enjoy  seeing these little birds flying and jumping among branches, leaves and flowers in the spring morning.",
