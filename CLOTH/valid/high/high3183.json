    "article": "Evelyn Glennie was the first lady of solo percussion in Scot-land. In an interview, she recalled how she became a percussion soloist ( )in spite of her disability.\n\"Early on I decided not to allow the  _  of others to stop me from becoming a musician. I grew up on a farm in northeast Scotland and began  _  piano lessons when I was eight. The older I got, the more my passion  for music grew. But I also began to gradually lose my  _  . Doctors concluded that the nerve damage was the  _  and by age twelve, I was completely deaf. But my love for music never  _  me.\n\"My  _  was to become a percussion soloist, even though there were none at that time. To perform, I  _  to 'hear' music differently from others. I play in my stocking feet and can  _  the pitch of a note  by the vibrations  I feel through my body and through my  _  . My entire sound world exists by making use of almost every  _  that I have.\n\" I was  _  to be assessed as a musician, not as a deaf musician, and I applied to the famous Royal Academy of Music in Lon-don. No other deaf student had  _  this before and some teachers  _  my admission. Based on my performance, I was  _  admitted and went on to  _  with the academy's highest honors. \"\n\"After that, I established myself as the first full-time solo percussionist. I  _  and arranged a lot of musical compositions since  _  had been written specially for solo percussionists.\n\"I have been a soloist for over ten years.  _  the doctor thought I was totally deaf, it didn't  _  that my passion couldn't be realized. I would encourage people not to allow themselves to be  _  by others. Follow your passion ; follow your heart. They will lead you to the place you want to go. \"",
