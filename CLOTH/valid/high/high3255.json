    "article": "I'd like to tell you a story my grandmother told me when I was six or seven years old. We had to go to her home for Thanksgiving dinner and the  _   was rather a long one. I had filled the time with making a   _  of all the things that I wanted for Christmas that year.\nLater I showed the list to my grandmother. After she read it, she said, \"That  _  is a long list!\" Then she told me this story:\n\"Once there was a little girl who came to live in an orphanage . As Christmas time  _  , all of the other children began   _  the little girl about the beautiful Christmas tree that would appear in the huge downstairs  _  on Christmas morning. Each child would be given their one and only Christmas gift, a small, single  _  .\"\n\"The headmaster of the orphanage was very  _  , so when he caught the little girl climbing down the stairs to look at the Christmas tree in the hall, he sharply   _  that the little girl would not   _  her Christmas orange because she had been to   _  as to disobey the rules. The little girl ran back to her room  _  and crying. The next morning as the other children were going down to breakfast, the little girl stayed in her bed. She couldn't stand the   _  of seeing the others receive their gift when there would be   _  for her. Later, as the children came back, the little girl was  _  to be handed a napkin . As she carefully   _  it, there to her disbelief was an orange all peeled and sectioned. \"It was then that she imagined  _  each child had taken one section from their orange and given it to her so that she, too, would have a Christmas orange.\"\nHow I  _  this story! I would ask my grandmother to tell it to me over and over as I   grew up  . How I wish the world, as a whole world display that same kind of  _  for others, not just at Christmas, but throughout the year.",
