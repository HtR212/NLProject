She came over,   _  her tongue over my hand carefully,  _  herself to be scratched for a time, waved her tail and lay down again. I remembered thinking there are times God puts a   _  in front of you. I took the dog.\nShe was   _  when she\nunderstood the news,  _  up to kiss my face. To get her home\nsafely, I had to  _  her like a baby. She lay in my arms,\neyes calmly  _  on mine as if to say, \"Hey, this is a nice\nidea. Why didn't you think of it before?'\nI named the dog Elizabeth. Height: about 30 inches. Weight: 35 pounds. Eyes: brown. Tongue: rich. She never barked. In 14 years, I heard her voice  no more than  three times.\nAt night Liz and I stayed up   _  dawn , watching TV. She liked   _  than to sit at my  _  .\n         After a while, my place became a dog's room. She kept herself   _  .\nShe also ran away  at times  . If you opened a door or window, she\nwas out of it. It was a good thing I lived on the  _  floor.\n         Liz loved to run, that was it. I would take her to a  _  sports\nground, and she would run at full speed. Then I'd  _  her in\nthe back of the car,  _  she'd sleep. It was a dog's, too.",
