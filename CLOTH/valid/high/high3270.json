    "article": "I believe that families are not only blood relatives, but sometimes people who show up and love you when no one else will. In May 1977, I was living in a Howard Johnson's motel off Interstate 10 in Houston. My dad and I  _  a room with two double beds and a bathroom was too  _  for a 15-year-old girl and her father. Dad's second marriage was  in trouble  and my stepmother had  _  us both out of the house the previous week. Dad had no  _  what to do with me. And that's when my other family  showed up  . Barbara and Roland Beach took me into their home  _  their only daughter, Su, my best friend, asked them to. I  _  with them for the next seven years. Barbara washed my skirts the same as Su's. She  made sure  I had lunch money, doctors' appointments, help with homework and nightly hugs. Barbara and Roland attended every football game where Su and I were being cheerleaders.  As far as  I could tell, for the Beaches there was no  _  between Su and me; I was their daughter, too. When Su and I  left for  college they kept my room the same for the entire four years I attended school. Recently, Barb presented me with an insurance policy they bought when I first moved in with them and had continued to pay on for 23 years. The Beaches knew  _  about me when they took me in - they had heard the whole story from Su. When I was seven, my mother died and from then on my father relied on other people to  _  his kids. Before I went to live with the Beaches I had believed that life was entirely  _  and that love was shaky and untrustworthy. I had believed that the only person who would take care of me was me.  But for  the Beaches, I would have become a bitter, cynical woman. They gave me a(n)  _  that allowed me to grow and change. They kept me from being paralyzed(,) by my  _  and they gave me the confidence to open my heart. I  believe in  family. For me, it wasn't the family that was there on the day I was  _  , but the one that was there for me when I was living in a Howard Johnson's on Interstate 10.",
