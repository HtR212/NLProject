I  _  every tag  and felt every package so that I could even  _  which present went to which person.\nIt had been a tough year for my family. When Mom was  _  the gifts, she sighed and warned us, \"There won't be much for Christmas this year. Try not to be  _  \" In the past, the presents would pile up and  _  cover the living room floor.\nOn Christmas morning, we eagerly waited until Dad told us everything was   _  . We rushed into the living room and made the wrapping paper  _  \n\"Here's another one for you,\" said Mom as she  _  me a package. I looked at it, confused. Having  _  so much time examining the present before Christmas, I  _  this one. But it should have been Mom's. A new  _  had been put on it,  _  my name written in my mother's handwriting.\n\"Mom, I can't...\"\nI was  _  by my mother's joyful look- a look I could not really understand. \"Let's see  _  it is , honey. Hurry and open it. \"\nIt was a hair dryer.  _  this may be a simple gift for other people, to me it was so much more. Being an eleven-year-old girl, I was  _  .
