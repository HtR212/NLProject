Then four years ago, our youngest  _  went to school and I thought I might go back to  _  .\nMy husband was very  _  and helped me to make my decision.He pointed out all of the things I can do around the  _  , and said he thought I could be a great  _  in business.After several weeks of job-hunting, I found my  _  job, which is working for a small public relations firm.At first, my husband was very  _  of me and would tell his friends, \"My clever little wife can  _  that company she's working for.\"\nBut as his joking words were close to  _  , my husband stopped talking to me about my job.I have received several promotions and pay increases, and I am now  _  more money than he is.I can buy my  _  clothes and a new car.Because of our joint incomes, my husband and I can do many things that we had always  _  of doing, but we don't do these things because he is very  _  .\nWe  _  about little things and my husband is very critical of me in front of our friends.For the first time in our marriage, I think there is a possibility that our marriage may come to a(an)  _  .\nI love my husband very much, and I do not want him to  _  lower, but I also love my job.I think I can be a good wife and a working woman, but I don't know  _  .Can you give me some  _  ? Will I have to choose one or the other or can I keep both my  _  and my new career?\nPlease help.\n\"DISTRESSED\"",
