My son is 7 years old and he was  preparing for  a show to be put on at his school. He was playing the role of an angel. On the evening before the show, he asked me, \"Mom, can we  _  angels?\" As usual, I seized the  _  to teach him to be positive and I said, \"Yes, but only those who are perfect, and think and talk positively can.\" He asked, \"You must have seen them then?\" I was  _  for a few seconds, not knowing what to say. I was touched by his  _  that his mother was a perfect person. He looked into my eyes,  _  a positive answer. I chose to be  _  with him and told him, \"No. I've not been a good person all the time.\" I was almost  _  to admit this to him. I thought that his  _  of a perfect mother would now surely be torn into pieces. But he  _  it positively and said, \"It's all right. You know to try to be better from now on.\" I smiled as I replied, \" That's  _  . Sometimes, we might make a  _  , but when we do, we must always try to do better.\" My son's  _  struck me right in my heart and are always with me. I learned a good lesson that day \"to always try to be better.\" This will always  _  me in all situations where I'll need to be positive.",
