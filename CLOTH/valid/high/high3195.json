    "article": "I used to love to watch my high school track team train -- especially the long-distance runners. But that year, my eyes were  _  to a girl whose running style was all wrong. She ran with her arms tucked close to her body, bouncing up and down in a way that must have driven her  _  crazy. My athletic mind laughed at her strange style, and I began to think  _  her as \"the Bouncer\". In early May, my high school  _  a big sports meeting. A large group of athletes joined in the two-mile running race -- including the Bouncer. As the race progressed, she quickly fell far  _  the pack and every runner lapped her at least once before it was over. But she just kept running,  _  up and down -- and always wearing the same smile. \"That poor kid,\" I thought. \"There was nothing to be  _  by finishing so far behind the pack. Why didn't she just  give up  ?\" Still, she never stopped, and her smile never changed. But a short while later, something  _  began to happen. As she entered the home stretch , a cheer began to rise, growing louder with each step the Bouncer took toward the finish line until, finally, every person in the stands stood and cheered  as if  the fate of the whole race depended on this one lone girl, bouncing toward the finish line. The Bouncer just  _  to run exactly as she'd been doing from the beginning. As she crossed the finish line, the teacher walked out onto the  _  and held her arms tightly. I've seen hundreds of races since that day, and I've seen thousands of runners  _  the finish line. But I've never seen anything that showed the true spirit of  _  as I watched on that warm spring day so long ago, when I saw a race won by a girl I had  _  called the Bouncer",
