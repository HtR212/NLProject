    "article": "Most people have at least heard of one story or another involving someone who seemingly died of a broken heart, but is that   _  ? Could it be that the proper functioning of our immune system is directly connected to love, or   _   by that? Surely it is true. When I was a child I   heard of   my grandparents' story and how they followed each other closely in   _  .\nHow we deal with love or the loss of it mainly   depends on   our psychological   habits, but the consequences of our joys and   _   can be seen in the way our body functions. We all have an endocrine   system, which is   made up of   several glands  , such as the pineal gland, pituitary gland and thymus  gland etc. The   _   of your thymus directly shows the state of your overall health as well as your ability to   _   infection and keep energy levels. Now, the heart is   _   to be an organ that is actually associated with love and other   _  . When someone is   _   he will most likely suffer from things like sadness or worry, which are known to cause   _   damage to the body if the   _   lasts for long periods of time. Perhaps this   _   between love and the immune system explains why we feel   _   ill when our feelings are hurt.\nAs the story in my   _   goes: my grandparents   _   each other deeply, which meant that when one of them passed away, the other also   _   a lot. It destroyed the other's immune system, and even resulted in the other's death.   _  , we need to be optimistic as this will surely help us to live longer.",
