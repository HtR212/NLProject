    "article": "A poor young man lost his job and had no one to help him. Helpless, homeless and hopeless, he decided to commit suicide. He   _   all the coins he had with him and bought a ripe banana wrapped in an old newspaper. He opened the packet and started to eat his last food   _   an old beggar approached him. With trembling lips, the beggar told him that he hadn't had anything to eat for several days and was too weak to walk. The young man felt   _  . So he didn't eat the banana.   _  , he gave the banana to the beggar. The beggar ate it with great joy and   _   him. While leaving, the beggar gave him a very old coin, saying, \"Thank you very much. You gave me everything you had. Kindly accept this coin as my gift   in return for   your kindness.\"\nAfter the old man left, he   _   glanced at the piece of paper used to wrap the fruit. There he saw a(n)43 _  from an agency dealing with old coins. Anyone   _   old coins was invited to visit the agency and receive suitable price for their old coins on the spot. Out of simple   _  , he carried the coin to the agency after   _   it by phone. He showed the coin gifted by the beggar. The person who   _   the agency stared at it and told him in excitement, \"What a   _   ! It is very   _   and several centuries old. It is worth a(n) 50 _  !\" Jumping with joy on receiving the   _   amount of money, he searched everywhere to find the old man who gifted him the coin. He wanted to   _   his joy and the money with the beggar. But he could not find him anywhere. Since then, he started a new life with renewed   _   and enthusiasm about the future.\nKindness will be   _  . It always comes back! As William Wordsworth wrote,\" The best part of a good life is the little, nameless, unremembered acts of   _   and love.\"",
