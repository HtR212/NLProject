On the other hand, if you believe in your  _  , and if he tells that you are going to feel better, you probably will. The effect of the mind upon the body  does exist  and sometimes can be powerful. It exists  whether  one is aware of it or not. Take the case of Mrs. Green, for example. She  was unable to  get to sleep at night and was too tired during the day to do some  _  things that she used to enjoy doing. She had headaches more often which prevented her from reading or watching TV. The more she thought about conditions,  the worse  she felt. At last she went to see her doctor, whom she had known  for years  . The doctor listened to her and gave her a very  careful examination  . Then he said to her. \"There is  nothing seriously  wrong with you physically,  _  I accept the fact that you don't feel well. I'm going to give you some  _  that should help. I want you to  _  one after dinner and one half an hour  _  going to bed tonight. Call me tomorrow and tell me  _  you feel.\" The next day Mrs. Green  _  , \"Doctor, I had the first  _  night's sleep in two months night.  _  is in this pills?\" The doctor said, \"It's an old formula I have  _  for years. Just keep on taking them for a week.\" Turning to the nurse, he said, \"It's  _  what a little baking soda can do!\"",
