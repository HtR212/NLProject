    "article": "In modern society loneliness can be seen as a social phenomenon and people can experience loneliness for many reasons. It is a very common,  _  normally temporary, consequence of a breakup, divorce, or loss of any important  _  relationship. In these cases, loneliness may  _  both from the loss of a specific person or from dropping  dropping out  of social circles. The loss of a significant person in one's life will  _  lead to a grief response; in this situation, one might feel lonely, even while in the  _  of others.\nThere are many different ways used to treat loneliness. The first step that most doctors  _  to patients is treatment. Short term treatment typically  _  over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During treatment, emphasis is put  _  understanding the cause of the problem, thoroughly changing the  _  thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel  _  . Some doctors also recommend group treatment a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system.\n  Another  treatment is animal-assisted treatment. Studies and surveys indicate that the  _  of animal companions such as dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs can  _  feelings of loneliness or depression among some sufferers.  _  the companionship the animal itself provides there may also be increased opportunities for  _  with other pet owners. Results of a study also suggest that  _  improper socialcognition   offers the best chance of reducing loneliness.\n  _  , loneliness can sometimes play an important role in the creative process. In some people, temporary or prolonged loneliness can lead to remarkable artistic and creative expression, for example, as was the  _  with poet Emily Dickinson, and many musicians. This is not to imply that loneliness itself ensures this creativity,  _  , it may have an influence on the subject matter of the artist and more likely be present in individuals engaged in creative activities.",
