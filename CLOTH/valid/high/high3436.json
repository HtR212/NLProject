    "article": "The Fitting-in of Suzy Khan The first time I saw Suzy Khan, I knew I had to help her. She was really small for her age of 12. The boy in my class often  _  about her and laughed their heads off. She would open a book, pretending to read, with tears dropping on the open page. All I knew was that she was an orphan from Africa. She had just been adopted by a family in town who  _  that the best way for her to learn American ways of life was to be with American kids. I looked down at this  _  girl and promised myself that somehow I would help her. But how could I help her  _  in with us? There had to be a  _  . One day, when I went into the classroom, I saw that Suzy had  _  her geography book to a picture of a train, and in her notebook, she had made a(n)  _  copy. I was surprised and thought that she could do something in the coming  _  show. So, I took her to see the art teacher, Miss Parker, and showed her what Suzy had  _  . \"why, it's wonderful,\" said Miss Parker, who then showed us a poster she had painted  _  the talent show. \"I need more of these, but I just don't have enough  _  . Could you help me, Suzy?\" On the day of the talent show, Suzy's  _  were everywhere ----all over the hall and all over the school, each one different. \"And finally,\" said Mr. Brown, the schoolmaster, at the end of the show, \"we have a (n)  _  award. I'm sure you've all noticed the wonderful posters.\" Everyone nodded. \"One of our own students  _  them.\" I could hear everyone whispering. \"Who in our school could draw  _  well?\" Mr. Brown waited a while before saying, \"  _  is student worked so hard on the posters, she deserves a  _  , too. Our mystery artist is our new student ---- Suzy Khan!\" Mr. Brown thanked her for all the wonderful posters and gave her a professional artist's set. \"Thank you,\" she cried. I  _  at that time when I was looking at her excited face, she'd probably never  _  anything in her whole life. Everyone started to  _  their hands. Suzy Khan gave them a shy smile and the applause was deafening. I knew then Suzy was going to be all right.",
