    "article": "I had arrived at the airport about 30 minutes before the check-in. It had been a very busy three days for me with lots of meetings. So I was  _  to have the extra time to make my notes on what I needed to do the  _  day. But then  _  the announcement that my flight had to be delayed  _  there was a problem with the plane.\nAs I sat waiting for my flight  to be called  I reflected on my last meeting of the day. It was not a business meeting  _  rather a very enjoyable lunch with an old business friend I had not seen for over 12 years. Our lunch was spent recalling times  gone by  as well as filling each other in on what  had happened  in our lives over the last 12 years. We both laughed and smiled as we recalled the good times and the great  _  we had shared together. At the end of our time together, we both said  how much  we had enjoyed it and  _  we must do it again.\nIt was great to have this additional time to  _  in my mind all that we had talked about. I realized just how important it is to have regular  _  of the good times in your life. I was lucky enough to  have had  the chance to take a short break and reflect on the good things that had happened in my life over 12 years.\nIt was  _  like looking at an old photo album stored away in a cupboard in your house. There before your eyes are lots of wonderful memories that  _  you back to times and places, and most importantly  _  those people who are in the photos.\nMy flight  _  was finally called three hours later. I smiled as I boarded the plane and realized that I was  not a bit  upset about the delay in the flight,as I had been able to spend the time  _  on the good times from days gone by.",
