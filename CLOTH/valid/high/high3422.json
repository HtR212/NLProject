On difficult days during high school, she'd offer me her favorite chocolate when I returned home. During my 20s, Mom often called to suggest a   _  lunch at the park just to celebrate a warm, sunny day.  A handwritten thank-you   _  arrived after every single visit my parents   _  to my home, reminding me of how   _  I was to them.\nOne morning in my 30s, my father phoned me with confusion and   _  .  \"Mary, something's wrong with your mother. Please come over as   _  as possible.\"\nThe l0-minute drive filled me with   _  ,  wondering what was happening to my mother. When I arrived, I found Mom   _  on the bed, with her eyes closed.  I called to her, trying to keep my voice as calm as possible.\n\"Mom, I'm here.\"\n\"Mary, I hurt so much; am I going to die?\"\nWhen I heard it, I  _  ,not knowing what to say. I paused for a moment that seemed like a million years, waiting for the   _   to come. Tears   _   up as I looked at my loving mother lying there so   _  .  I sat down beside her, picked up her hand and said, \"Mom, when it   _  , squeeze my hand and I'll tell you that I love you.\"\nMany hand squeezes and I-love-you passed between my mother and me during the next two years until she   passed away  from cancer.",
