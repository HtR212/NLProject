    "article": "A few days ago, my sister Liz and I talked about Dad, and we decided to get him a little something for Father's Day. We talked about the times when we were  _  up and how Mom and Dad used to play the 'good cop, bad cop' thing on us. Dad has been a person of few words since we were  _  . He raised us more by  _  than anything else. When he spoke, though we listened, he was always mysterious and difficult to understand. There was always a(n)  _  meaning that I never got, but Liz always  _  to decipher him. By the time I got to high school, I had wanted a skateboard and I  _  I was too old to ask money from my parents, so I worked at a burger joint . One day, I was really angry about annoying burgers. I came home huffing and puffing . Dad saw me and asked me what was the  _  . I told him that I was fed up with annoying burgers. He said that we all have to start somewhere, that we may not know it now, but the skills we learn even in a burger joint might come in handy  _  in life, 'Who knows, you might end up having to run a  _  or even own one when you grow up,' said Dad. He  _  me down and I kept what he said in mind, even though I really didn't agree with it. A couple of years later, when I got to college, I worked in a restaurant. During one of the really  _  days that we had, we were short on kitchen staff. Our customers were getting impatient and the  _  were getting delayed. We were sure any minute something terrible would  _  out. I couldn't stand the  _  any more, so I rolled up my sleeves, got myself a hair net and helped out in the hot kitchen. We caught up with the orders  _  . The owner saw what I did and called me over around  _  time. He said that he was very  _  . He raised my salary and made me the assistant manager even though I could only go part-time. That was  _  I realized that what my dad said to me all those years before was absolutely true. I've never forgotten what my dad said that day. And whenever I have to do something that requires new skills, no matter how insignificant or  _  it seems, I have a new perspective that it might really help me later on or even right now and I just don't know it. Experience is everything and it  _  a lot when you take lessons from it. That's my life's philosophy.",
