Finally one night, I shouted out as her, \"Don't do that any more - your hands are too  _  !\" She didn't say anything in reply. But never again did my mother  end up  my day with that familiar  _  of her love. With the years passing, my thoughts  _  to that night, when I missed my mother's hands, missed her goodnight  _  on my forehead. Sometimes the incident seemed very  _  , while sometimes far away. But always it was hidden in the back of my  _  . Now Mom is in her seventies, and those hands that I  _  thought to be so rough are still doing things for me and my  _  . And now my own children are grown and gone. One Thanksgiving Eve,  _  I slept in the bedroom of my youth, a  _  hand hesitantly run across my face to  _  the hair from my forehead. Then a kiss, ever so  _  , touched my brow. In my memory, for the thousandth time, I recalled the night and my young voice  _  . \"Don't do that any more - your hands are too rough!\"  All at once  , I caught Mom's hand in hand, saying how  _  I was for that night. I thought she'd remember, as I did. But Mom didn't know  _  I was talking about. She had forgotten, and forgiven long ago. That night, I fell asleep with a new  _  for my gentle mother and her caring hands. And the guilt that I had carried around for so long was nowhere to be found.",
