    "article": "I had a very special teacher in high school many years ago whose husband died suddenly of a heart attack. About a week after his death, she  _  some of her insight with a classroom of students. As the late afternoon sunlight came streaming in  _  the classroom windows and the class was nearly over, she moved a few things aside on the  _  of her desk and sat down there. With a gentle look on her face, she paused and said,\"Before class is over, I would like to share with all of you a thought  _  I feel is very important. Each of us is put here on earth to learn, share, love, appreciate and give of ourselves...and  none  of us knows when this fantastic experience will end. It can be taken away at any moment. Perhaps this is a(an)  _  that we must make the most out of every single day.\" Her eyes beginning to  _  , she went on,\"So I would like you all to make me a  _  ...from now on, on your way to school, or on your way home, find something beautiful to notice. It doesn't have to be something you see---it  _  be a scent --perhaps of  _  baked bread wafting out of someone's house, or it could be the sound of the breeze slightly rustling the leaves in the trees, or the  _  the morning light catches one autumn leaf as it falls gently to the ground. Please, look for these things, and remember them. \"For,  _  it may sound silly to some people, these things are the 'stuff' of life. The little things we are put here on earth to enjoy. The things we often take for  _  . We must make  _  important to notice them, for at any time...it can all be taken away.\" The class was completely quiet. We all picked up our books and filed out of the room  _  .That afternoon, I noticed more things on my way home from school than I had that whole semester. Every once in a while, I think of that teacher and remember what a deep  _  she made on all us, and I try to appreciate all of those things that sometimes we all  _  . Take notice of something  _  you see on your lunch hour today. Go barefoot. Or walk on the beach at sunset. Stop off on the way home tonight to get a double dip ice cream cone.  _  as we get older, it is not the things we did that we often  _  , but the things we didn't do.",
