Later it was a fireman, policeman, lawyer ... As I grew older my dreams of the future   _  . When, at last, I was in college, I made up my   _   to become a preacher  as my father.   _   I studied and prepared for that life. I reached 45 _ in the end and I was preaching nearly fulltime for much of my adult life.\n However, for many, there is a \"thief\" which goes around stealing our   _  . Sometimes, the thief will come as a parent, a  , or a friend, but the   _   thief is, so many times, just   _  . \n   We find ourselves just about reaching the top, and this \"small\"   _   inside says, \"You will never make   _  .\" \"You can't possibly do this.\" And on and on the \"small\" voice   _   some kind of failure. Failure, though, is exactly how dreams are   _  . It is one of the most important tools we have, because it teaches us invaluable   _  . And, when we learn these lessons well, we are ready   _   success.\n   The message I always gave my children was that you   are able to  do anything your heart desires. Remember the saying, \"Nothing is   _  to a willing heart.\" There are   no  \"overnight\" successes, but with determination, it will come. Imagine yourself in the life you dream of   _  . Then in your heart, believe it   _  happen for you. Then work, work, work. You get the picture.\n   So, be true to your dream, and don't let anyone   _   it from you--especially yourself.",
