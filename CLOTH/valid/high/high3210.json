    "article": "It is a timeproven fact that smile is a language. It is a universal language   _   by the people of every nation, and the commonest way to show our   _   will perfectly without saying anything.\nOne day I was shopping in a small town in California. It was my misfortune to be   _   by a clerk who seemed most   _   and not at all concerned about my intended   _  . I bought nothing, and walked   _   out of the store. My anger   _   with each step. Outside, standing at the corner, was a young man in his early twenties. His expressive eyes met and held mine, and in the next instant a beautiful, amazing   _   covered his face. I gave in   _  . The power of that shining smile   _   away all my anger, and I found the muscles in my own face happily   _  . \"Beautiful day, isn't it?\" I said. Then, suddenly something inside me sent me turning  back. \"I really owe you a   _  ,\" I said softly. His smile deepened, but he made no   _   to answer. A Mexican woman nearby stepped   _   and said, \"Carlos can't speak English,\" she volunteered. \"Shall I tell him something?\" At that moment I felt changed. Carlos' smile had made a big person of me. \"Yes,\" my   _   was enthusiastic and sincere. \"Tell him 'Thank you!'\" \"Thank you?\" The woman seemed slightly   _  . \"Just tell him that,\" I insisted. \"Surely, he'll understand.\"\nWhat a smile! Although I have   _   seen that young man again, I'll never forget the   _   he taught me. From then on, I became smileconscious. I practice it   _  , anywhere and everywhere, with everybody. This action on my part would always draw a goodnatured smile   in return  .",
