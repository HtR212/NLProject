When she heard her daddy say to her  _  mother with whispered desperation , \"  Only  can save him now\", the little girl went to her bedroom and took out her piggy bank. She  _  all the change out on the floor and counted it carefully. Then she  _  her way six blocks to the local drugstore . \"And what do you want?\" asked the chemist. \"It's  _  my little brother,\" the girl answered back. \"He's really, really sick and I want to buy a  _  . His name is Andrew and he has something  _  growing inside his head and my daddy says only a miracle can save him.\" \"We don't  _  miracles here, child.I'm sorry,\" the chemist said, smiling  _  at the little girl. In the shop was a  well dressed  customer. He stooped down and asked the little girl, \"What kind of miracle does your brother  _  ?\" \"I don't know,\" she replied.\"He's really sick and mommy says he needs  an operation  . But my daddy can't pay for it, so I have brought my  _  .\" \"How much do you have?\" asked the man. \"One dollar and eleven cents,  _  I can try and get some more,\" she answered quietly. \"Well, what a coincidence ,\" smiled the man. \"A dollar and eleven cents -- the  _  price of a miracle for little brothers.  _  me to where you live. I want to see your brother and  _  your parents.\" That well dressed man was Dr Carlton Armstrong, a surgeon . The operation was completed without  _  and it wasn't long before Andrew was  _  again and doing well. The little girl was happy. She knew exactly how much the miracle cost ... one dollar and eleven cents ... plus the  _  of a little child.",
