I became very  _  because of this.\nBut a girl with dark skin and long shiny hair   _  me. Her best characteristics are her\nopenness and  _  . She is always smiling, like a\nbeautiful sunflower following the sun. Without  _  I\nenjoyed being with her and soon we became good friends. As time went by, I\ngradually became a  _  girl. But this joyful\nperiod didn't last long. We were admitted to different colleges. I felt like I\nhad gone  _  to my always-on-the-move childhood.\nI felt  _  and helpless and I was afraid that I\nwould  _  her as my best friend. She stayed calm\nand said to me: \"Rain, you can achieve more than I do, so  hold on  to your dreams and make a big effort! Real friendship doesn't fade\nand we will be best friends forever.\" Maybe she didn't realize what a great  _  she was to me at that time.\nHowever, it turned out that my   _  were well-founded. I felt that the  _  between\nus was getting bigger and bigger. One day, she sent me a text message happily\ntelling me that she had fallen in love with a handsome boy in her class.\nI felt happy for her, but at the same time I was secretly worried about our friendship. I   _  her\nseveral times intending to tell her to think carefully about her  _  with the boy, but I got no more messages from her. I felt sad that\nperhaps our friendship would not  _  . I had almost\ngiven up hope  _  she visited me at my campus a\nweek later. She looked  _  but was wearing the\nmost beautiful smile. She gave me a big hug and said: \"I'm sorry. I want to be\nmyself and your friend forever!\" We cried together,  _  the\npeople walking past. She told me her sad story, and we knew we had gone back to\nhow it was before.\nNow I firmly believe that distance and time can't   _  you from a friend. If you care enough\nabout each other, friendship never fades.",
