    "article": "When Dave was eighteen, he bought a secondhand car for 200 so that he could travel to and from work more  _  than by bus. It worked quite well for a few years, but then it got so old, and it was costing him  _  much in repairs that he decided that he had better  _  it. He asked among his friends to see if anyone was particularly  _  to buy a cheap car, but they all knew that it was falling to pieces, so  _  of them had any desire to buy it. Dave's friend Sam saw that he was  _  when they met one evening, and said, \"What's  _  , Dave?\" Dave told him, and Sam answered, \"Well, what about advertising it in the paper? You may  _  more for it that way than the cost of the advertisement!\" Thinking that Sam's  _  was sensible ,he put an advertisement in an evening paper, which read \"For sale: small car,  _  very little petrol, only two owners. Bargain at 50.\" For two days after the advertisement first appeared, there was no  _  .But then on Saturday evening he had an enquiry .A man rang up and said he would like to  _  him about the car. \"All right,\" Dave said, feeling happy. He asked the man whether ten o'clock the next morning would be  _  or not. \"Fine,\" the man said, \"and I'll  _  my wife. We intend to go for a ride in it to  _  it.\" The next morning, at a quarter to ten, Dave parked the car in the square outside his front door,  _  to wait there for the people who had  _  his advertisement. Even Dave had to  _  that the car really looked like a wreck .Then, soon after he had got the car as clean  _  it could be, a police car stopped just behind him and a policeman got out. He looked at Dave's car and then said, \"Have you reported this  _  to us yet, sir?\"?",
