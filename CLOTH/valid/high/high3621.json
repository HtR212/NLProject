    "article": "There once was a king in a faraway country. One day, he decided to   _   a prize to the artist who would paint the best picture of   _  . So many artists   _  . The king looked at all the pictures.   _   there were only two he really liked, and he had to   _  between them. \nOne picture was of a   _   lake. The lake was a perfect mirror with peaceful huge mountains all around it. Above was a   _  sky with light white clouds. All who   _  this picture thought that it was a perfect picture of peace.\nThe other picture had   _  , too. But these were not flat at all. Above was a (n)   _  sky, from which rain fell heavily and in which lightning played   _  . Down the side of the mountain was a waterfall with loud sound. This did not look   _   at all. \nBut when the king looked   _  , he saw behind the waterfall a tiny bush   _  in a crack in the rock. In the bush a mother bird had   _  her nest. There, with the current of angry water, the mother bird was   _   her hungry children in the nest, taking no attention to its   _   surroundings -- in perfect peace. \nWhich picture do you think   _  the prize? The king chose the second picture. Do you know why?\n\"Because,\" said the king. \"Peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no   _  , trouble or hard work. Peace means although you are surrounded by noisy things you   _     keep calm in the heart. That is the real meaning of peace.\"",
