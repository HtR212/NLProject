He   _   slept with his window open even when snow was falling outside.\nOne winter, he went to Finland on business. When he   _   his room in the hotel, he found that the windows were closed to   _   the icy air out. He did his best to open one but failed. The bed was really   _  , but Wilson couldn't sleep. He wasn't able to   _   the closed windows. No fresh air! It was   _   to think of.\nAt about one o'clock in the morning, he was   _   awake. Worrying about the air in the room, he became very angry. Where was the   _  ? He could see something that looked like   _   over there. He threw a shoe at it through the darkness with all the force of his strong right arm. A terrible sound of breaking glass   _   the room, but to Wilson's sad heart, it seemed like the sound of   _   music.\nWhen daylight came through the window, he   woke up   and lay with his eyes close. There was   _   to worry about.   _   was it? Oh, the broken window! Yes, indeed. He would have to pay   _   that. He opened his eyes to look. Suddenly he sat up in   _  . The window was not broken at all. The   _   was all in one piece, just as good as it had been the night before.   _   fresh air was entering the room through the window!\nHe then turned his eyes to the   _   and saw a broken picture   _   on the all. There was a shoe on the floor below it, and a lot of broken glasses around the shoe.",
