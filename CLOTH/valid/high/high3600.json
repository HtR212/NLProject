    "article": "The beginning of a Frank Sinatra song drifted across the dance floor and I knew my dad would call out and request that, which for most people is very  _  .\n              As he walked towards me to ask for the first  _  , I could see there were38 _ in his eyes .I grasped the side of my chair,  _  myself up with my arms ,and grabbed the two metal sticks which keep me  _  as I stood to take his hand.\n              It took all my will to  hold back  my own tears and inside a voice kept  _  : \"Don't fall over ,Martine.\" We grabbed each other and in some way shuffled out a dance for the whole of the song.\n              For my dad, it was a turning point. He had  _  his friends on his 70th birthday he would lead his daughter in the first dance,  _  he had done so many times before .Almost a year after the suicide bomb on the London Underground train which blew  _  both my legs above the knee ,I had managed to realize his  _  .Like so much that has happened over the last 12 months, there was something  _  about the moment.\n              Today, on July 1, as I face the first anniversary of the terrorist  _  , I am preparing to leave the country for a while. I know I  _  be celebrating the fact that I am alive,  _  I do not feel able to remain in London for the event.\n              Psychologically, I am a different person. I am very body conscious. When I go out I am  _  that children will make fun of me on my artificial legs. In my wheelchair I cover my lower half with a blanket  in case  what remains of my body draws  _  glances.\n              Despite my brave claims of what I would do when I left the hospital in March ,the reality is that I will  _  be able to do many things .I thought I would be able to wear my artificial legs all day ,to run ,to go out alone. But that is just not possible.\n              I keep asking myself,   _  does it become normal? Is this normal now?",
