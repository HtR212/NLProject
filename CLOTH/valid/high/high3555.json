I started my boxing  _  when I was 12. In high school I boasted that one day I was  _  to be the champion of the world. As part of my training, I would run down the street. I would rush in and out of shops to  _  them I was training for the Olympics and I was going to  _  a gold medal. I never thought of failing but only glory I was going to  _  when I won.
