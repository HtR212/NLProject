    "article": "On May 27, 1995, our life suddenly changed. It happened a few minutes past three,   _  my husband, Chris, fell from his horse as it  _  over a fence. Chris was paralyzed   from the chest down,  _  to breathe normally. As he was thrown from his horse, we entered into a life of  _  with lots of unexpected challenges . We went from the \"haves\" to the \"have-nots\". Or so we thought.\n  _  what we discovered later were all the gifts that came out of  _  difficulties. We came to learn that something  _  could happen in a disaster. All over the world people  cared for  Chris so much that letters and postcards poured in every day. By the end of the third week in a  _  center in Virginia, about 35,000 pieces of  _  had been received and sorted.\nAs  a family  we opened letter after letter. They gave us  _  and became a source of strength for us. We used them to  _  ourselves. I would go to the pile of letters marked with \"Funny\" if we needed a  _  , or to the \"Disabled\" box to find advice from people in wheelchairs or  _  in bed living happily and  _  .\nThese letters, we realized, had to be shared. And so  _  we offer one of them to you.\nDear Chris,\nMy husband and I were so sorry to hear of your   _  accident last week. No doubt your family and your friends are giving you the strength to face this  _  challenge. People everywhere are also giving you best wishes every day and we are among those who are keeping you  _  .\nYours Sincerely,\nNancy Reagan",
