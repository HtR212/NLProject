    "article": "If a teenager had some problems in her life years ago, she might go home and write them in her diary. Now, a teenager with the  _  problems might go onto the Internet and write about them in a blog. In many ways, a diary and a blog are very  _  . So, what makes blogging different from writing in a  _  diary?\nThe biggest difference is that blogging is much more  _  than a diary. Usually a teenager treats her diary like a book full of  _  that she doesn't want to  _  .\nIt's interesting that someone who writes in a blog  instead of  a diary will probably write nearly the same information. Both diaries and blogs tell details about what happened to the  _  that day.\nI have a little sister, and sometimes I go online to read her  _  . She writes about things like waking up early for swimming practice and not  _  enough for her chemistry test. When I was her  _  , I wrote about the same things, but  _  in my diary. Then, after I had finished writing, I would hide my diary in a secret place because I was  _  that my sister might read it!\nBecause blogging is such a public way of writing, it has both good and bad points. The biggest  _  with blogging is that anyone can read what you write. If I was angry with a friend during high school and wrote something  _  about her in my diary, she would  _  know.  _  , if my sister ever wrote something bad about a friend, that friend  _  read her blog and got angry.\nBecause we do not always  think about  things carefully before we write about our days, it is  _  to accidentally write something that hurts someone's feelings in a blog.",
