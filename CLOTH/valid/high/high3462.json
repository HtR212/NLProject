    "article": "Mom had lived in a nursing home for the past three and a half years, suffering the increasing effects of dementia . They were tough years, actually  _  for us family members than for her, I believe. She suffered very little  _  in those final years, less than she  _  when living in her own home. This was because other people took better care of her than she did herself. All dementia is not alike. Mom's form  _  her short-term memory more than her long-term memory. By the time she went to the nursing home, her short-term memory was  _  non-existent. We learned to  _  our conversations with her to old things of the past. Usually, she could connect with these  _  and seem to enjoy us  _  about them. I noticed in her last year that her long-term memory was  _  ., too. And it became ever more  _  to engage her. In her last six months, we had very little  _  of her responding, though a few times she  _  us. So, when we called her, we would just  _  to tell her about our lives, things we were doing, things our children and grandchildren were doing. The  _  would be short. We would tell her we loved her; she would either be  _  or make some grunting sounds.  _  I expected Mom's death, it was still bad news to hear. She is  _  . Even one-way conversations were more  _  than no conversations. So now, all we have are  _  and a few physical items that were hers or gifts from her. On Mother's Day this year we will send no  _  , no gift, make no call. But we will remember her.",
