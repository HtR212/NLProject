    "article": "The nine-year-old boy was attracted by the sight of my father practicing martial arts the moment he walked into the gym. As my father threw speedy punches into the  _  bag-yet was hardly able to move it-the boy walked slowly toward him. My father,  _  of the boy's stare, jammed a couple of sharp sidekicks into the bag to end his  _  . He picked up his towel, sat down on a nearby bench, and began  _  his face and hands. \"Hey, mister,\" said the boy. My father  looked up  at the boy, bringing the towel down off his face and putting it around to the back of his neck. \"Do you know or  _  ?\" the boy asked. \"Actually, I know ,\" my father answered. \"Cool. What  _  are you?\" \"Black belt,\" my father said. \"You like martial arts?\" \"Yeah, and I want to know if you can show me a  _  !\"said the kid. \"Can you show me how to  _  someone?\" My father  _  for a moment before he said, \"Come here.\" and  _  with his hand for the boy to come  _  . His expression was serious. The kid took a couple of steps closer to my father. Looking slightly  _  .As the boy moved closer, my father quickly  _  his hand straight out,  _  stopped within an inch of the boy's chest. The boy, shocked, jumped back in clumsy  _  , almost falling over himself. My father smiled, with his hand still outstretched in the boy's direction. \"Give me your  _  ,\" my father said. The boy inched forward again,  _  . My father took his hand and began to shake it  _  , as if the two of them had been old friends  _  each other. \"You know, kid,\" my father said, \"you'll solve more problems with this move than with any other.",
