I have never  _  that Teddy would give her life for me without the slightest  _  . I have always  _  our relationship by saying, \"We are completely bonded.\"  _  I have no idea  _  true this statement was until I was diagnosed with cancer.\nThrough the stages of my  _  from three operations, Teddy stayed near me, watching my every move. She was clearly anxious and upset when I felt  _  or distressed. I had been able to  get over  many of the difficulties so far---the loss of body parts, the side  _  of medication---but the thought of losing my long hair during chemo   made me  _  . Over a three-week period, handful of hair separated from my itchy scalp  . Each  _  brought me greater distress. One evening,I sat in a rocking chair, touching my  _  hair and crying sadly. Teddy lay on the floor beside me; suddenly she began to pull at the fur  on her tail.  _  I could stop her, she had ripped   out a few clumps .\nTeddy's  _  stopped my tears and self-pity. The next morning, I found Teddy sleeping in a mass of long black hair, no doubt with considerable pain. Her beautiful black  _  now looked like a funny little rat's tail. Then Teddy looked up at me with her devoted little face. It was  as if  she was willing me to feel better. I could almost hear her saying, \"If you have to lose your hair, I'm going to lose mine, too.\"\nTeddy and I both appeared a bit  _  that summer. In the fall, when her winter coat came in, Teddy's tail quickly began to look better. My hair 54 _  a bit longer to return, but I never  _  about it again. Sharing my loss with Teddy took the sadness away.",
