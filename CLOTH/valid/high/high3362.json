    "article": "I noticed the woman when I entered the newsroom. My secretary told me she wanted to put an ad to  _  a baby. So I suggested several  _  lines for these ads to her:  Wanted  , Baby to love; or Dear Birth Mother, Let Us Help You. The ad would contain  _  about her and her husband: they were  _  , could afford to raise a child. But then something  occurred to  me: the major newspapers carried ads like this and their  _  were larger than ours. \"Have you tried the major ones?\" I asked. \"Yes, but all failed and one more wouldn't  _  .\" She handed me a check and left with a  _  smile. A week later the woman called in a  _  of delight: \"Please don't run the ad again. We 've connected with  a birth mother  . The baby is due in a month.\" Good news. I asked her if she  _  keep in touch if the adoption  turned out  to have a happy ending. She agreed but added when the adoption was final she was  _  to give me the story. One day my phone rang. I  _  her voice immediately. \"The adoption is final. Would you like to come and meet him?\" Happily, I made a (an )  _  with her for the next day. \"His name is Ben,\" she said, as I started to take  _  . \"He slept through the night from the start. Now he's smiling and starting to turn over. Of course I'm not  _  him. If he is a little slow.\" She paused. \" Oh, I should tell you Ben has Down's Syndrome. \" I stopped writing . I wasn't sure how to  _  . But she smiled \"Ben was meant for us, don't you see? He needs me more than a  _  developing child would.\" She sat on the sofa, holding her son. Both of them smiled. \"You wanted a story with a happy ending,\" said the woman \" You got it.\"",
