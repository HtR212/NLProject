    "article": "Until I was 13, I assumed I was just like everyone else. But one day I read a piece of paper in my dad's briefcase that 21 _  everything. That's when I saw the words: \"Simone is said to have Asperger syndrome.\"\nI screamed at my dad, \"Tell me what it is!\" He 22 _  that I have a mild form of brain disorders, which was a problem that shapes the way I interact with other people. I wasn't sure exactly what he 23 _ , but it didn't matter. I just wanted to try to 24 _  my shock and go back to the way things were before I knew.\nBut even though I wouldn't 25 _  acknowledge the news, Asperger's still destroyed my confidence and made me 26 _  and isolated. I felt like an outcast  -- not just because Asperger's made it hard for me to make friends, but because now I had this 27 _ . I just wanted to be like everyone else. 28 _ , at 16, I said to myself, \"Enough! You can't run and hide from it, girl. Just face it.\"\nIt's funny, the first time I thought something was 29 _  was not because of what I couldn't do -- it was because of what I could do. In the sixth grade, while other kids were 30 _  with spelling, I was like a human spell-checker! I've also had a photographic memory, and 31 _  I call my \"super powers\" -- extrasensory hearing and acute awareness: I can 32 make out  phone numbers people dial just by the sound the buttons make when pressed or 33 _  hear one sour note in an entire symphony! And I can 34 _  pay attention to two things at once.\nDon't get me wrong. Asperger's can be very confusing. For years I felt like a butterfly 35 _  in its cocoon  , waiting to emerge. It took years of work with a psychologist to 36 get over  the difficulty of making friends.\nI'm not going to let Asperger's create 37 _  for me. That's why I am happy to have found out about and faced my 38 _ . Asperger's is a metaphor  for life: We all have 39 _ , but the key is to be able to have the 40 _  to face what's bad about them and still find what's good.",
