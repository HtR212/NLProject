    "article": "The trip to that city was eye-opening for everyone,and near its end,all the young people in our group began to reflect on what it had meant. We  looked back on  the first night we had arrived. We had all gone into the markets of the city  so that  the young people could experience its energy. But what we actually saw simpl  _  us all--the rundown houses,the children in rags,the people begging for money...Walking home,  _  under a low bridge,we came across  _  families of homeless people seeking a bit of dry ground to sleep on  _  the night. We had to step over bodies as we found our way through the darkness. The poverty was  _  than anything my young companions had ever imagined. Back in the hotel,an air of sadness settled over the group. Many  broke down  and cried. Spending time in this 9  _  moves a person to care about humanity. That evening,our group spent hours talking about what we had  _  .Gently,I encouraged everyone to talk about the difficult  _  that day's discoveries had inspired. Sitting together  _  a circle as everyone had a chance to speak,we all began to realize that  _  of us was alone in our struggle to cope with our reactions. Based on my  _  in poverty-stricken areas,I suggested that  _  the emotions we had were painful,they could also be important in helping us to move forward. We all  _  that we had seen things that should never be allowed to happen.  _  ,what could we do about it?Together,we began to brainstorm ways we could help to ease the  _  we had seen. As I encouraged group members to focus on  _  they could do,a sense of determination  _  the previous sadness. Instead of despair,these young people began to feel a call to action.",
