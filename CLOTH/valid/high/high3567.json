On the  _  was Marty Bandera, a literary agent to whom I had sent a draft of my novel three weeks earlier. \" I have a couple of  _  ,\" Bandera said. \"First, how old are you?\" \"I'm 48,\" I replied. \"Are you in good  _  ?\" \"Yes, excellent.

I suppose many people would have been  _  , but not me. Each time, I just  got down to  another one. My husband advised me to find something else to do, but I refused to  give up  . Seeing this book  _  was the best thing that has ever happened to me. It's a mystery story (like all the others) and it was on the best-seller  _  two weeks after publication!

I always had stories running through my  _  and as soon as I could write I  _  them down on paper.
