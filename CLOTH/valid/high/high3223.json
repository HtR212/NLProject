Students were curious but the professor without looking at them 23 picked up     a very large and empty jar.And then he started to 24 _  it with small rocks.  _   the jar appeared full, the professor asked his students whether the jar was full\nThe entire class 26 _  that jar was indeed full.Next, the professor picked up some 27 _  and began pouring them into the jar.The moment pouring was 28 _ , he shook the jar lightly.As a result of that, all the small rocks 29 rolled into  the open areas between the rocks comfortably.  \nProfessor again asked the students if the jar is full.Same 30 _  from the class like before.Professor 31 _  a bit but silently, and this time he picked up a box of sand.He poured the box into the jar and sand filled the entire 32 _  spaces.At the same time, professor 33 _  his question to the class, if the jar was full? Yes again. \nProfessor now 34 _  towards the class and said, this jar 35 _  your life.All the things in the jar I poured mean some important lessons.The rocks are the most important things, 36 _  is family, your partner, health and your 37 _  .Even if everything else in your life goes away but the rocks remains there, your life would still be full 38 _  the most important things are still present in your life.Pebbles represent other significant things like car, house and job etc.And the sand is the small stuff or everything else. \nIf your time and 39 _  is spent on small stuff then there is no 40 _  for the pebbles or the rocks or in other words, most important things of your life.",
