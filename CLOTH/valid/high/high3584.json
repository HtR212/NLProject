As the big day was coming, they grew upset because each of them had a problem they had never before   _   with each other.\nJack decided to   _   his father for advice. \"Father,\" he said. \"I am   _   concerned about the success of my   _  . I love Joan very much,   _   you see, I have very   _   feet, and I'm afraid that Joan will be put off by them.\"\n\"No problem,\"said Dad. \"All you have to do is to   _   your feet as often as possible, and always wear socks, even to   _  .\"Well, to him this seemed to be a solution  .\nJoan decided to take her   _   up with her mom. \"Mom,\" she said. \"when I   wake up   in the morning my breath is truly terrible.\" \"Honey,\"her mother comforted her. \"Everyone has bad   _   in the morning.\" \"No, you don't understand. My morning breath is so bad that I'm afraid Jack will not want to sleep in the same room with me.\"\nHer mother said simply, \"Try this. In the morning,   _   straight out of bed, and head for the bathroom and brush your teeth. The key is, not to   _   a word until you've brushed your teeth.\"\nThe loving couple were finally married. Not   _   the advice each had received, he with his socks and she with her morning   _  , they got on quite well. But six months   _  , the husband woke with a start to   _  that one of his socks had   come out  . So, he madly searched the bed. This woke his bride and without   _  , she immediately asked, \"What on earth are you doing?\"\n\"Oh, no!\" he cried. \"You've swallowed   my   _  !\"",
