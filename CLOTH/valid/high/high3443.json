    "article": "Anthony is 80 years old. He lives by himself in his own home. He spends most of his time in front of the TV  _  his favorite programs like, football, baseball, and car racing. I've  _  him for about six years and his  _  breaks my heart. Anthony reminds me of my own grandfather. Anthonhy is from the isalnd of Malta, a small island in the Mediterranean Sea. He came to the United States, like  _  of us, to look for a better future for his family. He  _  eight kids and they live in the United states but  _  of them live near him in Florida and nor do they visit him. I  _  him once a day to check on him and spend some  _  time with him. I even watch TV with him that I don't even  _  , but the  _  is that he feels someone is there  _  him company. When he gets sick, or does not feel  _  enough to cook, I will cross my fence and start  _  for him.  Once in a while  I will run some errands for him. When he has an appointment with his  _  , I will drive him too. I'll fix his remote control when it is not  _  , etc...If something breaks or stops working, he calls me because he knows he can  count on  me anytime. It is important to care about someone,  even if  it isn't your own family. You would be  _  of yourself when you do help someone. I am pretty sure there are many Anthonys out there facing the same loneliness. Please  _  a difference in someone's life.",
