Angry and   _  , Tony rushed to the park, when he suddenly saw a wasp  flying about among the rosebushes. It   _   him, making him get away from the roses immediately. Then, a   _   came into his head: How is it that something so much   _   than himself could frighten him like that?\nHaving   _   the insects for a while, he had a good understanding of the wasp's   _  : it was fear. A wasp could never 37 _  a person, but everyone was so afraid of its sting that they left the wasp   in peace  . So Tony spent that night   _   what his 'sting' could be. \nThe next day, Tony seemed like a   _   boy. No longer did he walk with his eyes fixed on the ground, nor did he   look away   nervously when people spoke to him. Instead, he became brave and   _  , ready to face up to anyone. The boy who stole his packed lunch that day ate so spicy a sausage sandwich that he   ended up   crying and coughing. Never again did he rob Tony of his lunches. Another older boy   _   to hit Tony, but this time Tony looked at the boy   _   and bravely. From memory, he told him the   _   of his parents, his teacher, and the boy's own mother, \"  _   you hit me I'll call them, and you'll be severely punished.\" The boy turned around and   _   from the scene.\nThe strategy   _  . So, in the end, Tony became like the wasp he'd seen. Without even having to sting anyone, he frightened them, and   _   that no one would mess with him.",
