On that day, after seeing the Capital Dancing Company performance, I  burst out  , \"Mama, when I grow up, I'm going to be one of those.\" As I grow older, my  _  in the world of dance  _  changed, but that little girl's dream of someday becoming a  _  in the company never left me. In 2005, aged 18, I received the phone making that dream come true: I became a member of the company. When I looked  _  on that day now, I believe I stayed in a state of  _  disbelief until I was asked to rehearsal . Though I was entirely excited with the offer, it did not come without  _  . Through the strict and hard rehearsal, I found it important to  _  myself to learning the skills fast with every bit of concentration . It is the extreme  _  to detail and stress on practice that help us  _  . Then comes a  _  show schedule of up to five performances a day, I found a new  _  of the words \"HARD WORK\". The practice pushed me forward than I thought  _  . I learnt to make each performance better than the last. Besides, the teachers not only teach us skills but help us a lot in daily life when we are  _  in trouble. Today, as a member and dance captain in the unbelievable company, I see a  _  that has encouraged not only  a number of  little girls but a wonderful company that  _  to develop and grow and encourage people every day to  _  their dreams.",
