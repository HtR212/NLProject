Dante Gabriel Rossetti, a famous 19th-century poet and artist, was once  _  by an elderly man. The old man had some sketches and drawings that he  _  Rossetti to look at and tell him if they were any good, or if they at least showed  _  talent. Rossetti looked them  _  carefully. After the first few, he knew that they were worthless, showing not the least  _  of artistic talent. But Rossetti was a  _  man, and he told the elderly man as gently as possible that the pictures were of little  _  and showed little talent. He was sorry, but he could not  _  to the man. The visitor was  _  , but seemed to expect Rossetti's  _  . He then apologized for  taking up  Rossetti's time, but would he just  look at  a few more drawings--these done by a(n)  _  art student? Rossetti looked over the  _  batch of sketches and immediately became enthusiastic over the talent they  _  . \"These,\" he said, \"oh, these are good. This young student has great talent. He should be given every  _  and encouragement in his career as an artist. He has a  _  future if he will work and stick to it.\" Rossetti could see that the old man was  _  moved. \"Who is this fine young artist?\" he asked. \"Your son?\" \"No.\" said the old man sadly. \"It was I who painted the pictures 40 years ago.  If only  I had heard your praise then! For you see, I got discouraged and  gave up  drawing--too soon.\"",
