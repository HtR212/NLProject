    "article": "I volunteered to work at my local Oxfam shop in North London in 2010 for nearly four months. It was a typical charity shop. I would go in a few times a week to work for a/an\n  _   of hours.\nMy responsibility as a volunteer for Green Initiatives in Shanghai has been very different. I   _   to China in September 2014 to work as a teacher in Kunshan, Jiangsu Province, a neighboring city of Shanghai. I also wanted to   _   my interest in the environmental sector.\nIn early September, I met Nick and Nitin, founders of Green Initiatives, at one of their events and, in   _   of my teaching background, they decided that I would be a good fit for their student outreach program, an environmental education-training program for high school students in Shanghai.\nI was given the   _   of creating their student modules and since then I have put together four higher-level student modules, which introduce key environmental issues \nsuch as food waste, recycling and sustainable consumption. I am also currently working   _   another two modules focused on energy conservation.\nIt involves a lot of research, and I usually end up   _   around 10 to 15 hours a week searching through science textbooks, online articles and government websites to find relevant and accurate   _  .\nI find the research   _   because I get to find out about what new   _   and technologies are being developed to deal with environmental problems.  _   to working in a shop, I find this job is quite rewarding, since I am   _   something that can not be obtained from books.\nI also   _   many of the Green Initiatives events. These events are one of the best things about volunteering because I get the   _   to network and meet \n  _   people who have ideas about   _   to make Shanghai 'greener.'\nWhen I am at the events, we often have Chinese speakers, and so the events have also been an interesting   _   experience for me.\nOne of the biggest differences between my experience   _   at Oxfam and Green Initiatives is the motivations of the people you meet and work with. At Oxfam, the motivations were varied. People were there to 'do their bit for charity,' to earn a living, or   _   because they could only afford the things we sold.\nSpeaking to people in China, motivations are also varied but the main driver is the environmental degradation, such as air pollution, which affects, or at least concerns, many of these people in their everyday lives.\nAs the student modules are coming to an end, I am looking forward to being involved in the upcoming projects in Shanghai, especially when the sun comes out and we can  _   more outdoor events.",
