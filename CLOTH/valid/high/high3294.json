    "article": "Geography is an important tool for learning and understanding history. Geography affects history--just look at  the changes in world geography over recent years. Governments change, and   _   countries were born.Many countries no longer have the same names they   _  even five years ago. Climate changes  bring about  events such as droughts  and floods that cause lots of loss of life and the movements of people from one place to another in search of  _  . Environmental changes can change the entire   _  of a community or region.\nAs with history, children have a natural interest in  _  . Watch a group of children playing in the sand. One child makes streets for his cars,   _   a second child builds houses along the  _  .A third scoops out a hole and  _   the dirt to make a hill, then pours water in the  _   to make a lake, using sticks for   _  . The children name the streets, and   _   may even use a watering can to make  _   that washes away a house. They may not realize it,   _  these children are learning some core features of geography--how people interact with the Earth, how climate   _  land, and how places   relate to  each other through the movement of things from one place to another. Turning to maps or globes, When we talk with our children about vacation plans, events  happening  around the world or historical events, we teach them a great deal about geography. Not only can such activities help our children learn how to use key reference tools,  _  over time, they help them form their own mental maps of the world, which allows children to better organize and  _  information about other people, places, times and  _  . Such activities also help our children learn to how to work together in the future.",
