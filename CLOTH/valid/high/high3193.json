    "article": "My friend John always has something to tell me. He knows so much that  _  men have to have older and more worldly wise men to tell them,  for instance  , who to trust, how to care for others and how to live life  _  the fullest. Recently, John lost his  _  Janet. For eight years she fought against cancer, but in the end her sickness had the last  _  . One day John took out a folded piece of  _  from his wallet. He had found it, so he told me, when he  _  up some drawers at home. It was a  _  love letter Janet had written. The note could look like a school girl's scrawls(,) about her dream guy.  _  the letter was written by a woman who had had seven children, a woman who fought for her life and who  _  only had a few months left to live. It was  _  ,) for how to keep a marriage together. Janet's  _  of her husband begins like this, \"Loved me. Took care of me. Worried about me.\" \"Helped me when I was ill.\" The next  _  reads. After that she turned  _  the paper and added \"Warmth. Humor. Kindness. Thoughtfulness.\" And then she writes about the husband she has  _  with and loved most in her life. \"  _  there when I needed you.\" The last words she wrote  sum up  all the others. I can see her for me when she added thoughtfully \"Good friend.\" I stand beside John now, and cannot pretend to know how it feels to lose someone who is as close to  _  as Janet was to him. I need to  hear  what he has to say much more than he needs to talk. \"John,\" I ask. \"How do you stick together with someone through 38 years--not to mention the sickness? How do I know  _  I can bear to stand by my wife's side if she becomes sick one day?\" \"You can.\" he says quietly, \" If you love her enough, you can.\"",
