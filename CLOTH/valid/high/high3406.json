    "article": "The Power of a Note\nOn my first job as sports editor for the Montpelier(Ohio) Leader Enterprise, I didn't get a lot of fan mail,  _  a letter that was dropped on my desk one morning seemed   _   to me.\nWhen I opened it, I read: \"A nice piece of writing on the Tigers. Please   keep up  the good work.\" It was   _   by Don Wolfe, the sports editor. Because I was a teenager (being paid for 15 cents a column inch ), his words couldn't have been more   _  . I kept the letter in my desk drawer  _  it got rag-eared. Whenever I  _  whether I had the ability to be a writer, I would reread Don's note and feel   _   again.\nLater, when I got to know him, I learned that Don made a  _   of writing a quick, encouraging word to people in   all walks of life  . \"When I made others feel good about   _   ,\" he told me, \"I feel good too.\"\nNot   _   , he had a body of friends as big as nearby Lake Erie. When he died last year at 75, the paper was   _   with calls and letters from people who had been recipients of his   _   words.\n  _  the years, I've tried to copy the example of Don and other friends  _  care enough to write uplifting comments, because I think they are on to something important. In a world too often cold and unresponsive, such  _  bring warmth and reassurance. We all need a push from time to time, and a few lines of  _  have been known to turn around a day, even a life.\nBe   _   with your praise. Superlatives like \"greatest\" \"smartest\" \"prettiest\" make us all feel good. Even if your praise is a little ahead of reality, remember that expectations are often the   _   of dreams fulfilled.",
