Gary is a fellow classmate of mine at college, and for him this is a major  _  . We know that Gary suffers from a  _  , which makes it almost impossible for him to  _  his movements. As a result, he will  _  his life in a wheelchair. He cannot write with a pen or a pencil, and speaks so slowly and strangely that it takes  _  to understand what he is saying. However, behind his  _  appearance, Gary is a warm, fun-loving, intelligent person. His disability affects his muscles, not his mind or  _  .

The main  _  why I admire him so much is that he is determined to lead a  _  life, in spite of his physical difficulties he has to overcome. Although his  _  prevents him from going to school, he gives himself an education by studying at home. Being unable to  _  himself, he uses a special typewriter to write letters to his friends and beautiful poems which  _  the true depth of his thoughts and character.
