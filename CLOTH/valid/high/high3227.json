    "article": "Rediscovery\nI used to be a happy child with a loving family and many friends. I had a  _  that could brighten a cold winter day and I had a special love for life.\nAt twelve, my life had a huge breakdown. It was then that I  _  OCD . I started to wash my hands ten times an hour, and I constantly  _  my kitchen oven to make sure that it was off. This way of life continued for four painful years, and by then, my OCD had led to depression . I was no longer the  _  little girl I had been.\nIn the tenth grade I finally  _  to my mother that I was suffering from depression along with my OCD. My mom took me to a doctor and I started taking  _  . Over a few months, the medicine did help the OCD, but I still was struggling with depression.\nOne autumn evening, I hit rock bottom. I thought suicide was the only  _  to my depression problem, so I decided to write a suicide note. As I was  _  it, my eyes fell on a photo. It was a   _   of an adorable little girl, wearing her red soccer uniform and holding a bike helmet. She had a bright smile that showed she was full of life.\nIt took me a few minutes to  _  who the girl in the photo was. The photo had been taken when I was seven years old. I almost couldn't believe that smiling child was me. I felt a chill go down my spine . It was like my younger self had sent me a  _  . Right then and there I knew I couldn't kill myself. Once I had been a strong little girl, and I had to become  _  like that again.\nI tore up my suicide note and  _  that I would not rely only on my medicine. I would have to fight the depression with my mind, too. I could make myself happy again.\nIt has been two years since I  _  myself. The real reason I am healed is that I took action and refused to let depression  _  my life. I learned a lifelong  _  : Never give up. Everyone has challenges in life, but everyone can  _  . I am living proof of that.\nNow I am prepared for whatever  _  life may bring. I have a role model to  _  up to for strength, and who is guiding me  _  life. My hero is a seven-year-old girl, smiling back at me from a photo on my desk.",
