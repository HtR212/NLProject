It is not possible!\"\nI was crushed to be so close to success and then to be blocked!  _  I walked away. All at once I stopped short. There must be another way. This stitch  did take special37 _ . But surely there must be other Armenian women in Paris who knew how to do it.\nI went back to Mrs. Vidian and 38 _ my plan. She really didn't think it would   _  , but she agreed to help.\nWe were like detectives, Mrs. Vidian and I. We put ourselves on the trail of any Armenians who lived in Paris. One friend led us to another.   _  we tracked down 20 women, each of whom could knit the special stitch. Two weeks later the sweaters were  _  . And the first shipment from the new house of Schiaparelli was on its way to the United States!\nFrom that day a steady stream of clothes and perfumes   _  from the house of Schiaparelli. I found the world of fashion gay and  _   , full of challenge and adventure. I shall never forget one showing which was really a  _   . Once again Father's advice helped me. I was busy getting ready to show my winter fashions. Then just 13 days   _  the presentation the sewing girls were called out on strike. I found myself left with one tailor and a woman who was     in charge of   the sewing room! I was as depressed as my models and salesgirls. \"We'll never make it,\" one of them cried.\nHere, I thought, is the test of all tests for Father's advice. Where is the way out this time? I wondered and   _   . I was certain we would have to  call off   the presentation or else show the clothes unfinished. Then it dawned on me. Why not show the clothes unfinished?\nWe worked hurriedly. And,   _  13 days later, right on time, the Schiaparelli showing   took place   . \nWhat a showing it was! Some coats had no sleeves; others had only one. Many of our clothes were still in a(an)   _  stage. They were only patterns made of heavy cotton cloth. But on these we pinned sketches and pieces of material. In this way we were able to show that what color1s and textures the clothes would have   _   they were finished. \nAll in all, the showing was   _  . It was so different that it was a great success. Our unusual showing  _  the attention of the public, and orders for the clothes poured in. \nFather's   _   words had guided me once again. There is more than one way to the square always.",
