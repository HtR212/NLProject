    "article": "I was late for the school bus and rushing to get ready. My dog, Tippy, got to the front door and lay down in front of it - his way of asking to be petted. I  _  his begging for affection , hurdled over him and ran for the waiting bus.  _  , that afternoon, when I came home, Mom said to me  _  , \"Honey, I have some  _  news that I need to tell you. This morning, while you were at school, Tippy was hit by a car and  _  . I'm so sorry.\" \"No! It's not true!\" I was  in shock  . I couldn't believe her. \"Tippy, come here! Come on, boy!\" I called and called for him. I waited. He didn't come. Feeling  _  , I wandered into the living room. I didn't cry that night. I still couldn't believe that he was  _  . When I got off the bus the next day, the  _  at home was deafening. Finally, my sobs bubbled up and erupted like lava from a volcano. I couldn't stop  _  . I hadn't even petted him when I left.  _  could I have known that was my last chance? I cried until I felt empty inside. Time passed, and against my will, I started to  _  some things. I realized what little control any of us have over what happens  _  a dog. We can do everything right, but  _  things can still happen. But good things can happen too. That's  _  . The best way to deal with the hard times is to  figure out  what you need to do to get through them when they come, and to remember that hard times always  _  . I now deeply understand the \"circle of life\". Everyone is born, everyone  _  , and that's the way it is. If dogs never died, there would be no  _  for others like Belle - my new dog. Best of all, I realized that Tippy  left behind  all of my good memories of him. And they come to me every time I call!",
