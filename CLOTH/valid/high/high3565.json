    "article": "Yesterday, after telling my brother, Rhys, and me to stop playing like wild animals, Mom went to take a bath. We were having a pillow fight when   _   one hit a vase. Mom   _   the loud crash. Wasting no time, she came 43 _  into the room. I was sure that she was going to shout at us, but instead she just knelt by the   _   and began to cry. \nThis made Rhys and me feel pretty 45 _ . We went over and put our arms around her, and she explained to us why she was so upset. In the pieces 46 _  a broken glass rose, one petal   gone, which was given by Dad on their first wedding anniversary. Dad had said that if he ever forgot to bring flowers home 47 _  an anniversary in the future, Mom was to look at that one. It was like their love--it would last a 48 _ . \nWe began crying, and 49 _  to glue it. But Mom said that wouldn't really fix it. 50 Now that  it had been broken, the 51 _  of the \"limited edition\" had reduced. As Mom 52 _  began to pick up the mess, we tried everything we could think of to 53 _  her up, but even our best funny faces didn't 54 _ . Tears kept coming down her cheeks. Everything was picked up. Seeing Mom going back to the bath, I 55 _   her and put both hands on her shoulders, saying, \"All things can be 56 _ , Mom. The only thing that cannot be broken is our 57 _ . It's the only thing that can never be broken. \"\nMom hugged me very tightly and 58 _  smiled. After dinner that night, Mom glued the petal back onto the rose. Then she softly said, \"My rose is truly unique. Its tiny damage reminds me of 59 _  more important:The realization that love 60 _   forever. \"",
