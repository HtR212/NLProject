All life's circumstances can be seen in an egg where in the soft yolk inside is our  _  and the hard shell outside is the barrier. When the barrier breaks from outside, our desire is crushed, but when it breaks from inside, we  _  a new skill, a new habit and a new life. I was 22 years old. I did not  _  where the kitchen was in my house, since I had  _  gone into the kitchen before. All of a sudden, I had to move to America to pursue my master's degree. That is when it  _  me that I had to learn to cook a proper meal in order to  _  . My desire to cook began to  take shape  , and the yolk began to stir. The first time I made  _  , it came out like white glue. Within a month of experimenting with different recipes, I  _  the art of making Chinese fried rice and north Indian curry. This breaking of the eggshell from  _  gave me yet another skill for life,  _  . Now that I look back, maybe my wife agreed to marry me for this  _  alone. It is easy to break an egg from outside, but it is  _  to break it from inside. What is even more difficult is to  _  you from outside and break the egg from inside. That is where the role of a teacher, a mentor or a coach comes in. As a father, I took it as my responsibility to  _  my son cycling and swimming. In this case, the yolk was the untapped potential of my son and the barrier was his fear of losing  _  . It took months of patience and coaching to help him  _  his fear. It was an uphill task to keep him motivated through failures.  _  , I was glad and relieved when he learned both these essential skills. The important lesson here is that the egg will be  _  no matter what. Success, when the egg breaks from inside, is more about what you overcome than what you achieve. Life always throws up  _  . I urge you all learn the instrument that you always wanted to play but have not played so far. As the saying goes, there is never a lock without a key, never a problem without a solution. Persist, believe in yourself and allow your yolk to break through to a new soul, a new you.",
