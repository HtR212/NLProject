    "article": "Predictions of many robots in industry have yet come true. For ten years or more, manufacturers of big robots have explained how their machines can make industry more competitive and productive. The maker for  _  robots is oversupplied now, and the driving force of the robotics revolution is  _  to be with the maker of machines that handle a few kilos at most.\n\"Heavy-robot manufacturers are in some difficulty  _  finding customers. They are offering big  _  just to get in the door. There has been a  _  growth everywhere in the numbers of robots, so we admit we are either deceiving  _  or that the market is slowly growing,\" said John Reekie, chairman of Colen Robotics. \"The following things must hap-pen  _  the robotics revolution to occur. We must achieve widespread robot literacy.  Even though  there has been a computer  _  program, there must be a robot literacy program.  _  ,some kind of artificial intelligence needs to be  _  \"\nColen makes educational robots and machine tools. It is small  _  with companies like ASEA or Fujitsu Fanuc. But Colen with others in departments in universities such as Surrey, Manchester, and Dur-ham possesses an advantage  _  the giants. The big companies sell very expensive  _  to businesses with expert knowledge in automation. The  _  companies make robots for teaching people, and now they have realized that there is a need for small,  _  robots that they can meet.\nThe little companies either bring their educational machines  on  an industrial standard or design from the start. One technique that they all adopt is to choose  _  components where possible. The major cost of making  _  their models is the electronics, which will fall in price. There is  _  scope for reductions in mechanical costs. The use of standard parts,which are easily replaced, should give these robots a mechanical life of something in the order of five years.",
