    "article": "A new study found that inner-city kids living in neighborhoods with more green space gained about 13% less weight over a two-year period than kids living among more concrete and fewer trees. Such  _  tell a powerful story. The obesity epidemic  began in the 1980s, and many people believe increased portion sizes and inactivity are to  _  , but that can't be everything. Fast foods and TVs have been  _  us for a long time. \"Most experts agree that the changes were  _  to something in the environment,\" says social epidemiologist Thomas Glass of The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That something could be a  _  of the green.\nThe new research,  _  in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, isn't the first to associate greenery with better health, but it does get us close  _  identifying what works and why. At its most straightforward, a green neighborhood  _  means more places for kids to play - which is  _  since time spent outdoors is one of the strongest correlates  of children's activity levels. But green space is good for the mind  _  : research by environmental psychologists has shown that it has cognitive   _  for children with attention-deficit disorder. In one study, just reading  _  in a green setting improved kids' symptoms.\n  _  to grassy areas has also been linked to  _  stress and a lower body mass index   among adults. And an  _  of 3,000 Tokyo residents associated walkable green spaces with greater longevity   among senior citizens.\nGlass cautions that most studies don't  _  prove a causal link between greenness and health, but they're nevertheless helping spur action. In September the U. S. House of Representatives  _  the delightfully named No Child Left Inside Act to encourage public initiatives aimed at exposing kids to the outdoors.\nFinding green space is not  _  easy, and you may have to work a bit to get your family a little grass and trees. If you live in a suburb or a city with good parks, take  _  of what's there. Your children in particular will love it - and their bodies and minds will be  _  to you.",
