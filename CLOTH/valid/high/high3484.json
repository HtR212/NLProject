    "article": "Soon Tommy's parents, who had recently separated , would arrive for a meeting on his failing schoolwork and  _  behavior. Neither parent knew that I had called up  the other  . Tommy, an only child, had  _  been happy, cooperative, and an excellent student. How could I make his father and mother  _  that his recent failing grades  stood for  a brokenhearted child's reaction to his respected parents' separation and possible  _  ? Tommy's mother came in and  _  one of the chairs I had placed near my desk. Then the father  _  and was obviously surprised to see his wife. They pointedly ignored each other. As I gave a detailed  _  of Tommy's behavior and schoolwork, I prayed for the  _  words to bring these two together to help them see what they were doing to their son.  _  somehow the words wouldn't come. I found a crumpled , tear-stained  _  stuffed in the back of Tommy's desk. Writing covered both sides, a single  _  scribbled over and over. Silently I smoothed it out and gave it to Tommy's mother. She read it and then without a word handed it to her husband. He  _  . Then his face softened. He studied the scribbled words for  what  seemed a future life. At last he folded the paper carefully and  reached for  his wife's outstretched hand. She wiped the tears from her  _  and smiled up at him. I also couldn't keep back tears, but  _  seemed to notice. In this way I used the words to  _  that family. On the sheet of yellow copy paper  _  with the painful outpouring of a small boy's troubled heart, it said. \"Dear Mother ... Dear Daddy ... I love you ... I love you ... I love you.\"",
