In  _  Mom and Dad take people driving in a dog sled, and it's super fun!\nWhen the dogs were born, I was so  _  .That's when I saw my favorite--little Jip. Every  _  I had, I put little Jip in my arms. I carried him around and played with him, not just because it's fun to  play with  dogs. Getting them used to human touch makes a  _  sled dog, Dad says.\nWhen Jip was eight weeks old, he got his first  _  .All he had to do was  move around  wearing a light leash to get used to the  _  of pulling something behind him.\nWhen he was ten weeks old, I started  _  Jip to come when he was called. It was  _  time to try out a harness around his body. The harness can be a little heavy,  _  we left it on for just a short time each day.\n  _  , I put Jip 's harness on him at mealtime. I  _  him to a heavy chair. And I placed his  _  just far enough away so that when he ate, he had to pull on the line.\nThe dogs  _  fast! When they were four months old, we tied old shoes to their harnesses.  _  wolves, sled dogs like to run after anything that's moving such as a rabbit. We started teaching the  _  \"On by!\" That means leave the rabbit alone! A sled dog must stay on the trail .\nJip won't be fully grown and ready to pull a heavy sled  _  he's almost two years old. But now that he's nine months old, he's  _  enough to go on short runs with the big dogs. Dad says that maybe next winter I can  _  in the sled when Jip goes on practice runs. I can't wait!",
