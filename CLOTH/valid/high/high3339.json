They were very soft and white, for she had done  _  but wash them in clear water.\nThe other girl crushed some flowers in her hands, and they  _  like perfume   . \"What beautiful hands I have!\" she said. Her hands smelled like flowers,  _  she'd never done anything but wash them with  _  every morning.\nAnother girl nearby didn't show her hands. She hid them in the  _  of her coat.\nAn old woman came down the road and  _  before the girls. The first two  showed off  their hands and asked her whose hands were more beautiful. She  _  her head at them and then asked to see the hands of the  _  girl.\n\"Oh, these hands are clean,  _  ,\" said the old woman,\"but they are hard from  _  .These hands have been helping the girl's mother and father dry the dishes, sweep the floor, water the garden,  _  for the baby, and show the little brother  _  to build blocks. These hands have been  _  making the house a happy home.\"  _  the old woman brought out a ring set    _  a diamond.\"Here, wear this ring, my child. You deserve the  _  for the most beautiful hands that are always the most  _  .\"",
