And I used to   _   she must have something to do with Walt Disney's Snow White,22 _  she had the same bright blue eyes, short dark hair, and fair skin.\n I don't   _   much about what I learned in her class. But my 24 _  once told me that we used to25 _ a lot. To read what I wrote, my mother asked me to  _  it back and she would find there were so many  _  without red corrections. But28 _  a star. And sometimes even a Good! It  _  my mother. One day when she met Mrs White, she asked her why she never  _   my mistakes, and why she never31 pointed out  spelling or grammatical mistakes. And Mrs White said, \"The children are just beginning to get   _  about using words and forming  _  .I don't want to make them less enthusiastic about  _  . Spelling and grammar can wait. \"\nI think that  _  Mrs White had used her red pen more, I  _  wouldn't be telling you about that now. I  look back  now and think she must have been a rather  _  teacher. I used to misspell \"beautiful\" a lot. Never could I quite remember that the \"e\" goes39 _ the \"a\", which made my teacher in high school upset. However, I could put the \"e\" and \"a\" into   _  right places in the end. And thanks to Mrs White, I could express what I meant even if I couldn't quite spell it out.",
