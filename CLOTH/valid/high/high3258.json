But like New York,where a party or dinner often  _  business with pleasure, a Washington party is a  _  part of the business of politics, the business of making  _  connections. Some Washington parties have a  _  aura about them, depending on who gives them and who is there, but most parties are open-house  _  in fact, with the hosts not knowing most of the  _  who are there. I went to a few of these parties  because  I wanted to see the inside of some of the Washington mansions I had  _  so much about. Almost every time during the evening some man would come close to talk with me  _  , we didn't know each other at all. Such a  _  exchange clearly proves \"a gathering of friends\"  according to  Washington party standards. You don't even need an  _  to attend many Washington parties. You just have to know about them. No Washington hostess would  _  her servants to ask you who you were. Most of the bigger parties, those with 300 or 400 guests,  are given  to impress somebody, and Washingtonians  are easily impressed  . Most members of the Congress ,for example,  come from  middle-class backgrounds in smaller communities  _  the country. They are dazzled by  _  . They are dazzled by big names. They are ready to help Washington  _  hostesses. They go along with them because they are good friends or they don't notice that they  are being used  or they don't care if they are.",
