    "article": "Recent years have seen many conflicts caused by square dancing. Since loud music  _   students preparing for the College Entrance Examination (or gaokao),  elder ly  citizens who practise the dance near a local middle school in Beijing   turned down  the music to the lowest possible volume.   In spite of  the controversy, however, it is difficult to demand a(n)   _  on square dancing in the weeks before the College Entrance Examination , says an article .\nTo some degree, it is necessary for senior citizens to sacrifice the  _  of square dancing despite being very   _   of it. Their sacrifice is seen as necessary also because the gaokao is an important   _  point in a student's life.\nBut if students preparing for the okao have the  _   to study in a peaceful environment, then senior citizens, too, have the right to practise the dance form of their   _  without disturbance. In the Beijing case   _  above, more than 300 senior citizens have set a good example by   moving to  a smaller square away from the middle school and turning down the volume of the music while practising the square dance.\nTherefore, the authorities, instead of forcing senior citizens to   _  practising square dancing in the weeks preceding the gaokao, should take measures to  _   that they do so in non-residential areas and, definitely, as far away from   _  as possible. The authorities, for instance, could   _  for buses to take senior citizens to and from places where they could practise the dance without disturbing anyone and get some   _   exercise and mental comfort.\n  _  , local communities could organize leisure activities that create little noise to provide senior citizens with some  _  . In short, senior citizens should not be forced to give up square dancing in the weeks preceding the gaokao,   _  they should be provided with alternatives to spend their time happily.",
