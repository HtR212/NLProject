    "article": "Our bachelor uncle who lived with us was a quiet, approachable man, much given to hunting and fishing. It was one of the great pleasures of our young life to   _   him on his trips.\nI remember my first fishing trip   as if   it were but yesterday. I have been happy many times in my life, but never more strongly than when I received that first fishing-pole from my uncle's hand, and started off with him   _   the woods and meadows. \nMy uncle, who knew by long   _   where were the best places of pickerel , considerately placed me at the most favorable point. I threw out my line   _   I had so often seen others, and waited   _   for a bite. Nothing came of it. \"Try again,\" said my uncle. \nSuddenly the bait  sank out of   _  . \"Now for it,\" I thought; \"here is a fish at last.\" I made a strong pull, and brought up some weeds. Again and again I   _   out my line with aching arms, and drew it back empty. I looked at my uncle appealingly. \"Try   once more  ,\" he said. \"We fishermen must have patience.\" www.ks5u.com\nSuddenly something pulled my line and   _   off with it into deep water. Jerking it up, I saw a fine pickerel 46 _  in the sun. \"Uncle!\" I cried, looking back in uncontrollable   _  , \"I've got a fish!\" \"Not yet,\" said my uncle. As he spoke there was a splash in the water; the   _   fish disappeared in the middle of the stream; my hook hung   _   from the line. I had lost my   _  . \n\"But remember, boy,\" he said, with his   _   smile, \"never boast  of catching a fish until it is on dry ground. I've seen older folks doing that in more ways than one, and so making   _   of themselves. It's no use boasting of anything until it's done, nor then either, for it   _   for itself.\" \nHow often since I have been   _   of the fish that I did not catch! When I hear people boasting of a work as yet undone, I call to mind that   _   and the wise caution of my uncle: \"Never boast of your fish before you catch it.\"",
