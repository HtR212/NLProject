    "article": "As an intern , I grew to understand that nursing home patients was a valuable part of my education -- not just from a  _  angle, but for what they could  _  me personally. Mr. Smith was my first introduction to the nursing home. His  _  , regrettably, can probably exist in countless hospitals across our nation. An acute illness had brought him to our nursing home years ago, and his family  _  him shortly before he left hospital. Helpless and unable to care for himself, he had no  _  except for nursing home care,  _  he lay until I met him when I was an intern. Mr. Smith was almost noncommunicative. After transferring to the nursing home, he slipped into a tense and  _  state, waiting for his life to  _  . All efforts to bring him back to the mainstream life were  in vain  . Nurses faithfully tended to his physical needs, while he  _  as a shell of flesh and bone, completely lacking in life. For three years, I saw him every week. Not once did I hear him speak a word. Not once could I  figure out  his innermost thoughts. On my last nursing home visit, an idea  _  me. I brought my  _  into Mr. Smith's room as part of a(n)  _  in \"pet treatment\". Something  _  occurred. All of a sudden, he sat up and started talking, telling me of the days when he was a boy and had a dog  _  to my own. He told me stories of adventures he and his dog had had. For the first time, I saw the soul  _  from what had been a living corpse . That experience taught me not to underestimate the ability of the  _  things in life to touch hearts when carefully-made medicine has failed, and never to forget that within even the weakest of human bodies lies a life that is precious indeed --  one  that needs to be  _  and honored, even if it can't speak for itself.",
