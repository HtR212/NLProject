Later, in a bar, when I opened the first pack, I found - to my   _   - the twenty cigarettes were there.\nI'm still at the bar, telephone in one   _   and the cigarettes in the other. I'm dialing Shubentsov, who told me to call the moment I felt the urge to   _  . I feel it, feel it even   _   than I felt Shubentsov's healing  energy. That's saying something, since Shubentsov is known around the world for   _   smokers of their nasty habit, using a   _   method. He sent his healing energy from his fingertips, he tells me - something he picked up from another man in Russia. \"I help you for free,\" he told me in his muddy accent. \"Just call me   _  .\"\nI went to see Shubentsov. I think it's time to   _   because I'm getting old, and I can't keep doing this to myself. But here's the real problem. I should quit, but like a lot of you   _   with the same habit, I really don't want to. \nSmoking has been very good to me. Cigarettes have never let me down, never abandoned me on   _  , desperate nights. Smoking   _  my head, helps me   _  . Smoking has started conversations, driven away annoying people. Smoking helps me celebrate victories, get over losses, comfort the comfortless. It also chases away the mosquitoes.\nI will   _  . Soon. My body and my mind are demanding that , daily. \nI claim to smoke for pleasure, but I realise that slowly I'm losing control of this close, special friend. I  _   that. I realise it's not just a \"habit\". I'm   _  . \nSo here I am, attempting to   give up   again, at Shubentsov's place. I've tried all the other quitting techniques   _  . Anytime the urge to smoke   _  , he said, just call him immediately and he'll help. The funny thing is, I realise that I'm not phoning him to stop me from lighting up. I'm phoning him so I can. If I call, I'll have done my part. Then I can smoke this cigarette. Besides, I know that at 9.30 on a Friday night, I'll get the answering machine. I do. \"The office is open from ten to four. Call me back then. This machine does not take messages.\"\nI put the phone down and I can honestly say I'm   _  . You see, it's not Shubentsov's fault or anyone else's fault that I'm still   _  . It's mine.\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm going to smoke this cigarette. Whether I'll really enjoy it, though, is another story.",
