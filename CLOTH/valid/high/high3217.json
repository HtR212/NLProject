But in fact, five minutes later, they have  _  it ever happened.\" The other day when I came across these words in an article, I didn't agree with the  _  . The author thinks the best thing to do in this kind of  _  is to pretend nothing has happened, and so avoid  _  trouble. I admit that we should keep  _  because \"Your tears will only remind others of what happened, while your  _  can let them forget it.\" But this is far from satisfactory. We should do  _  to make things better. I used to be a(n)  _  girl and not very good at maths. Our new maths teacher asked me a question and I still remember how I hung my head in  _  when I couldn't answer it. \"If you don't know the answer, just tell me.\" the teacher said, \"If you don't how can I know  _  you know the answer or not?\" All of my classmates burst into laughter. My face turned red but the teacher  _  me to go to the blackboard and  put down  what I knew. If I had  _  the words in the article, I would have given up. But I tried my best. And to everyone's  _  , I succeeded! The teacher smiled and said, \"Well done! I  _  you could do it!\" Since then, I have become active in maths as  _  as in other subjects. I used to think doing maths exercises was a waste of time. But now, I know  _  I do can make things better. Everyone is the  _  of his own fate. If we make mistakes, we should take on an active  _  . Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep , and you weep alone.",
