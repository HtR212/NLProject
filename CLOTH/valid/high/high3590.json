    "article": "Two years ago, Shirley, wife, mother and doctor, found herself worn out. She got up earlier, and went to bed later, just to meet everyday  _  , but lacked  _  for the things that mattered most. She and her husband, a lawyer, began searching for ways to  _  their lives. \"We had to decide what was really  _  ,\" says Shirley. They knew they wanted more time to  _  with their threeyearold son, to exercise and eat right, and to develop friendship. So the couple chose to live more simply, shopping with care for necessities and enjoying inexpensive  _  such as reading, cooking and going to the park. Then Shirley  _  her job and began working part time. She printed business cards that  _  \"At your service, buy  _  a little time\" and helped clients with personal tasks like shopping, paying bills and  _  parties. \"I still work hard, but being able to control my hours makes a  _  ,\" she says, \"I can spare time to take my son to the  _  or play basketball with him. My stress and headaches are  _  .\" Shirley and her husband are  a bit  alone in wanting to  settle down  and live a satisfying life. A survey found that 54 percent of parents say they have little time with their children, and 47 percent of married couples  _  that they lack time together.  _  does the time go? For most people,  _  and commuting take up most of the day. Simplifying means becoming  _  of the ways we use money, time and energy, and finding ways to make things easier. Then we have to gain  _  over life and have time for the pleasures.",
