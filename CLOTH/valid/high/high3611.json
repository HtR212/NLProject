I sent her a gift certificate for\"A letter a    _   for the next year!\" in her birthday card. It was a big   _  . I've never been much of a letter writer, but I should be able to find plenty of   _   , for I was living far from home. She'd love to hear what was going on in my life.\nShe got fifty-two   _   that first year. Some were long and filled with homesickness. Others were short and newsy. More than once what she   _   was just a funny card with a few short   _  . All of them showed her that I was thinking of her   _  .\nAs her next birthday drew near, she   _   for another letter gift certificate for her birthday. For nine and a half years I   _   to her. So much happened in those nine years! At first I wrote about the cold Michigan winters and working on my graduate degree. Then I wrote about my own   _  . We lived in four different places during those years and I   _   them all.\nMy   _   letter arrived the day after her death. I've always wanted relationships with no  _  , and I felt I had given her the best   _   I could. Months later, while   _   through her things, my dad found a box filled with letters from me. Those letters were a(n)   _   of my life. Some were filled with moments and pictures I had completely   _  . She saved those memories for me in my letters.\nLife really does fly by. Loved ones come and go. But sometimes our gifts to others come back to us in   _   ways.",
