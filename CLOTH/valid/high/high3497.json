    "article": "I was working in a store three years ago. I remember one girl who started  _  there a few months after me. I remember always meeting her. I don't know  _  but for a strange reason we would never talk. We would just see each other and smile. She would  _  smile in a really happy way until one day when we got to work in the  _  department again. She  _  as if she was the happiest girl in the world. But I had a strange feeling. So I went up to her and said, \"What's wrong with you?\" She answered, \"Why?\" I said, \"I could feel you're very  _  today and you're trying to hide it.\" She was shocked as if I had  _  her deepest secret, so we started  _  . She told me why she was feeling like that and why she was  _  to hide it and we had a good time together. Time  went by  and we became good friends. She'd always tell me I had changed her  _  in so many ways, but I could not  _  how it had happened. I would just smile, not understanding what she  _  by that. Today this girl is one of my best  _  . I really don't know what I would do  _  her. She has been there for me in every possible way a friend could be. I guess what I'm trying to say is you  _  know when you're helping yourself. I  _  this girl never knowing that at the same time I was helping myself by finding a(n)  _  friend. So the next time you see a  _  , and he looks as if he needs  _  who will listen to him, listen to what he has to say. You never know, you might just end up helping yourself.",
