We had a great applicant pool this year. ...We can't offer spaces to  everyone  ... and place you on our waiting list.\" \"What does it say, honey?\" my dad asked, his voice full of  _  for me. \"I didn't get in, but I'm on the waiting list.\" \"Well, at least it isn't  _  ,\" he said brightly. \"Yeah, but  _  , I don't want to be on the waiting list; I want to be  _  . No one gets in off the waiting list. It's a way of saying 'Thanks for  _  '.\" \"Then let's go out there and tell them so.\" \"That sounds  _  , dad.\" I said sadly, \"It doesn't work.\" Upset and annoyed, I  _  myself in my room.

I just wanted to tell you how much going here would  _  to me--it is my only dream college-- and that I would use my time here to the best  _  . I wanted to let you know that if you gave me a chance and reconsidered my application, you wouldn't  _  it.\" The words had poured out  _  I could stop them or check their desperate tone. Mr. Soto looked me over for a minute before he smiled broadly. \"OK, that is the kind of thing we love to hear. Congratulations, you're in.\" It was so  _  and I asked, \"I'm sorry?\" \"We want people in the class who want to be here, who will  _  the best of this education. I'm glad you came to talk  _  to me. I'm happy to offer you a position in the Class of 2009.\" The whole experience taught me a lesson: if you truly want something, never, ever  give up  .",
