    "article": "On one of those perfectly sunny grandma-babysitting days, we set off to play in a nearby park. Kids were  _  the merry-go-round  and the swings. But what  _  my four-year-old grandson was the tennis court .\nTwo kids were riding their bikes in and out of the lines on the newly finished  _  . Their parents sat on a bench just inside the gated entrance. The kids laughed as they  _  one another.\nA sign was clearly posted on the entrance--No  _  Allowed.\nJust beginning his reading lesson, my grandson  _  knew the word \"No\". He asked me what  _  came next. I told him that the  _  asked people not to ride bikes on the tennis court. He was just four years old,  _  he could clearly see two kids riding their  bikes where they shouldn't be  _  .\nWe watched for a little while and then he reached up to  _  the gate. I thought that he wanted to watch the kids more clearly.  _  , he walked straight over to the couple and asked if they  _   what the sign said. Oh, what a  _  four-year-old!\nThe man gave me an unfriendly look and then said  _  that it didn't matter.\nI led my grandson away from the tennis court and told him that sometimes people don't like  _  rules.\nBy now, those kids are probably in middle school. What they  _  on that tennis court could be impacting  their lives today. I wonder whether those parents will  _  if their kids think that some rules don't matter.  How about  speed limits when they drive, or cheating on a test? Sometimes it's the  _  things that matter the most.",
