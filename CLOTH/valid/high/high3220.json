    "article": "Albert was an excellent painter. He had a happy family. One night, his oldest son developed a severe stomachache. Thinking it was only some   _   intestinal disorder, neither Albert nor his wife   _   the condition very seriously. But the disease was   _   acute diseaseand the boy died suddenly that night.\n  _   the death could have been   _   if he had only realized the seriousness of the situation, Albert's emotional health ameliorated under the enormous burden of his   _  . To make matters worse, his wife left him a short time later,   _   him alone with his six-year-old younger son. The hurt and pain of the two situations were   more than   Albert could handle, and he turned to alcohol to help him cope.   In time  , Albert became an alcoholic.\nAs the alcoholism   _  , Albert began to lose everything he   _   -his home, his land, his art objects, everything. Eventually Albert died alone in a San Francisco motel room.\nWhen I heard of Albert' s death, I reacted with the same disdain the world shows for one who   _   his life with nothing material to show for it.\nAs time went by, I began to reevaluate my earlier harsh judgment. I knew Albert's now adult son, Ernie. He is one of the kindest, most caring men I have ever known. I watched Ernie with his children and saw the free flow of love between them. I knew that kindness and caring came from   _  .\nI hadn't heard Ernie talk much about his father. It is so hard to   _   an alcoholic. One day I worked up my   _   to ask him. \"I'm really puzzled by something,\" I said. \"I know your father was basically the only one to   _   you. What on earth did he do that you became such a special person?\"\nErnie sat quietly and   _   for a few moments. Then he said, \"From my earliest memories as a child until I left home at 18, Albert came into my room every night, gave me a kiss and said, 'I love son.\nTears came to my eyes as I realized what a fool I had been to   _   Albert as a failure. He had not left any   _   possessions behind. But he had been a kind loving father, and he left   _   one of the finest, most giving men I have ever known..",
