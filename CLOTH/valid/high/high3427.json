    "article": "Cathy and I met a few days after I first arrived in China. I was walking around the English academy which had   _   me, introducing myself to my new colleagues, most of whom were Chinese. I entered Cathy's   _  , saw her, and immediately felt some   _   and happy emotions. She   _   so kind, yet professional. I couldn't stop smiling like a (n)   _  . After introducing ourselves and exchanging   _   questions, I asked whether she knew anyone who could   _   me in Chinese. She said she could, and   _   to meet after work.\nWe sometimes exchanged non-romantic texts in the evening. After a couple   _   , I invited her to my apartment. I was very nervous. Later, I asked if she would consider   _   me. She didn't immediately   _  , but said she would tell me the next day. I found it very difficult to   _  , but wait I did.\nThis was a   _   difference. In American culture, starting to date someone is not a bit important   _   , but I think in Chinese culture it is. Well, she said \"yes\", and so we spent lots of time together, and   fell in   love. I asked her to   _   me about 6 or 7 months later.\nWe had a Chinese style   _   in Cathy's hometown. My parents came, and it was great. It went really   _  . Everyone was very   _  . It was a very fun and interesting   _   for me, very different from a Western style wedding.",
