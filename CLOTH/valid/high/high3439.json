    "article": "I used to walk my dog every morning. Later when we got back home, I would give it some food. This usually caught the   _  of a mynah bird . The most   _  feature  of this bird was its brightly-coloured   _  mouth, so I found it a bit strange. Ks5u\n  Later I read a book and found that the colour yellow   stands for  \"communication, optimism  and inspiration \". I took the \"c\" from   _  , \"o\" from optimism, and \"in\"\nfrom inspiration to form the word \"Coin\". This became the bird's  _  .\n  Every time when my dog finished his   _  , Coin would look at me and sing , \"Raack! Raack!\" After singing, she would\nstart picking up the food left by the dog.\n   When winter came, Coin   _  . It was the longest winter that we had ever had. When spring  _  came, it was the time for the birds to fly back and I often  _    \nwhat had happened to Coin.\n   One day after I had given my   _  its food , a mynah flew down. It was then that I heard the  _  \"Raack! Raack!\" Coin was back! Sometimes, I wondered how Coin knew to\ncome back to the same  _  she had left.\n   Each morning Coin would come with her sweet   _  . Both I and my dog accepted\nher as a member of our family. Now, I understand that if we have optimism and\ninspiration in our life, and if we communicate often with others, we are sure to\nbe  _  by everyone.",
