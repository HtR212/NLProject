    "article": "There is a post office near our house. Recently, my mother asked me to mail some letters at the post office and  _  some stamps for her. Without giving it a(n)  _  , I took the letters and went to the post office. I brought home the  _  she wanted.\nA few days later, she mentioned that one of the letters I had mailed was39 _ a stamp, and asked me if I had put a stamp on it. She had  remembered  asking me to put a stamp on it,   _  I certainly had not heard her. So,  _  , it looked like the letter, which was a bill, would be sent back  _  , \"Return to Sender for Insufficient Postage\".\nA few days  went by  , and I returned to the post office again. While I was there, I saw the postmaster and happened to tell him about Mum's letter45 _ a stamp. I asked him to be on the lookout for its   coming back  .\n\"You know, \" he said, \"after you dropped the mail off, I   _  that it was a bill for a credit card company. I thought to  _  that you have always helped us during our times of need, and I wanted to return the  _  . So, to prevent you from getting charged with a(n)  _  fee from the credit card company, I took some money from our change dish -  _  pennies for folks who may need one -purchased a stamp for you, and put it on the letter.\"\nWhen I heard this, I couldn't  _  it. What a blessing that was! I  _  him over and over again for putting the stamp on the letter for us. Then I dumped all the  _  out of my purse and into the change dish in order to help others in the future.\nWhen I got home, I was able to tell Mum the  _  news. I think this was kindness karma   in action.",
