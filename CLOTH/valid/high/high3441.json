When we grow up, she made us  _  that our life is going to be what we make it, making sure we were  _  for our decisions and the person we would become.\nShe would say,\"It's your life  _  social comments. \"Then,\"What you want and what you get are sometimes two  _  different things. \" And then, \"No one ever  _  life was fain \" And she would  _  these comments together in such a way that you could never win. a(n)  _  ,but the result was that you realized your life is going to be what you make it.  _  I might go to my mom and say,\"I d like to play  footbalL \" And she'd say, \"Well,it's your life; if you want to go out there,you might get  _  and break your knees around the rest of your life,that's  _  .\" Then I  would say,44Well, you know  _  that won't happen. Actually I  _  fast on the  football field.\" And she would reply, \"Well,we don't  _  have the money. \" And then I would  _  .\" Yes,but that'not fain\nAnd she would reply, \"Well,life  isn't fair. \" Then me: \"But I'd really like to. \" And her: \"Yes,but what you want and what you get are sometimes two entirely different things. \"\nIt was this  _  of these three comments that allowed my mother to  _  us down the right path with her  _  but let us feel as if we were making the decisions  _  our own. The sum  _  of that advice was,in the end,you're responsible  for the life you lead That's the best  _  I've ever gotten.",
