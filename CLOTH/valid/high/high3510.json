    "article": "When I come across a good essay in reading newspapers, I tend to cut and keep it. But just as I am about to do so I find the article on the  _  side is as much interesting as the one.\nIt may be a discussion of the way to  _  in good health, or  _  about how to behave and conduct oneself in society. If I cut the front essay, the opposite one is likely to  _  damage, leaving out half of it  _  keeping the text without the subject. As a result, the scissors would stay  _  they start, or halfway done when I  find out  the regretful consequence.\nSometimes two things are to be done at the same time,  _  deserving your attention, you can only take up one of them, the other has to wait or be  given up  . But you know the future is unpredictable--the changed situation may not allow you to do what is  _  behind. Thus your are caught in a fix  and feel sad. How come that nice opportunities and brilliant  _  should gather around all at once? It may happen that your life changes dramatically on your preference of one alternative to the other.\nIn fact that is what  _  is like: we are often  _  with the two opposite aspects of a thing which are both  _  like newspaper cutting. It often  _  that our attention is drawn to one thing only after we are engaged in another. The   _  may be more important than the latter. I still remember a philosopher's words: \"When one door shuts, another  _  in life.\" So a casual or passive  _  may not be a bad one.\nWhatever we do in our liftime, wherever life's storm tosses   us , there  _  be something we can achieve, some shore we can land, that opens up new visas to us. Don't forget God always keeps an alternative  _  open for every one. While the front door is closed, there must be another open for you.",
