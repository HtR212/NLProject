    "article": "A farewell party was going on. Sylvia Calver hated being the center of any pubic show where she didn't know anyone. It made her  _  hot and she always felt she wanted to go away somewhere. But on an occasion like this when she knew  _  , there was no  _  to feel shy.  _  she had made up her mind to  _  people's attention for once in her life. Unlike others, Sylvia didn't have any sad feelings herself at leaving Palmeira Court Hotel or saying goodbye to its  _  -- she had left so many other  _  , and known too many people in her life to get upset by such things now. Yet this  _  was a particular occasion, and she hadn't had so many of those in her  _  . She had put on her  _  black dress and her long earrings. She had wanted to enjoy being the center of  _  for one evening, but now they had  _  old Miss Hutton of all people to give the  _  speech, whom she disliked. Even so, she thought there was no sense in getting  _  about it, for it was the first rule her  _  had given her -- avoid all anxiety, take things easy. So, surprising herself by enjoying her own well-rounded white arm as  _  showed through the sleeve of her  _  dress, she took a taste of her drink and then sat back comfortably with her cigarette. And her doctor's orders worked! For  _  out slowly, she put Miss Hutton off the end of her  _  with a cloud of tobacco smoke, so that she smiled to herself at the old girl's funny expression. She  _  herself quite well that night, even to her own surprise.",
