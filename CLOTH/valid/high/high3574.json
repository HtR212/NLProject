    "article": "Before I spoke to his school, Matt was waiting for me. He sat in his wheelchair   _   to move. As soon as he saw me, he started   _  . He could not talk,   _   his laugh melted the hearts of everyone walking by.\nOne of the teachers told me he was actually very smart. He just lost   _   of his muscles due to a childhood disease. He was   _   and very popular at his school -- his parents' love and encouragement made all the difference.   On the contrary  , at a book signing session, I met a girl   _  the name of Anne. She walked up with her mom with a   _   smile. Anne asked about my book with difficulty in her speech 9 _  a slight head-injury. I told her about it and she smiled the whole time and asked me to   _   one for her. I did.\nFive minutes later, I heard a voice from Anne's father, \"You know you will not understand the book. You can't   _   well.\" He said it so   _   that people were staring in their direction. Her confidence was  ly   _   and her bright smile was now replaced with a   _   of total disappointment. He   _   the book from her, brought it back to me and asked me to take it back. I asked him if he would allow me to buy the book for Anne. He said no with a   _  response.\nI thought back to Matt. He could not speak, walk, or play but was actually very happy and   _  doing well in school because of the love and   _   of his parents. Anne, on the other hand, had a slight   _   problem and may never know happiness or success because of a cold-hearted father. The truth is that whatever you are telling your   _   makes the difference between their success and failure in life.",
