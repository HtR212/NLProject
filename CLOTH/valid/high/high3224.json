Julie, our oldest child, came in. She'd been married for three months. I was still trying to get used to her   _   elsewhere. Sometimes I even set her place at the table without   _  . Julie handed me a small group of daffodils  and said, \"Guess what!\"   _   she opened the box on the table and bent to see what was inside. As I put the flowers in   _  , I answered happily, \"What?\"\nShe began telling me some small   _   of her new life as she made herself a sandwich. She'd learned to make cake by herself, and her boss was   _   of her because of her hard work. We sat at the kitchen table, and I   _   her eat, listening to her every word   _  . It was a   _   visit. Julie had to go to work. I thanked her for her flowers and for her visit; then I walked to the door with her and   _   as she drove out of the yard.\n  _   in the kitchen I sat and looked at the flowers. My daughter's   _   was as bright and dear as the   _   spring daffodils. Suddenly, I   picked up   the phone and dialed  my own mother's number. She lived a hundred mile away. When she   _  , I said, \"Guess what!\"\n\"What?\" she answered hopefully. Like Julie I didn't have any   _   news, just little details of the day and the children.   _   I'd come to understand in the last hour how valuable small talk could be. Just before I hung   _  , my mother said ,''You made my day.''",
