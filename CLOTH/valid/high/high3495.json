    "article": "In 2000 a report was published about what the earth might be like 20 years from then on. The report was a result of a three-year  _  . According to the report, the picture of the earth in the year 2020 is not a  _  one. The world will be more  _  because the population will continue to grow. The population could be  as large as  6 900 million, almost 2 450 million more than in 1995. More people would move into cities, especially cities in  _  countries. Cities like Cairo and Jakarta probably would  _  have 15 million by then. Food production will  _  , but not enough to feed all the people. Farmers will grow 90% more food than they did in 1995,  _  most of the increase would be in countries that  _  produce enough food for their people. Little increase is  _  in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Poor farming ways are  _  large areas of crop land, changing farms into deserts. More farmland is  _  as cities become larger and more houses are built.  Air pollution  will get worse as industrial countries burn more coal and oil. Many of the world's  _  could disappear as more and more trees are cut down. Energy will continue to be a serious problem. The experts say their picture of the earth for the year 2020  may be wrong  . They only carried out the situation that  _  today. By changing the situation, by  settling  the problems, the picture can be changed. There is  still  time for the nations of the world to work  _  a plan of action. But they warned that  _  too long to make decisions would greatly reduce the chances of success.",
