    "article": "For my daughter's 19th birthday, we bought her tickets to go and see Linkin Park, as they were playing in our city. We didn't really have the  _  but we knew how much this band meant to her. The night before she was like a  _  at Christmas. Every so often she got up and came to  _  with us, because she couldn't  _  . On the night of the  _  it was good to see her so  _  and excited, as she and her boyfriend set off. Needless to say when they  _  after midnight, with Tshirts and lots of pictures of the band,  listening to  her telling about how fantastic they had been, we knew the money had been well  _  . This will be a memory she would  _  forget, and nor would we.  _  full of excitement from the night before, the following day they  _  to go shopping on the other side of the city. My husband and I  _  , loving the fact that she had not  _  that quality as she grew up. Later that day they returned, with faces full of happiness and warmth. They presented my husband and me with a  _  each. On each present were the words \"Because you are the  _  mum/dad in the world\". When we said our thankyous and told her she didn't have to, we asked her  _  she had bought us gifts. Her  _  was simply \"Just because I love you\". This wasn't something  _  from our daughter; she had always given us a gift when she wanted to express her  _  , and each gift was always a welcome surprise. It could have been anything, it wouldn't have mattered, and it was the act itself and the feelings behind it.",
