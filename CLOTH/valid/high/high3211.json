    "article": "In the winter vocation of 2008, I was fixed with a job. I worked as a(n)  _  at Mr Breen's fruit shop. The fruit shop did good business. Most of the trade came from the housewives who lived in the neighborhood,  _  he also had regular customers who arrived outside the shop in cars. Mr Breen  _  them all by names and they sometimes even had their order already made up, always  _  me to carry it out to their car. They were clearly longstanding customers, and I  _  they must have stayed faithful to him because he had promised to sell good quality fruits. He had a way with them---- I had to  _  that. He called every woman \"madam\" for a start,  _  those who clearly were not, but when he said it, it did not sound like flattery . It just sounded  _  in an old-fashioned way. He was a great chatter  as well  If he did not know them, he would greet them with a few  _  about the weather,  but if  he did, he would ask about their families or make  _  , always cutting his cloth  according to  his customers. Whatever their bills came to, he  _  gave them back the few odd pence , and I was sure they thought he was very generous. But I thought he was the opposite. He never threw anything away. He was always looking for  _  for nothing.",
