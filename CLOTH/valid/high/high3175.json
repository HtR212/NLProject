When Germany was broadcasting a radio program to get international  _  , American officials believed they should  _  the German broadcast with words that they thought were the facts of world events. The first VOA news report began with words in  _  . \"The  _  may be good or bad, but we shall tell you the truth.\" Within a week, other VOA  _  were broadcasting in Italian, French and English. After the World WarIIended in 1945, some Americans felt VOA's  _  had to be changed,  considering  the Soviet Union became enemy of America.They wanted to  _  Soviet listeners. Then VOA began broadcasting in Russian. In the early years VOA began adding something new to its broadcast that was  _  \" Music USA\". Another new idea came along in 1959.VOA knew that many listeners did not know  _  English to completely understand its  _  English broadcast. So VOA  _  a simpler kind of English,  _  uses about 1,500 words and is spoken  _  of course, it is special English. In the  _  of most VOA listeners, the most  _  program is the news report. News from around the world  _  into the VOA news rooms in Washington 24 hours a day. It comes from VOA reporters in  _  cities and also from other  _  like BBC.VOA writers and editors use these materials to  _  news reports, which are being broadcast in 43 languages.",
