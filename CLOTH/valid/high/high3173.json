    "article": "When I was a law professor, a student reported that I made an error in grading his exam by giving him too many points. He was  _  and after thanking him for his honesty, I changed the  _  in my records. His beaming face turned to  _  \"You're lowering my grade?\" he said angrily. \"I would never have come in  _  ......\" He didn't finish the  _  but it was obvious that his display of honesty was false. He thought he'd have it all--praise and the  _  grade. Several colleagues thought I should have let the higher grade stand  _  all I'd accomplished was to discourage him from being  _  in the future. And every time I tell this  _  , some people agree with this remark. But I can't see how I could give good  _  for worsening my mistake in grading by undermining the honesty of all my grades by failing to  _  an error. The grade itself would be a dishonest reflection of his  _  and it would have been  _  to other students. How could I possibly give a  _  a gift of an unearned grade? I know voluntarily reporting an error in one's favor is  _  , but, like  _  extra change, it's the  _  thing to do. People with real honesty, hate to give up benefits as mush as anyone else. The difference is that for them a good conscience and reputation is reward enough to give reason for the cost of doing the right thing. Perhaps  lowering  the student's grade did discourage him from being honest in the future, but bribing him to be honest so that he does the right thing when it's cost-free would have  _  him even more. The duty to be honest is  _  right and wrong, not risks and rewards.",
