One afternoon, they were playing in the vacant lot down by the corner. Young Paul, who is only five years old, found the perfect place to  _  . His sister, Natalie, had  _  her eyes and was counting to ten when Paul noticed the mail box at the corner and that the metal door was standing open. The mailman had just  taken out  several bags of mail and had carried them to his truck which was standing a few feet away. Paul climbed  into  the mail box and pulled the door closed so hard that it  locked  . Soon realizing what he had done, he became  _  and started crying. At that time, Natalie was looking for him everywhere but could not find him. It was  lucky  that she happened to stand at the corner for a minute and heard her brother's cries. She  _  ran to tell the mailman who hurried back from his  truck  to unlock the metal door. Paul was now  _  , but he had such a bad fright that he could not stop crying. The mailman, however, soon found a way of making him  laugh  again. He told him that the next time he wanted to hide in a mail box, he should remember to put a stamp on himself!",
