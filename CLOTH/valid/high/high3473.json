The bus stopped and we got on.\n  _   in eastern countries, only eight passengers were permitted to travel   _  . I\nwas walking inside the bus  _  the conductor\ncalled, \"Only eight standing passengers! The last one who got on, please get\noff\". I thought it was me who had to get off.  _  , I\nsaw the elderly lady was about to get off. I told her to stay and got off\ninstead, but not until I moved past her did I realize she was  _  ! Her companion was her guide dog!\nAfter work I   _  the return journey. What a coincidence! The lady and her dog were\nthere! I was really  _  as I would get a chance to\nspeak with her. I started the  _  and she immediately  _  my Asian accent! She asked if I was the  _  person\nwho helped her that morning.  _  !\nOur journey started, and so did her   _  . She told me that her husband had fought in\nthe Second World War, during which a bomb  took away  his\nleft leg and that 10% of the government jobs were  _  for\ndisabled people and  _  was given to the spouses of war veterans  . Because of this they were   _  with her salary and his pension.\nTime flew and we arrived at our destination. I helped her cross the road to where an elderly gentleman with a(n )  _    leg was waiting for her. \nIt really   _  me\nto see how the three of them, helping each other, walked into the distance. But\nbefore we  _  I offered to be there every day to help her get\non the bus. Her husband was very grateful to me as it was a real  _  for\nhim to walk that far. How good it feels to be needed by others!",
