    "article": "A man, whose ability to walk was threatened after a car accident in his teens, completed a 200-mile cycle across Baffin Island in the Arctic. It took him eight days to complete the  _  . This man was Ben Rockett, aged 26 and from Taunton, England.\nHe battled   _   temperatures of minus 27degC and winds up to 100 knots to raise more than $1,000 for the charity Action for Children. Ben had to cycle in   _   conditions, but was helped with a(n)   _   designed bike. He spent months   _   for the challenge with David Hempleman-Adams, who was the first person to reach the geographic and magnetic North and South Poles.\nBen said, \"I've always loved to cycle in   _   places and this was an amazing experience. When I first arrived, it was nearly minus 30degC, but the wind was the most   _   thing ---it was extremely strong and made   _   on the bike extremely difficult.\" He   _  , \" Any part of the skin that wasn't covered ran the   _   of getting frostbite . I had to cycle with my face covered and I wasn't able to   _  any clothing for more than a minute at the most. I   _   had to keep changing the distribution of weight on my bike to stop it from   _   into the deep snow!\" Despite the great risk involved, he remained optimistic about his surroundings saying, \"The   _   was breathtaking and impressive. My   _   part was cycling on top of a river that was frozen   _  , it was so clear that it was like hovering  above the ground!\"\nBen decided to   take on   his Arctic adventure after completing a PhD at the University of Bath, where he studied the 53 _  of long-term foster care placements   on children and carers. It was then that he knew about the   _   of Action for Children, and wanted to   _   money and raise awareness about the charity.",
