    "article": "Comparisons were drawn between the development of television in the 20th century and the diffusion of printing in the 15th and 16th centuries. Yet much had happened  _  . As was discussed before, it was not  _  the 19th century that the newspaper became the dominant pre-electronic  _  , following in the wake of the pamphlet and the book and in the  _  of the periodical. It was during the same time that the communications revolution  _  up, beginning with transport, the railway, and leading  _  through the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and motion pictures  _  the 20th-century world of the motor car and the air plane. Not everyone sees that process in a right way. Nevertheless, it is  _  to do so. It is generally recognized,  _  , that the introduction of the computer in the early 20th century,  _  by the invention of the integrated circuit during the 1960s, radically changed the process,  _  its impact on the media was not immediately  _  . As time went by, computers became smaller and more powerful, and they became \"personal\" too, as well as institutional, with display becoming  _  and storage capacity  _  . They were thought of, like people,  in terms of  generations, with the distance between generations much  _  . It was within the computer age that the term \"information society\" began to be widely used to describe the  _  within which we now live. The communications revolution has  _  both work and leisure and how we think and feel both about place and time, but there have been  _  views about its economic, political, social and cultural implications. \"Benefits\" have been weighed  _  \"harmful\" outcomes. And generalizations have proved difficult.",
