The father  _  son, \"What is that?\" The son replied, \"It is a crow.\"  _  few minutes, the father asked his son a second time, \"What is that?\" The son said \"I just  _  you that it's a crow.\" After a little  _  , the father again asked his son, \"What is that?\" That time a(n)  _  tone could be heard in the son's  _  . \"It's a crow, a crow!\" A little later, the father went to his room and  came back  with an old diary which he had  _  for many years. After opening the right page, he asked his son to  _  it. When the son read it, tears came to his eyes.\" Today my  _  was sitting with me on the sofa.When a crow was  _  by the window, my son asked me 23 times what it was, and I  _  to him all 23 times that it was a crow. I hugged him  _  each time he asked me the same question. I did not feel  _  answering the same question.\" If your  _  become old, don't treat them or look  _  them as a burden . Instead be warm and  _  to them. From today on say this to yourself, \"I want to  _  my parents happy forever, for they have  _  for me ever since I was born, and they have always showed their  _  love to me.\"",
