    "article": "A few weeks after my first wife, Georgia, was called to heaven, I was cooking dinner for my son and myself. For a  _  , I had decided on frozen peas. As I was cutting open the bag, it  _  from my hand and crashed to the floor. The peas, like marbles,  _  everywhere. I tried to use a broom,  _  with each swipe they just rolled across the kitchen. For the next week, every time I was in the  kitchen  , I found a pea---in a corner, or behind a table leg. They kept  turning up  . Eight months later I pulled out the refrigerator to clean behind it, and  _  12 frozen peas hidden underneath. At the time I found those few remaining  _  , I was in a new relationship with a wonderful  _  I'd met in a support group. After we married, I was reminded  _  those peas under the refrigerator, and realized that my  _  had been like that bag of frozen peas. It had shattered . My wife had died; I was in a new city with a busy job, and with a son having trouble  adjusting to  his new surroundings and the  _  of his mother. I was a bag of spilled frozen peas; my life had come apart and scattered. When life gets you  _  , when everything you know comes apart, and when you think you'll never  make it  , remember that it's just a bag of scattered frozen peas. The peas can be  _  , and life will move on. You'll find all the peas  _  , including the ones that are hardest to find. And when you've got them  _  you'll start to feel whole again. The life you know can break apart at any time. But you'll have to  move on  , and how fast you collect your peas depends on you. Will you keep scattering them around with a broom,  _  will you pick them up one by one and put your life back together?",
