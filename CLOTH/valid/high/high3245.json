    "article": "Captian Blanchard stood up from the bench and studied the moving crowd. The day he was finally to return from Europe, they had    _   their first meeting here. He had requested a    _   of Miss Maynell, but she refused. \" You'll recognize me,\" she wrote in her letter, \"by the red   _   I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 pm he was in the Grand Central Station in New York   looking for   the girl whose heart he loved,   _   whose face he'd never seen.\nA pretty girl was coming toward him. She was so   _   that he immediately wanted to greet her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not   _   a rose on her green suit.\nJust then he saw Miss Maynell, a fat woman well past 40, with graying hair tucked under a worn hat. The girl in green was walking quickly   _  . He suddenly felt as though he was split   _   two, so   _   was his desire to follow her, and yet so deep was his longing for the woman whose spirit had truly   _   him for the past thirteen months.\nThat would not be love, but something   _  , something perhaps even better than love. It would be a friendship for which he had been and must ever be   _  . Without hesitation, he saluted  and   held out   the book that had brought them together, even though when he introduced himself and invited her to dinner he felt   _   by disappointment.\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know   _   this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the yong lady in the green suit who just   went by  , she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said   _   you were to ask me out to dinner, I should tell you that she is waitng for you in the big restaurant across   _  . She said it was   _   kind of test!\"",
