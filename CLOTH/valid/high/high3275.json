The weather was still very windy, but much less cloudy and it had stopped raining. I could see the hillside below us.\nI woke up my brother and we   _   our things and set off down the   _  . At first it was very   _   to climb down over the rocks. There were also thick bushes and it was hard to walk through them. At one stage (a part of journey) my brother stopped and   _   off his pack. He took out a T-shirt and a knife and cut an arm off the T-shirt. \"What on earth are you doing?\" I shouted. \"Watch!\" he replied, as he   _   the piece of material to a branch of a tree. \"We need to find our way   _   to the cave.\" I looked around and realized what a good idea this was. There were hills all around us and one   _   looked very much like another.\nWe went on climbing down the hill and finally came to a small river which passed through a wood. It was easy now to   _   the river through the trees. We walked on probably for about an hour.   In the end   we came to a small farmhouse. Smoke was coming from the chimney and we knocked hard on the door.   _  , there was no answer. A path led to the farmhouse so we decided to follow this. We walked along the path for about twenty minutes and   _   to a narrow road. We stopped and wondered. \"Which way now?\"   _   we were thinking, a small van came round the corner. We waved and the driver   _  .    \n\"Where do you want to go?\"\n\"We don't know.\" We told her where we lived.\n\"We were walking on the hills, and rain came down and we got   _  .\" \"Jump in, I'll take you to the next village and you can   _   your parents from there.\"\nThe following   _   was wonderful! Both of us were sitting in the baker's van, which was full of hot   _   with the most delicious smell. \"Hungry?\" said the driver. We nodded, and she pulled out a long thin loaf and   _   it to us. We were on our way home.",
