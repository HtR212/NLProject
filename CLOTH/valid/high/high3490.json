    "article": "It was a Christmas break from school almost 40 years ago. I had spent most of the morning like any boy would,  _  outside in the snow and enjoying the sunlight on the  _  day of the year. I liked stepping through the snow, making snowballs to  throw at  the trees, and watching the smoky breath float out of my  _  . After a while, though, the  _  got to be too much and I went  _  . It was warm in the house. I  took off  my wet coat and put on my favorite blue sweater. Then I walked into the  _  . My mom and grandma had just  _  baking two loaves of Italian bread. Mom looked up, smiled at me and asked me what I wanted for  _  . I smiled back and pointed to the delicious bread. Mom laughed,  _  a slice off the bread, and buttered it for me. Then she told me to go sit  _  the stove in the living room. Taking my slice with me I sat in my favorite chair, and felt the gentle heat from the stove  _  my little body. It was a moment of pure  _  . I felt so good and so loved that I  _  it to this day. Our daily  _  and love are all we need in this life. They are all we need to  _  . Anything else is just an extra blessing to be used to make this world a  _  place for us all. Be thankful for the daily bread that fills your  _  and for daily love that fills your soul. Then go out and with great joy  _  your bread, your blessings, and your love with the world.",
