    "article": "Every Wednesday,I go to Cantata Adult Life Services,a local retirement community,with my classmates to do community service. Our visits last about an hour, playing board games and cards with the residents  _  we're there. You can watch all the movies and TV shows you want about\"life back then\",but nothing  _  with talking to the people who were actually there.Just hearing their stories has  _  me in a way never thought possible. Whether it was talking to 98-year-old\"Hurricane Hilda\"about her glory days  _  a roller skater or chatting with Lou about the times she danced with a famous actor, I was completely impressed by every single  _  the residents wanted to share with me. Even the residents who don't have  _  memories make the experience fulfilling.I remember visiting Mrs.Robinson.She couldn't  _  much about her past,but she told me she'd  _  forget how kind I was just to listen to her\"rambling \". It made the realize that it's the  _  things that make life worth living.That's something I won't  _  anytime. If there's one thing I've realized in my three years of visiting Cantata,it's that  _  -just being there-means more than anything to many of the residents.And despite how  _  our lives are, there's always time to make them happy. For me,it feels great to be a  _  of happiness,a smile on a bad day or a(n)  _  for old memories.And at the end of the day,that's all that  _  . It's easy to feel like you don't have much in common with the  _  -especially,when you're a(n)  _  .But that's not true at a11. I hate to make much comment here,but age really is just a(n)  _  .As young adults,it's important for us to realize this sooner  rather than  later.We can learn a lot from the elderly, and they can often  _  from teenagers,too.",
