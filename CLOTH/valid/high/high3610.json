He  kept on  riding and riding, whipping the horse to go as fast as possible. Even when he was  _  or tired, he did not stop  _  he wanted to cover as much area as possible. When he at last covered a large amount of land, he was exhausted and was  _  . Then he asked himself, \"Why did I3  _  myself so hard to cover so much land area? Now I am dying and I only  _  a very small area to  _  myself.\" The above story is  _  to the journey of our  _  .
