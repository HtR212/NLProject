    "article": "After six months of living in New Zealand, I realized one thing. Despite my  _  for greater contact with local students,  _  I initiated the contact, it wouldn't happen. Local students are not interested in contacts with the international students, because they regard us as shy,  _  and sometimes snobby people. Of course we know that's not true. I want to change their opinions. After  _  the problem, I put on my \"confidence mask\" each morning and walked around with a smile on my face. I chatted with people whenever I had the chance. I showed that I was not afraid to  open up to  them, and that I was worthy of being a friend. A side-effect of my  _  confidence was that my emotions occasionally broke down Only in the  _  of my room, where no one could see, would I reveal my real emotions. All the rejections, funny looks, and  _  behind my back calling me a weirdo melted into tears. Once that was done, I would put on my confidence mask once again and start a new day. It finally worked My name became known throughout the school as I appeared to be  _  and active. Slowly, I discovered that I no longer needed to put on my confidence mask. I had real  _  friends. Instead of dragging myself to school and  _  to be happy, I was truly happy. I could not believe it when I was elected to the student government as Deputy Head boy----the first international student to receive the title. From my  _  dreams.",
