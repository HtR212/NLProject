    "article": "My first memories of acts of kindness are from when I was about 12 years old. From then on I always  help out  at home and with friends. That winter I notice that many  _  people had difficulty getting to the  _  store after a snowstorm. So I started to spend part of a  _  Saturday knocking at apartment doors to ask if any one needed  _  from the store. The grocery store was down a huge hill and I would bring  _  a couple of bags of groceries for them. I liked it and it made them so  _  . It started with  _  alone and then the number grew. A short time later, my  _  in the building asked what I was doing and a couple of them  joined in  and it became a routine. I  _  asked for or took money for it. Sometimes the ladies  _  slip the change in my pocket. I would just buy something the next time to give to them,  _  flowers or a card. I did this every  _  up to when I left to go to college. When I was away at  _  , many people asked my mom how I was doing. Through those conversations she  _  what I used to do ---I had never told her. Now, I'm a teacher and teaching my students the art of true  _  ; Everyone in the world needs help, and everyone can also  _  help. The image of those old people's happiness caused by my  _  of goodwill appears in my mind every time I have the chance to do something  _  . This is the power of charity.",
