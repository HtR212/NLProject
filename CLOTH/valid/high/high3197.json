More unfortunately, she  suffered from  cerebral palsy and had serious movement problems, which made her  drop out of  senior high school.\nHaving been writing poems for 16 years unknowably, she attained  _  overnight, almost suddenly. In 2014, Yu and her poetry were  _  widely across the Chinese websites and social media, attracting the attention of people from all walks of life. Her poetry collection Staggering in Secular World has been published and well received, with 15,000 copies  _  within the first day. Another collection Moonlight Falls on the Left Hand has been vastly promoted in Beijing and is expected to be  _  on February 6, 2015. Even film companies have come to visit Yu, hoping to  _  her story into a film.\nMany media have  _  her and her poems but their perspective have been somewhat  _  . Some media have  _  her poems and called her \"China's Emily Dickinson\", saying they carry real feeling and the power to move hearts.  _  others seem to focus more on her physical and social  _  to attract readers, and describe her as \"a farmer poetess with cerebral palsy\".\nWithout the media's offensive, Yu Xiuhua and her works would have  _  unknown to ordinary readers. The reports about her  _  disability and straggle have moved and even  _  many people.\nIn fact, Yu rekindles people's passion for poetry. But perhaps even more  _  than her poetry itself is the rural woman's  _  that fame is never something she hopes for. Such sudden and widespread personal-life  _  to the public has made Yu feel uneasy and even a little bit overwhelmed. All she hopes to do is stay at her home to create poems  _  just as she used to.",
