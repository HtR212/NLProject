One day Mr. Ingram found an old truck that was  _  in the soft, sandy soil of our field. It was full of melons that someone had tried to  _  from our farm before his truck got caught in the mud. Mr. Ingram explained that the truck's owner would be  _  soon, and he wanted me to watch and learn. It wasn't long  _  a local guy with a terrible reputation for fighting and stealing showed up with his two fully-grown sons. They looked really  _  . Calmly Mr. Ingram said, \"Well, I see you want to  _  some watermelons from us.\" There was a long  _  before the man answered, \"Yeah, I guess so. What are you  _  for them?\" \"Twenty-five cents each.\" \"Well, I suppose that would be  _  enough if you help me get my truck out of here,\" the man said. It turned out to be our biggest sale of the summer, and an awful, perhaps violent incident had been  _  . After they left, Mr. Ingram smiled and said to me, \"Son, if you don't forgive your  _  , you're going to run out of friends.\"",
