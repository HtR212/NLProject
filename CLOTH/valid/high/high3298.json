One Sunday after church the pastor  _  me to stay in his daughter's room because she was studying abroad for one year. To be honest, I really didn't want to stay with the pastor's family.  _  then he old me how much rent would be--a very  _  figure that included one home-cooked meal a day. I thought about it and  _  to move in. At the end of the term I had planned to make  _  living arrangements, since the daughter was to  _  home. But they suggested I  _  a room with their son. By this time I seemed to have been adopted into their  _  -- her people became my people. I  _  accepted the offer. As I emptied the daughter's bedroom, I thought it might be  _  to have a little sister. But when I later met her, I  _  that this idea of looking after her might be more interesting than I first  _  . We finally fell in love, married, and have been  looking after  one another for many years. There have been times that life turned out to be  more challenging  than either of us could have known. But we have always been able to go  _  largely because we knew that somebody deeply cared. It isn't about marriage--it's about  _  .

I'll try to look after you and  _  I will need you to look after me.\" Is there somebody you can  depend on  ? And is someone counting on you? We travel the path of life best when there is someone to look after, and when someone is looking after us.",
