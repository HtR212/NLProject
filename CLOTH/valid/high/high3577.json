    "article": "It was years ago. He was young. I saw him as he   _  the busy crossroads\nnear a mall in northwest Austin. He walked with one arm moving wildly,  _  a leg, as he went. I had seen the walk before at the\nhospital. He caught my  _  because I had known a\nyoung man who had  gone through  the ordeal   just a few years before and walked with a   _  walk.\nThe reason why I stopped to watch was that I didn't think he would   _  it\nacross the busy 7 lanes of  traffic  during the time\nallowed by the light. But as the light turned  _  and\nthe crosswalk light image flashed green for \"walk\", he  _  off\nat a fast pace.\nI found myself   _  my breath as the crosswalk light image  _  yellow\nand then changed to the \"do not walk\" image. A few seconds later, just a moment\nor two before the light changed and the traffic began to  _  again, he grabbed   a light pole to catch his breath,  _  on the other side. I realized that he had done this before\nand had the timing down  _  . He was tired, but he was\nwalking and living on his own.\nSometimes, the real heroes  _  . Flying on wings like eagles and running without growing  _  make great posters. But here, bending over  resting against  the\nstoplight pole was someone who  _  -- despite\ngreat hardships and difficulties -- to give up. He just kept walking.\nI don't know where you are when you face your own personal challenges. I don't know what   _  you are facing right now. I know some face the same challenges that\nhave caused others to admit  _  . And so, my prayer is\nthat you will just keep walking! Sometimes, the real heroes just keep walking.",
