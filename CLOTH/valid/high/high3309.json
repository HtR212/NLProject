In the United States, businesses and labor unions  _  \"fair trade\" laws to construct what economist Joseph Stiglitz calls \"barriers to imports.\" These so called \"anti-dumping \" laws allow a company that  _  a foreign one of selling a product below cost to request that the government charge special taxes to protect it from \"unfair\"  _  . Such dark protectionist thoughts are far from the  _  of the organizers of the United Kingdom's annual \"Fairtrade Fortnight\". Their  _  aim is to raise the price paid to developing-country farmers for their  _  by cutting out the inflated profits of the middlemen on whom they  _  for getting their goods to distant markets. Fair-trade products  _  cocoa, coffee, tea, and bananas do not compete with domestic European production, and  _  do not have a protectionist motive . This is how it works: In  _  for being paid a guaranteed price and meeting \"agreed labor and environmental standards\" (minimum wages, no farm chemicals ), poor-country farming cooperatives receive a FAIRTRADE mark for their products, given  _  by the FAIRTRADE Labeling Organization. This mark  _  supermarkets and other businesses to sell the products at a higher than  _  price . Third-world farmers get their income increased ,  _  first-world consumers get to feel virtuous: a marriage made in heaven. The fair-trade movement,  _  in the 1980's, has been growing rapidly. In a significant breakthrough in 1997, the British House of Commons  _  to serve only fair-trade coffee. By the end of 2007, more than 600 producers' organizations,  _  1.4 million farmers in 58 countries, were selling fair-trade products. Today, a quarter of all bananas in UK supermarkets are sold under a FAIRTRADE mark. But FAIRTRADE-labeled products still represent a very  _  share - typically less than 1% - of global sales of cocoa, tea, coffee, etc.",
