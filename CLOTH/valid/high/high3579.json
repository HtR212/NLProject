When you enter a supermarket, the manager knows  _  than you do how you will behave -- which  _  you will walk, where you will  _  , what will make you  _  one product rather than another. When customers go into a shop, they  _  look to their left  _  move towards the right. So supermarket entrances are usually on the left of the building, and the arrangement is to take shoppers  _  the store ,aisle after aisle, from left to right. Then shoppers will pay attention to all the  _  . Fresh fruit and  _  are displayed near supermarket entrances. This gives the  _  that only healthy food is sold in the shop.  _  foods that everyone buys, like sugar and tea are put near each other. They are kept in different aisles so customers are taken past other attractive foods  _  they find what they want. In this way, shoppers are  _  to buy products that they do not really  _  . People walk quickly through  _  aisles, but they move more slowly in wide aisles and give more attention to the products. One best-selling  _  for products is at the end of aisles, because shoppers  slow down  to turn into the next aisles. Sweets are often placed at children's  _  level at the checkout. While parents are waiting to pay, children  reach for  the sweets and put them in the trolley. Customers buy more when shelves are  _  than when they are half empty because they feel there is something wrong with those products that are there.",
