The pit was very deep and it looked as if there was no way  _  , so they started yelling at the two frogs to  give up  . \"The pit is too deep. You will die,\" they said together. When the  _  frogs kept trying, the crowd yelled  _  . After a while, one of the frogs believed what the others were saying, and fell down and  _  . But  _  , the second frog kept jumping hard  _  the negative remarks of those that kept yelling at her to accept the  _  and just die. Finally, with one big leap, she  _  it out of the pit! In fact, the second frog was  _  and unable to hear what the others had been saying. She thought they had been  _  her on the entire time they were yelling! What she had  _  considered as encouragement  _  her to try harder and succeed. And that made all the  _  ! With a positive  _  and being deaf to others' opinions, the second frog reached her goals by using such  _  as encouragement, instead of being  _  by others like the first frog, who failed to develop her  _  to struggle for survival.  _  , when we overcome others' criticism or  _  comments, we can do anything we set our minds to, just as the second frog did.",
