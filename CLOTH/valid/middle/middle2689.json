    "article": "One day, while I was sitting in my car in a parking lot, I noticed a young boy. He was bending down and  picking up  a coin from the ground. He bent down in front of my car, and when he stood up, we  _  each other clearly. He was no more than ten years old and was  _  one blue glove and one brown glove. His coat was too small for him.\nAs he walked away from me, I saw his shoes, which were too old to wear. I rolled down my  _  and called him over. He stopped and turned around to look at me.\nI asked him  _  he needed some money. He replied, \"No. That's okay.\"\nThe parking lot was  _ . I could tell that his feet were cold by the way he kept shifting his weight from one foot to the other.\n\"Please,\" I held out a five-dollar bill. \"It's not much, but when the money is shared, it is much more  _ ,\" I said.\nAfter hearing my kind words, he  took off  one of his gloves and reached for the money. His small hand was red and cold. That thin glove wasn't keeping his  _  warm at all.\nHe went away after  _  \"thank you\" to me. He smiled and waved his small hand at me. That smile made me feel warm in the cold winter.",
