    "article": "One day the bathroom door had slammed on Timmy's finger. The doctor asked if we had found the tip of Timmy's finger. He said there was a small chance of  _  it if we could get it to him quickly. I ran hurriedly back to the bathroom.  _  , it had already turned blue. I knew from the look on the doctor's face that it was too late. I felt helpless, unable to take the pain away from my little boy. Then a(n)  _  came to me. I whispered in his ear, \"Timmy, did you know that lizards grow their tails back and little boys can grow their fingers back too?\" Timmy's soft green eyes grew wide  _  excitement. \"They can?\" he asked, obviously surprised by the thought, \"And  _  ?\" I told him, \"Inside your head you have a little voice telling your finger how much you love it and how much you  _  it. \" I could see Timmy's little face focused in deep concentration. Then I continued, \" Now just say, grow for me finger, grow. I love you and I need you. \" A few  _  later, Timmy said to me quietly, \"I'm talking to my  _  every day, wishing it well. \" Weeks later, Timmy ran towards me. \" See, \" he said, \"It's growing back really good! \" A year later, Timmy's finger  _  back and became well again just as any finger could be. Timmy remains forever in my heart as a constant reminder of the  _  of miracles.",
