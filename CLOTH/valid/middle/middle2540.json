But this may not be the best way to make your home a 42. _  place.\nLast week we visited a park in Hebei. We were 43. _  to find most of the trees had been burned. The workers told us that the trees 44. _  soon after they were planted because they weren't watered well enough. 45. _  workers burned them and cleaned the place for 46. _  trees to be planted this year. 47. _  a card found in one of the dead trees, a student wrote,\" I hope this tree will grow up with me to 48. _  the backbone   of our country.\" The workers said that the survival   of the trees was really more important than 49. how many  trees were planted.\nSome people in Beijing now have a new idea that they can donate   some money and let professional   plant and 50. take care of  the trees.",
