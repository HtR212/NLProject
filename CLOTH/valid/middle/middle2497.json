    "article": "_  the first time, Zhang Shengyu, a student at Laiyang Middle School in Shandong, didn't ask her mother to buy her a new schoolbag or any new pens for the beginning of the school term. \"My old schoolbag can still be used, so there is no  _  to buy a new one,\" Zhang said. \"I've decided to be thrifty from now on. \" As the center of the  _  attention, many of the one-child generation do not know about the hardships of life. They sometimes have no idea of the value of money. Many students would  _  away pens and erasers that haven't been used up and buy new ones. Some like to compete with each other to see whose clothes and  school thing  are more expensive. The Ministry of Education put a notice on its website on Jan 20. It called on students to have good habits such as diligence and thrift, to stop wasting food and to pay  _  attention to famous brands. Many schools consider  _  the students the value of money and encourage their students to be  _  . Students at No 44 Middle School of Shijiazhuang, Hebei planted many fruit trees in their campus. By taking care of the trees, the students learned  _  to cherish things. At Tie Yi Middle School in Xi'an, students organized a group to collect used pen refills and use them for crafts . \"What we students do are small things,  _  I think with everyone's work, we can make a difference,\" said Li Dongdong, 16, a student at the school.",
