    "article": "Meyer has been crazy about writing since she was young. She got her first lesson in story-telling from  _  grandfather, who gave her words of love. He set off her imagination and influenced her much. Meyer always had stories running  _  her head and as soon as she could write, she put them down on paper. Meye  _  remembered the call that changed her life. It was Tuesday, February 18 , when the  _  rang in the kitchen of her Los Angeles home. On the line was Marty Banderas, a literary agent to whom she had sent a copy of her novel three weeks earlier. She asked Meyer some  _  information, like age and health condition. Meyer felt  _  and asked what that was about. Banderas only replied, \"I've just sold your  _  for one and a half million dollars!\" She sat down in shock. She had written over fourteen novels in twenty years, but each one had been  _  by publishers . Many people would have been discouraged ,  _  not her. Each time, she just got down to writing another one. Her husband advised her to find something else to do, but she never  gave up  . Seeing this book published was the most  _  thing that has ever happened to her. Now she is a  _  of three children, but she has never stopped  _  , turning out novels between kids and dishes. She is writing another novel now, and she expects another success. Yes, her belief has brought her  _  , and it has changed her life  in return  . Meyer is very confident that she will enjoy a more successful and meaningful life as long as she keeps on with her dream.",
