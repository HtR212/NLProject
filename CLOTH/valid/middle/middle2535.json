When they get to know you are a _ child, they will understand you better. This also helps you feel more comfortable in talks.\nTry to smile more. When you smile, people think you are _ and easy to talk with. Remember that other people have feelings too, and most people will keep away _ an angry-looking   face.\nLearn to be a good talker. If you find it hard to start a talk, say something nice about people around you. Think about how great you feel _ someone says something nice to you. You can't stop talking to that person, right?\nDon't _ too much. Think more about ways to enjoy parties or games. Don't _ too much time worrying about your look or whether  people like you or not. You will become relaxed  and find it's not so hard to talk with others.\nTake one small step  at a time. Each time after you say _ or smile at someone for the first time, say to _ \"I did it\", or even buy an ice cream as a reward .\nAlways try and one day you'll _ feel shy when you talk to others.",
