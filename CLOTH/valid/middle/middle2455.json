If you can recite the text and write it out, you will learn it pretty well. And if you can tell  _  your own words about  _  the lesson says, you are a very successful learner indeed. Your English will be quite perfect. This is a difficult task. However, if you try to learn by heart only part of each lesson, you'll find it not so hard  _  you might have thought. Learn this way, and you will  _  fast progress. Of course, writing is also necessary. It helps you a lot on your way to  _  in English studies. It's equally important to feel the language. You should laugh at Englsih jokes and be  _  at bad news. When using English, try to  _  your mother tongue .  Instead of  helping you, your own language gets in your way. So, never try to learn English through putting every word into Chinese.",
