He then asks the class: \"Is the bottle _ now?\" They all answer: \"Yes!\"\nThe teacher then takes some small stones and puts them into the _ .The small stones go into the room _ the big stones. He then asks: \"Is it full?\" This time _ students give no answer, but most answer: \"Yes!\"\nThe teacher then starts to drop some _ into the bottle. The sand   goes into the room between the small stones. For the _ time, the teacher asks: \"Is it full?\" Now most are thinking, but still, some say: \"Yes!\"\nThen the teacher brings out a cup of water into the bottle and asks: \"What's the point of this _ ?\" One angry student answers: \"You can  _ find time to do more things.\"\n\"No,\" says the teacher. \"The point is that if you don't put the big stones first, you'll never get them in. The big stones are the  _ things in your life. If you your life is full of small things, the sand and the water - you'll never have the time for the important things.\"",
