She has taught me so many things that I will carry with me _ my life.\nOne thing I've learned from Julia is how to balance _ . Julia has shown me how to _ ahead so that I can finish all my schoolwork, enjoy sports and _ have time for my friends. I have also learned that you can find anything interesting _ you connect it with something you enjoy.\nLast year I hated studying vocabulary, but I loved playing computer games. Julia combined(......)the two and showed me a website called \"freerice. com\"where you can play a word game. Each time you use a correct word, you can donate 5 grains of rice to the poor. Thanks to the game, I _ about 1,000 words in just one month.\nJulia had a good effect on me. Without Julia's help. I probably wouldn't have _ how easy it is to help the poor. There are so many ways that one person can make a difference . I've learned to be more grateful for what I own. I am very _ for the opportunities that I have been given. I will never give up helping those less fortunate in the rest of my life.",
