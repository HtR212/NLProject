Now in China, he has found that his family  _  like a tall tree with long roots. Robert is just one young overseas Chinese who  has come  to visit his ancestors' homeland, as part of the In Search of Roots summer camp program. The program  is organized  by the local government of Guangdong Province. This program started in 1980, and so far has brought  thousands of  overseas Chinese students to China to look for their families' roots. The young people are usually between 16 and 25 years old. Most, like Robert, can hardly  _  any Chinese and have never been to China before. The students mainly visit parts of Guangdong Province in southern China. During the  two-week  camp, they study Chinese culture, see changes that have happened in that area, and visit interesting sights. Going to their ancestors' village is often  the most exciting  part of the trip.The students feel that they are part of the village, and  _  village life. They drink from the village well, go for walks  _  the countryside, and watch the villagers do their daily activities. Cathy Qian, a young American student, had this to say, \"  Thanks to  In Search of Roots, I am beginning to understand my Chinese roots and who I am. It has been a great trip, and I have  too many  memories of China to take with me .\" The program leaders believe  _  in the program and say that the purpose of it is to give young overseas Chinese the chance to learn more about  _  . \"I've really enjoyed the trip so far,\" says Robert.\"This has been a big step for me, and I'm looking forward to  finding out  more about my roots during my time here.",
