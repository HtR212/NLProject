He  _  a gun to Mr. Smith's head. \"Drive me to Paris!\" he shouted. \"All right,\" Mr. Smith answered. He started the engine , pulled away from the side of the street and  _  down. Being 81 years old, he knew he could not fight with the gunman. He knew he needed help . Where were the police? As he drove  _  each crossing, he looked up and down the side streets, hoping to find a police car, but he could see  _  . \"Just my luck,\" he thought. \"If I were driving too  _  , there would be a police car on every corner.\" Suddenly he pushed his foot down on the accelerator , and the car went  _  faster. \"What are you doing?\" shouted the gunman. \"To  keep away from  the police,\" Mr. Smith answered. \"I thought I saw a police car near there.\" He ran red lights, drove wrong on one-way streets. On the two-way streets, he drove on the wrong side of the road. None of the policemen saw him. Again, Mr. Smith's plan was not working. He had to try a new plan. He turned at a corner and saw the  police station  in front. Then he drove his car as fast as he could towards the police gate. The car knocked a police motorbike over and stopped. Mr. Smith shouted, \"Help! Help!\" Then he  _  back to grab the man's gun. At the same time the policemen heard the noise and quickly caught the gunman.",
