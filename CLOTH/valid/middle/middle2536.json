I passed the living room and wished I could watch TV, but I knew my  _  would take me the whole night. I took my schoolbag and went  _  to my room. I tried to understand chemistry and fight with sleepiness at the same time. I tried to keep my eyes open and wanted something to cheer me up.\nLater, I heard the sound of the front door opening. And I waited for it--- the sound of my mum singing. Though she sang off-key, it made me excited. I ran down to  _  my mum. We hugged each other and talked for a while. I liked it when my mum was happy. Her energy seemed to run down to me and I got the strength to  _  the stress again.\nSometimes, I wonder how my mum can still be  _  after coming back from work. Every weekday, she wakes up early in the morning to go to work and spends an hour on the bus. After work, my mum at times gets trapped in  _ for two hours on her way home. When I  _  my school life with her work life, I should not be the one to  _ . At least I have some interesting things to do at school. I notice that my mum lives her life with a joyous heart, which encouraged me to do my work well,  _  there may be difficulties. Seeing her happy makes me feel good too.",
