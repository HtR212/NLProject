In the family, nobody else went into the kitchen except me.  But that night, as I _ to him that a colander is the thing with holes in it,I wondered what else I hadn't _ Ray for.\nAs parents,while we focus on our sons' confidence and character,we perhaps don't always consider that we are _ raising someone's future roommates,boyfriends, husbands,or fathers. _ I came up with a plan: I would offer Ray a private home economics course. I was _ to find that he didn't say no. For two hours, three days a week, Ray was all mine.\nI knew that he would rather have been playing basketball with friends than _ to mend socks with his mother,but in fact he was learning, and more than just housekeeping. \"I appreciate what you do _ a mom,\" he told me one day. Ray now realizes there's _ masculine about being helpless.\nNow,not only can he make his own dinner, but also he can make a big meal for his family. That's _ I call a man. I'm glad that I prepared so great a present for my future daughter in-law.",
