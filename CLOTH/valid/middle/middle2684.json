Please come in and have something  to eat  .\" \"We don't go into a house  _  \"they replied. \"Why is that?\" she asked. One of the old men answered, \"His name is Wealth , this is Success, and I am Love.\" Then he said, \"Now go in and  _  with your family which one of us you want in your house.\" The woman went in and told her family what had happened, she said, \"Let's invite Wealth. We have been so  _  .\" Her husband disagreed, \"My dear, why don't we invite Success? Don't you want me to be a successful man? Then her daughter asked, \"Would it be  _  to invite Love? Our life will then be filled with love!\" In the end the family decided to take the  _  advice. The woman went out and asked, \"  _  one of you is Love? Please come in and be our guest.\" Love got up and started walking to the house. The other two also got up and  _  him. Surprised, the lady asked Wealth and Success, \" I  _  invite Love. Why are you coming along? The two old men answered, \"If you had invited Wealth or Success, the other two would have to stay out, but since you have invited Love.  _  he goes, we go with him. Where there is Love, there is Wealth and Success.\"",
