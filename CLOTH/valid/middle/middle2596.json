It was summer when I first  _  two golden hamsters. They  _  brown, about the size of my hand. When I  _  by, they were cracking melon seeds . They did that as  _  as any human! I was so amused that I bought them at once. The only one who was not happy to see the newcomers was my  _  . She thought  _  would make our home dirty all the time. So I made a  _  for them on the balcony . Hamsters always want people to look at them. They try to get noticed by raising the front part of their body,  _  they watch you come and go until you stop and talk to them. Watch out when they start to roller-turn in their cage . They won't stop  _  you have tears of laugher! Hamsters are  _  than you think. One morning several months ago, I found one missing. The side of the cage was much  taller  than the hamster and the cage had a lid. How did the little one climb up, open the lid and  run away  ? I thought hard. But I've  _  found an answer.",
