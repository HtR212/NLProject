We listen to the music, and we _ the national flag  go up.\nUsually, one student gives a talk on Monday mornings. One Monday last year, a boy gave the talk. He was _ and excited! When I saw him, I wanted to have a try, too. Can I really do it?\nLast week, our teacher said our class should give the talk. My teacher _ me, \"I know you want to have a try. Next Monday, you can give the talk. Go and write something down. _ for it, I'm sure you'll do well.\" \"Thank you ,\" I answered.It was such a great _ for me !\nWhen I got home , I was excited. I wrote two pages for the talk. I read them again and again. When I read, I asked my parents _ me. I wanted to do my best to make it perfect .\nMonday morning came. I began to feel _ . When did I last give a talk to _ many people?\nNever! This was my first time. Could I really _ it? Maybe I couldn't finish the talk.\nWhen I got to school, we all went out to playground. I _ in front of everyone. I opened my mouth, but I couldn't say anything. \"Take it easy,\" I said to _ . \"Don't be nervous. You can do it.\"\nJust then, I looked down at everyone. I saw about 1,000 eyes. They were all looking at me !\nI couldn't _ stand up. I looked at their eyes more carefully. Their eyes were saying , \"You can do it! Don't be afraid, just talk !\" I _ a big breath. Then I began to talk.It wasn't hard. It was easy. I don't know _ I finished my talk. But I did it. I felt so good that day. I showed myself _ everyone what I can do.",
