    "article": "Dear Editor I am writing to you to  _  you about my problems with my family. I am very  _  now and I need your help. I don't think my parents  _  me. They don't care what I like doing, but always talk about how  I should  study. They don't let me  go  out with my friends at weekends. They always ask me  to stay at  home and study. I'm sure I could still study very well even if I had more time to play, but they just  don't listen to  me. We often argue with  each other  . I really hope that my parents can  _  my friends. What shall I do ? How can I get them to understand me? Please give me  some advice  . Thank you ! Yours Michael",
