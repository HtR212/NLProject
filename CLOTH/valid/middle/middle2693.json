    "article": "It is very important to stay  _  . I have a neighbor. She is an old lady. She can do all the housework,  _  newspapers, watch TV and search on the Internet to learn something new. I often see  _  do taijiquan in the morning and dance in the evening. She looks young and beautiful  _  she is over seventy. Last week a reporter from a magazine interviewed her and asked  _  she kept so young and healthy. She replied  _  a smile. I have a secret of staying young and healthy. It is quite  _  . Keep your mind active,take an interest in the world  _  you, and learn at least one new thing every day. Try to do different kinds of housework and do sports as  _  as you can. Don't think you are too old to go back to  _  . I know a man who entered a medical college when  _  was 70 years old. He studied there for 6 years and now he is a doctor. Another man  _  to a tennis school at the age of 71 and now he is good at  _  tennis. Some people may say staying young is easy only for those who live in the future. In fact, no matter how old you are, you can make it. Please  _  the story to your family. It would be a good start to  _  the lady's example. I hope all people will stay young and healthy.",
