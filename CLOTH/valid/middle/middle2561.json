    "article": "Being on the road at 3:15 am to drive 450 kilometers wasn't in my plans for the weekend. I had been looking forward to a few  _  days to prepare myself for the following busy  _  . My son, Simon, and his good friends were heading for the snowfield. I  _  my car to make sure that everyone could get to the drop-off point so that they could get together and enjoy their week's  _  by snowboarding and skiing. The only thing that l was thinking of on my journey was that as soon as I  _  and said goodbye,1 would make the trip  _  ,in total, a round trip of 900 kilometers in just 10 hours. Such a long drive in one day was frightening, particularly as I was looking forward to relaxation. Simon and I talked, on our way, a little about his break and a whole lot of his school subjects. It was great to have this time with him as we  _  spent five continuous hours together. On my return trip, I  _  a strange sense of loneliness in some heavy morning fog. Within an hour it cleared. I spent the next four hours listening to some CDs and enjoying the scenery. Surprisingly, after my long trip home l was  _  refreshed and energized even though 1 was physically tired. And I knew that l would have a good sleep that evening. A change in your environment, no matter how great, can provide you with the chance to look at something from different ways, as well as to be refreshed and energized. Now I'm looking forward to my next  _  event and many more chances to spend quality time with those who are important to me and make my life more rewarding.",
