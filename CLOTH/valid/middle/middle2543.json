She carried the pole with the pots  _  her neck.\nOne of the pots had a crack in it while the other pot was perfect and always filled a full pot of water. At the end of the long  _  from the well to the house, the cracked pot  _ only half-full left.\nFor two years this happened daily, with the woman bringing home only  one and a half  pots of water. Of course, the perfect pot was  _ . But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection.\nOne day, the cracked pot spoke to the woman  _  the well:\"I am ashamed of myself because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your  _ .\"\nThe old woman smiled:\"Did you notice that there are  _  on your side of the path, but not on  the other  pot's side? That's because I have  _  known about your crack, so I  _  flower seeds on your side of the path. And every day while we walk back, you  _  them.\" She added, \" For  two  years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate the table. Without you, being just the  _  you are, I would not have this beauty.\"\nEach of us has our own cracks. But it's these  _  that make our lives together so interesting and meaningful.",
