Later that day, I happened to pass Jeff in the dining room. I offered  _  a polite \"Congratulations\" and walked to my usual table. To my  _  , Jeff came to me and put his plate beside mine. \"I'm, er-I'm just wondering if you would consider coming to work on my team, \"he said nervously. \"You are really  _  and you would be a great partner.\" \"I don't think so,\" I replied, feeling unsure. \"Well,  _  you change your mind, you can tell me tomorrow. \"He said before moving to another table. All that night, I thought about the  _  from Jeff. Maybe being a part of the election process would give me a chance to make important changes at our school. I decided to  _  Jeff.  _  of all, I began to create a catchy advertisement. Within a few days, we  _  a poster with Jeff's showing him in a number of activities. No one could walk through any hallway  _  passing Jeff's smiling face. My next step was to  find out  what new activities students would like to have at our school. Many of them wanted a chess club and a volleyball team. With the information I had collected, Jeff met with the headmaster. The headmaster agreed to add  _  we want to our school program. With my help, Jeff and our ideas were well received at school. An eighth grader said, \"  _  will be exciting to have Jeff as president.\"  _  these words made my heart filled with pride. I had wanted to become president of Student Union to make a difference. Now I achieved that. Jeff became the most popular candidate and I was a large part of his  _  .
