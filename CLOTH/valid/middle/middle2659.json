    "article": "There were no classes that afternoon, so Henry went to a  _  shop near his home. The shop sold many jackets. He looked  _  them and at last chose a very nice one. He  _  it on and then told the shopkeeper to put it  _  a bag. At that time his friend Bruce came into the shop. They hadn't seen each other for a long time. They were so  _  to meet again that they forgot  _  else. Soon they were busy talking on and on happily. It was nearly six o'clock,  so  they decided to go and have dinner together. Henry picked up the bag, and walked  to  the door of the shop. The shopkeeper stopped them and asked Henry to pay for the jacket. Henry looked at him in  _  at first, but soon he remembered that he hadn't paid for it. He said  _  , gave him the money and then left the shop with his friend.",
