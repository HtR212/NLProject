Do you have the same problem? Why does it  _  that some parents are not so friendly in their children's eyes? Your parents  worry about  everything about you, from the time you were born. They do a lot for you,  _  something would make you angry, because they care about you and worry about you. They tell you the  _  of making friends. They ask you to concentrate on your lessons  instead of  computer games. They also worry about how much sleep you get and tell you it's bad for your health to  stay up  . They want you to grow up healthily and happily. So how can you make things easier on yourself? It's easier than you think. Just make sure your parents  _  what you are doing. Call them if you stay somewhere else later than usual. Say sorry to them you make  _  . Talk about your ideas with them. They may talk about theirs with you. School rules  must be obeyed  anytime. Someday when you become a parent, you may be able to know how to get along with your children.",
