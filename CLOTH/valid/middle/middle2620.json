Heavy schoolbags have been a serious  _  for a long time. But the e-schoolbag will  work it out  . An e-schoolbag is  _  lighter than a usual schoolbag. Perhaps, the e-schoolbag should be  _  an e-textbook. It is a small computer for students. It is as  small  as a usual book,  _  it can still have all the things for study, such as textbooks, exercise books and so on which can be made  _  chips like stamps. The students can read the text page by page on the screen, take notes, or even send e-mails to their teachers. They only need to  _  the right chip into the e-schoolbag. Then they can use it. Some people say  _  e-textbooks can be easily broken, while others say it is not good for eyes. But only time will tell.",
