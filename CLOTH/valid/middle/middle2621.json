Something important _ there and it changed me greatly.\nWe arrived there early in the morning and began to climb. Soon all of us felt tired because the stairs were really steep  . An hour later, we stopped to have a rest. While we were having a rest, my mother changed her _ and decided not to climb any more. I couldn't decide whether to stay there or go on climbing  with my father. \"No matter how hard it is, I am _ you can get there,\" said my father. So again we _ the hard journey. We were very tired, _ we kept going on and on. Another hour later, we reached the top. It was really beautiful. My father and I were so excited that we couldn't help jumping up happily. What an interesting trip!",
