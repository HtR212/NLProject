    "article": "Sam waited patiently in the long line at the grocery store . He had come to  _  a few things for his mother. He often did  _  for his parents after school. He enjoyed helping out at home.  _  he waited, he daydreamed about the new camera he wanted to buy. He wanted to buy it soon  _  his family was going on a vacation, and he wanted to take pictures of their trip. There was only one problem. He needed seven  more  dollars to buy the camera. His lawn-mowing job at Mr Smith's should  _  the money soon. Suddenly Sam was shoved aside . He recognized Mrs Sanders, an unkind and  _  person who lived in his block. She had shoved in front of him without even smiling. Just as Mrs Sanders received her change and things she had bought, a ten-dollars bill flew out of her hand and  _  at Sam's feet. Mrs Sanders was  _  busy criticizing the clerk for his slowness to notice it. As Sam bent down to pick up the money, he thought quickly. The money did  belong to  Mrs Sanders ,but she deserved to lose it after the way she had behaved , and, with it, he could buy the camera.",
