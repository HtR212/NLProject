    "article": "Jim, a successful businessman, told the experience of his childhood. When he was 12 years old, his parents died. He was alone and didn't get on well with others. People always laughed at him. No one showed  _  to him. His only friend was a dog named Tige. He gave his dog enough to eat and drink, but sometimes he was not  _  to it. He didn't know that an unkind word sometimes could cut one's heart like a knife. One day as he walked down the street, a young lady was walking in front of him. One of her bags dropped from her arms. As she stopped to  pick it up  , she dropped other bags. He came to help her. \"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!\" She said kindly, smiling. A special feeling came to him. It was the first time that he had heard such kind words. He watched her  _  she went far away, and then he whistled to his dog and went directly to the river  _  . \"Thanks, dear! You are a nice little boy!\" He repeated what the woman said. Then in a low  _  he said to his dog, \"You are a nice little dog.\" Tige raised its ears as if it understood. \"Hmm! Even a dog likes it!\"he said. \"Well, Tige, I won't say anything unkind to you  any more  .\" Tige waved its tail happily. The boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw  _  but a dirty boy. He washed his face carefully. Again he saw a  _  nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he started a new life. After telling this, the businessman said, \"This is the very place in which that kind woman planted the first seed of kindness in my heart.\" What a great  _  it has!",
