    "article": "Many teenagers have hobbies.But sometimes these hobbies can get  in the  way of schoolwork. and Parents might worry about their  _  at school.Teenagers often think they should be allowed to practice their hobbies as much as they want.Do you agree? Liu Yu, a  fifteen-year-old  boy from Shandong.is a running star.He is on his school running team and has always wanted to be a professional athlete.However,his parents won't allow him to tram as much as he would like. \"Of course we want to see Liu Yu  achieve  his dream.\"says Mr. Liu.\"and we know  how much  he loves running. That's great.and my wife and I have watched him in every one of his races.We have nothing  _  running. But we do think that our son needs to be realistic.Now that he is getting older. he needs to think about what will happen  _  he doesn't become a professional runner in the end. Liu Yu really  disagrees  .\"Well.I think I should be allowed to make decisions for myself.\"he says.\"My parents have always taught me the  _  of working hard and not just to do what I enjoy. I understand this. But I'm serious about running.  Being  a professional runner is the only thing I have ever wanted to do. Mr. and Mrs. Liu believe that Liu Yu should study hard in the evenings. and so they don't allow him to practice  running  on school nights.\"I know this  _  seem strict,\"says Mrs. Liu\"but we think we're doing the right thing.He has to understand very  few  people can become professional athletes. It's a very difficult dream to achieve. so we think he needs to spend more time  _  his homework. But Liu Yu still doesn't agree.I know my parents care about me,but they are always talking about what  will happen  if I don't succeed in the future.But I will succeed! I think I should be allowed to make this decision for myself.Only then will I have a chance of achieving my dream.",
