There was no _ for them to pass, so one goat said to the other, \"Go back. There is no room for _ of us to cross.\"\n\"Why should I go back?\" said the other goat. \" _ don't you go back instead?\"\n\"You must go back\", said the first goat. \"because I am _ than you.\"\n\"But I don't think so,\" said the second goat.\n\"We will see about that,\" said the first goat. And he _ his horns  to fight.\n\"Stop!\" said the second goat. \"If we fight, we will both _ into the river and drown. I have an idea--I will lie down, and you may _ over me.\"\nThen the clever goat lay down on the bridge, and the other goat _ went over him. _ they passed each other, and went on their ways.",
