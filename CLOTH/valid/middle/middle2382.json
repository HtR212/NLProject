I have some good news for you.\" says the fox. \"Oh?\" asks the cock. \"What is it?\" \"All the animals  _  good friends now.  _  be friends, too. Please come down and play with me.\" \"Fine!\" says the cock. \"I'm very happy to hear that.\" Then he looks up. \"Look! There is something over there.\" \"  _  are you looking at?\" asks the fox. \"Oh. I see some animals over there.  They are  coming this way.\" \"Animals?\" \"Yes. Oh, they're dogs.\" \"What? Dogs!\" says the fox. \"Err..., I  must go  now. Goodbye.\" \"Wait, Mr. fox,\" says the cock. \"  _  go. They are only dogs.
