    "article": "A saint found a group of family members shouting angrily at each other on a river bank. He asked his disciples , \"  _  do people shout when they are angry with each other?\" The disciples  _  for a while and one of them said, \"Because they lose their calm.\" \"But why should they shout when the other persons are just  across from  them? They can tell them what they have to say in a  _  manner.\" Asked the saint. The disciples gave some other answers but  _  made the saint pleased. Finally the saint  _  , \"When two people are angry with each other, their hearts distance a lot. To cover that distance they must shout in order to  hear  each other. The angrier they are, the  _  they will have to shout to cover that great distance. What happens when two people fall in love? They don't shout at each other but talk softly, because their hearts are very close. The distance  _  them is very small or doesn't exist .\" The saint looked at his disciples and continued, \"So when you argue with other people, do not say words that distance each other, or else there will come a day when the distance is so great that you will not find the  _  to return.",
