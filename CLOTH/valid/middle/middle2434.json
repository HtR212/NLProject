It said, \"Enjoy a week of sightseeing in one of Europe's most beautiful cities  _  staying at one of its best hotels. \" Now I wasn't so sure. I had waited fifteen minutes at reception when I  _  and now the shower in my room wasn't working. I called hotel reception. \"Hello. This is Room 308. There isn't any  _  in my bathroom. \" \"Are you sure?\" \"Of course I'm sure! \"I'll  _  our hotel engineer at once. \" An hour later, the engineer came to look at the shower. He hit the pipes a few times and looked  _  . \"Sorry, but I cannot fix it today. Maybe, tomorrow.\" Then he  held out  his hand. I couldn't believe it! He wanted a tip for doing  _  ! I was very angry. But suddenly, I had a better idea.  _  , I gave the engineer a few coins. He hadn't fixed my shower but he had taught me something about staying in his country. Two minutes later I was at the reception desk. I explained the problem to the receptionist and he replied, \"Sorry. This is a  _  situation, but what can we do?\" I knew exactly what to do. I gave the hotel manager a very large tip. Fifteen minutes later I  _  into Room 405. It was twice the size of Room 308, it had a wonderful view of the city, a comfortable bed and, most importantly, there was water in the bathroom.",
