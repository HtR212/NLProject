Because she has a piano lesson in the morning and in the afternoon she has to babysit her sister. So I will do everything by myself. I try to make  _  party nice. I sent invitation to my friends  yesterday  . Now I am thinking about what I need to do tomorrow. Yes! I have to clean the room and do some shopping. I am going  to buy  some food, drinks and some fruit in the supermarket. I am going to make a shopping list  _  I go. I also have to decorate the room. I need to do so many things, so I  _  see the movie \"Da Vinci Code\" after lunch. A terrible thing! The party begins  _  8 pm, so I must have my dinner  _  . I am tired after I finish  doing  so many things and after dinner I can have a short rest.",
