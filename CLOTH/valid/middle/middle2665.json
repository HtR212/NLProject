I will certainly study hard and learn the skills. Then I can  _  my family difficulties and do good to other people.\" a learner on the job training program said, feeling  _  . The learner's grandfather is nearly 80 years old, and his mother is  _  in bed. So his father, who is a farmer, is the main  _  of the family. The family is poor. The learner graduated from high school and did not  _  the college entrance exam . The job training program helps him learn the skills that he'll  _  in the work place. The story reminds me of another  _  . It goes like this: Once upon a time, there was a man who liked fishing very much, and was  _  to catch lots of fish every day. The man was a kind-hearted person, so he always  _  his fish with his neighbors who did not know how to fish. One day, he thought that it would be  _  if he taught them how to fish. So he  _  his neighbors together and showed them how to fish. Everybody was very happy that they could  _  the fish they themselves caught. At present, there are still a lot of poor people all over the world. But it's not good if we give only  _  to them.  _  , we should give them a chance to learn new skills. Therefore, a technical training is very important to people in need, and they will learn the ability to  _  money. People can learn a lot of useful things in the training program and what they learn can help them on the way to find jobs.",
