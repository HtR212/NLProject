    "article": "Now computers are very  _  among young people. Last week, we asked thirty young people  _  fourteen and eighteen. We asked how much  _  they usually spent on their computers in a week, but we  _  most interested in  _  they used their computers for. The usual time spent on a computer in a week was about twelve hours, with  the highest  user about thirty-two hours, and the lowest user only five hours. All the children said they usually used computers  to play games  . Fourteen children told us they did some word processing  at times  . Only two of them said computers  helped with  their lessons, and eight children told us they kept addresses and phone numbers in their computers or used  _  to write diaries. Only three children said they were learning to make computer programs and nobody looked up databases . None of them used computers for any  other  use. The  _  show that computer use is quite high among young people of 14-18 years old. They also show quite clearly that computers  are seen  by most young people as little more than game machines.  It seems to us that  , though computers are common in the homes of young people, they have not yet become  _  in everyday life.",
