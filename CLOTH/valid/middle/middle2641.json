As she stood there, she saw a policeman  _  towards her. \"Excuse me, madam,\" said the policeman. \" Can you read  that  sign over there?\" \"Yes, I can,\" said Mrs. Smith. \" It  _  'No Parking'. \"Right. Madam. So  _  have you parked your car here? I shall have to give you a parking ticket. \" \"But this isn't my car,\" said Mrs. Smith. \"Isn't it?\" said the policeman, and his face turned red. \"I'm very sorry.  _  I shall have to put a ticket on the front of the car. \" Before he was not able to finish writingthe ticket,  another  woman had arrived.
