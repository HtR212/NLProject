A smile  _  your face shows you are happy and friendly. Tears  in your eyes tell  others  that you are sad. When you  put up  your hand in class, the teacher knows you want to say something  _  ask questions. You shake  your head, and people know you are saying no. You nod  and people know you are saying  _ .\nOther things can also carry messages. For example , a sign at the bus stop helps you to know which bus  to take . A sign on the wall of your school helps you to  _  the library. Signs on doors tell you where to go in or out. Do you notice that there are a lot of signs  around  you and that you receive  messages  _  them all the time? People can talk to each other  _  many other ways.  _  artist can use his drawings to tell about beautiful mountains, about the blue sea and many other things. Writers write books to  _  you about all wonderful things in the world and also about people and their ideas. Books, magazines, TVs, radios and films all help us to talk with other people.
