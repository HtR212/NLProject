Last week I finished my end-of-year exam. The  _  exam to me was Maths. All of its questions were from earlier exams. So I finished it soon. The biology exam was hard. At first, I thought I would  _  it. It asked about lots of things we never studied in class, though we could  open  textbooks. And there wasn't enough time to check every question.
