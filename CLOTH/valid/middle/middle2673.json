Last month, I had a _ at last to go on such a holiday with some of my schoolmates and we went to London, a place that I had wanted to  _ visit since years ago.\nAs we were still _ , we had a group leader who _ things carefully for us and looked after us. After we got to London, we went to stay with _ families. I was lucky that my host family   was a white couple who had a daughter about my age. They _ me as a daughter of their family during my stay there. They were _ in me and I learnt a lot of things from them, too.\nThe holiday was filled with _ every day. After breakfast, a local teacher would come to _ us in his car. Then we would have classes or go on a sight-seeing trip to different places of interest like the Big Ben, the London Bridge, and the Buckingham Palace. We would go _ to our own homes after the activities.\nThe holiday was a valuable _ for me. I enjoyed every minute of it. Yet, time really flew fast.
