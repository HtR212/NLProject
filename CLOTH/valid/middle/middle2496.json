We learn these and other skills by _ .\nThen we go to school, A teacher tells us _ to learn and how to learn. Many teachers teach us, and we pass many tests and exams. Then people say we are educated. Are we really educated? Let's think about the real meaning of learning.  Knowing facts[:doesn't _ being able to solve problems. Solving problems requires creativity, not just a good memory. Some people who don't know many facts can also be good at solving problems.\nHenry Ford is a good example . He left school at the age of 15. Later, when his company couldn't build cars _ enough, he solved the speed problem. He thought of the assembly line . Today the answer seems simple. Yet, just think of the many university graduates-who never solve any problems,\nWhat does a good teacher do? Does he give students facts to remember? Well, yes, we must sometimes remember facts. _ a good teacher shows how to find answers. He[ brings us to the stream of knowledge so we can think for ourselves. When we are thirsty, we know where to go.\nTrue learning combines intake with output. We take information _ our brains.Then we use it. Think of a computer; it stores a lot of information, but it can't think. It only obeys commands, A person who only remembers facts hasn't really learned. Learning takes _ only when a person can use what he knows.",
