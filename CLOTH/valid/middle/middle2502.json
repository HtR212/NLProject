Now he is wondering what will happen to the old one. \"Well, after being broken up into small pieces, it will be sent to China by ship. \" his friend tells Mike. Things like this  _  . Every day. Last month Hong Kong officers found 131,000kilograms of broken computers, TVs and phones. They had been sent to China illegally . Computers are filled with  _  things like mercury and lead . So every time an old computer is broken , it needs to be dealt with safely. Of course ,  _  to deal with broken computers has been a problem. Some countries like Japan and the US send their e-waste to China. Guiyu, a town in Guangdong Province, has been called the e-waste capital of the world. The town has to  deal with  1.5 million kilograms of e-waste each year. This earns $75 million, but it comes at immense cost . Many harmful things in e-waste find  _  own way into the environment. Plastic is burned outdoors and acids are  poured into  rivers or seas. Greenpeace, an environmental group , has said that the earth and rivers of Guiyu have been  _  polluted. This year  _  will make its first law about waster-recycling. The Chinese government wants to develop cities and towns, but in a way  _  doesn't damage the environment or people's lives. Money has been given by computer companies like Lenovo and Founder to  _  deal with computer waste. These companies will also be asked to take back their old computers. This is because they know best how to deal with them safely.",
