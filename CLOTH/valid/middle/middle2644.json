I walked _ because there was nothing much to see. Suddenly*, I found myself standing in front of two paths*. \"Which way should I go?\" I asked myself when I looked at the two different paths. One was wide and clean  _ flowers on both sides*. But the other  didn't look nice. It was narrow*and dirty. Grass grew everywhere. Of course I wanted to take the  _ way. But a strange feeling made me choose the dirty path. It wasn't nice, but I didn't give up. At last, I came to the end of the path. Ah! There was a nice small garden there, maybe  the most beautiful  garden in my hometown. There were green trees, colorful flowers and lovely chairs. I thought it was the nicest area of the park. And I spent a  _  afternoon in it.\nMy trip to the park made me understand something about life. Why not  try a different way next time? Don't be afraid! You may get a big surprise.",
