The man was  _  angry that he ran to his son, grabbed the hammer from  _  , and used the hammer to hit the little boy's hands too hard. The  _  boy cried out but his father didn't care. When the father  calmed down  , he took his son to the  _  as fast as he could. Although the doctor tried his best to save the  _  bones , he had to cut the fingers from both of the boy's hands in the end. When the boy  woke up  in the hospital and saw his hands, he innocently said, \"Dady, I'm sorry about your car.\" Then he asked, \"but  _  are my fingers going to grow back?\" The father  _  very sad. Think about the story when  someone  steps on your feet or when you wish to take revenge . Think first before you lose your patience with someone. Cars can  be repaired  , but broken bones and hurt feelings often can't. People often make mistakes. But we should remember that forgiveness is greater than revenge.  Think  before act!",
