    "article": "Dear Miss Li, I'd like to thank you for sending money  _  \"Animal Helpers\", an organization set up to help disabled people. You see, you have helped  _  it possible for me to have \"Lucky\". My life  is full of  pleasure because of him now. Let me tell you my story. Being blind, deaf, unable to walk or use your hands  _  is something that most people cannot imagine. But there are many people who face these challenges, and I am one of them. Because I can't use my arms or legs well, things like answering the telephone, opening and  _  doors or carrying things have always been difficult for me. Then one day last year, a friend of mine said that she would like to  help me out  . She said she would talk to \"Animal Helpers\" to see  _  it would be possible for me to get a trained dog. She also thought a dog might cheer me up. I told her that I love animals and that I'd love to have a dog.  _  six months of training with a dog at \"Animal Helpers\", I was able to  _  him home. My dog's name is \"Lucky\" - a good name for him  because  I feel very lucky to have him. You see, I'm only able to have a \"dog-helper\" because of your kind donation!  How does Lucky help me  , you might ask? Well, he has been trained to  _  different instructions. For example, I say, \"Lucky! Fetch my book,\" and he does it at once. He is very clever and understands many English words, even some difficult  _  like \"upstairs\". Lucky is an  _  dog. I'll send you a photo of him if you like, and I could show you how he helps me too one day. And so I thank you again for supporting \"Animal Helpers\". It is very important that this organization does not run out of money. Your donation  is greatly appreciated  and the money is well used to help disabled people like me. Best wishes, Liz Smith",
