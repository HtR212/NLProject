The other frogs kept telling them to  _  . Finally, one of the frogs believed what the other frogs were saying and  gave up  . He fell down and died. The other frog continued to jump as  _  as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs shouted at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and  _  made it out.
