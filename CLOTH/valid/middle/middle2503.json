    "article": "Everybody wants a new start for a new school year. So, students often go back-to-school shopping. They buy school things and shoes. But, the story is not so easy. \"Mum, I want this pair of shoes!\" \"Dear! Those are 900 yuan! That is too  _  !\" \"But all the boys in my class wear this brand !\" So the real story is: Kids  want  to catch up with school fashion. Chinese students  wear  uniforms at school. Parents think all the kids look the same, but kids know the differences. The \"rich\" kids wear amazing watches, ride good  _  and use cool pencil cases. They show off their expensive things to  other  kids. Then everyone else wants them too. For example, some \"rich\" kids use a pencil box that  _  1,000 yuan! It not only holds pencils, but also has a thermometer , a compass , a music box and even games in it! But think about it. Do you really need  _  a special pencil box? What can you do with a compass or a thermometer in class? They only distract you. As for these \"rich\" kids, they are not rich at all.  _  parents buy them all their school things. They may have an advantage now, but it won't last forever. If you want to show off  how much  money you have, you have to make it yourself first. So, study hard. You will get a great job in the future. Parents should also learn  _  to refuse their kids' demands . They should tell their kids: as students, what is really important is not school fashion but good school grades.",
