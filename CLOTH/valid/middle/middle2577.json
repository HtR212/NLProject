    "article": "I am a mother of three and have recently completed my college degree. The last class I had to take was sociology . The teacher was really great. The class was asked to go out and smile at three people. I am a very  _  person and thought this would be a piece of cake. Soon after, my husband, youngest son and I went out to McDonald's. We were standing in line, waiting to be  _  , when all of a sudden everyone around us began to  _  away, and then even my husband did. As I turned around I smelled a terrible \"dirty body\" smell, and there standing behind me were two poor  _  men. As I looked down at the short gentleman, he was \"  _  \". His beautiful sky blue eyes were full of God's Light as he searched for acceptance. He said, \"Good day.\" as he counted the few  _  he had been holding. The young lady at the counter asked him what they  _  . He said, \"Coffee is all Miss.\" because that was all they could afford. He just needed to be warm. Then I really  _  it--the compulsion was so great that I almost  _  out and hugged the little man with the blue eyes. That is when I noticed all eyes in the restaurant were set on me, judging my every action. I smiled and asked the young lady behind the counter to give  _  two more breakfast meals on two plates. I then picked up the plates and walked around the counter to the  _  that the men had chosen as a resting place. I put the plates on the table and laid my hand on the blue-eyed gentleman's  _  hand. He looked up at me, with tears in his eyes, and said, \"Thank you.\" I graduated with one of the biggest lessons I would ever learn:acceptance without condition.",
