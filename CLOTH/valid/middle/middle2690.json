Not quite sure how to _ her, he called the family doctor to discuss the problem. The doctor told him there was a simple test the husband could do to give the doctor a better _ of her hearing loss.\n\"Here's what you do,\" said the doctor. \"Stand about 40 feet away from her, and in a _ conversational speaking tone   see if she hears you. If not, go to 30 feet, then 20 feet, and so on _ you get a reply.\"\nThat evening, the wife was in the kitchen , and he was in the yard. He said to\nhimself,\"I'm about 40 feet away, and let me see what will happen.\" Then in a usual tone he asked,\"Honey, what's for dinner?\"\nNo _ .\nSo the husband moved closer to the kitchen, about 30 feet from his wife and\nasked,\"Honey, what's for dinner?\"\n _ no reply.\nNext he moved into the dining room where he was about 20 feet from his wife and _ , \"Honey, what's for dinner?\"\nAgain he got no reply. He walked up to the kitchen door, about 10 feet away. \"Honey,what's for dinner?\" Again there was no reply.\nSo he _ right up behind her. \"Honey, what's for dinner?\"\n\"Chicken! James, for the _ time I've said that.\"",
