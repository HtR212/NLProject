The merchant had a young son,who wanted to be a sailor ,so the captain took him for voyages in his  _  . One day when the captain had come from a voyage with a lot of money,the merchant told him that the price of iron had  _  and suggested that he should buy some with his money. \"I'll  _  it for you in my storehouse  _  you return from your next voyage,and perhaps you'll get  _  money.\" But while the captain was away,the price of iron went up very  _  ,so the merchant sold it and kept the money.When the captain came back,his  _  friend told him that he was very sorry and the mice had  _  all the iron. The captain knew that his friend was telling  a lie  ,but he stayed  _  and said,\"I knew that you had problems with mice in your storehouse.\" After a few days,the captain started  another  voyage,and when he returned home,he said to the merchant,\"I'm very sorry,but  _  our voyage a bird came down and carried your son away.\" The merchant was very  _  and said,\"Birds cannot carry boys!\" \"And  _  can mice eat iron,\" answered the captain.The merchant took the captain to a judge ,who said,\"The merchant must give the captain the money which he got when he  _  the iron,and then the captain must bring the merchant's son back to him. \"",
