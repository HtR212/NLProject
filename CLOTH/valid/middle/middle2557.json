    "article": "Mum's Christmas Surprise\nMolly ran back home from school and dropped her schoolbag on the sofa. Then on the table she saw \"Mum's Wish Book\" - a mail order catalog  from a gift shop. \"Mum,\" she said excitedly to herself, \"this year you'll get the gloves you want!\" Molly had walked a dog for a neighbor and saved her _ all year to buy Mum the gloves.\nShe opened \"Mum's Wish Book\" and hoped that she could find these _ in it. Teas ran down her face when she saw the gloves in the catalog. Mum wouldn't buy them for herself, because the family had a _ time on the farm. She once heard Mum say to Dad, \"Maybe some day, I'll have the money to get them.\"\nMolly ran out by the back door and went straight to the post office. There she carefully filled out the order form torn from the catalog.\n\"I need to buy a stamp to _ the form.\" She said to Mr. Smith, the only worker in the post office.\n\"Umm, a pair of gloves?\" said Mr. Smith, as he passed a stamp to her.\n\"Yes, It's a Christmas gift for Mum, but please don't tell her. It's our _ , OK?\" Molly didn't realize how white Mr. Smith's beard was until that moment. In face, he reminded her of Santa Claus.\nAs Molly walked back home, she decided to tell Dad her secret. \"You've got to check the mailbox every day,\" said Molly _ to Dad. He nodded, with a big smile.\nComing home from school every day, Molly peeked at   Dad when Mum wasn't _ , but every time he shook his head.\nOn Christmas Eve, Dad came back from mailbox, still empty handed. Molly felt _ when she went to bed, because she didn't have the gloves for Mum.\nBefore Christmas dinner, as Mum took the apple pies out of the oven, Molly began _ the table. Suddenly, they heard someone pulling up the driveway. From the window they saw Mr. Smith making his way to the door, with a box in his hand. Mr. Smith _ Mum the box, \"I believe this is yours.\"\nMum looked from Dad to Molly and opened the box. Her eyes lit up when she saw the gloves. \"Oh, who bought these for me?\" she asked.\n\"Santa did,\" said Molly smilingly.\n\"Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!\" Mr. Smith, with a loud laugh.\nIt was Christmas that no one would ever forget.",
