    "article": "Life in the future\nWhat will life be like in the future ? How will things change ? Here are some ideas. Which ones will come true ?\nIn the future, a change of weather won't mean a change of clothes. We'll  wear a new kind of clothes. They'll be warm when we're cold, and  _  when we're hot.\nThere'll be no more  _ rain and cold wind in spring. The weather will be quite warm or even hot all year,  _  heavy rain and wind.  The sea level  will rise as well.\nWe won't travel by bus  _ bike any more. Every family will have a small plane. No more expensive  _ --it'll be cheap to travel everywhere by plane, not only over land, but also over the sea or even into space. Maybe there'll be traffic jams in the air.\nDo you like long holidays? Well, you're going to like the future  because machines and robots will do all the heavy and difficult jobs, and we'll only do light and easy work.  Working hours  will be short so people will have long holidays.",
