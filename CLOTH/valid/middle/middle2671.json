Their clothes were not  _  , but they were clean. They were talking about the clowns and elephants excitedly. \"I want  _  tickets, eight for children and two for adults,\" said the father to the ticket lady. The ticket lady told him the  _  . When he heard that, the man couldn't believe his  _  . He asked again, \"How much?\" The ticket lady spoke again. The father looked sad. Clearly, he didn't have  _  money. My dad took a $20 bill and  _  it on the ground. Then he said to the man, \"Sir, this bill fell out of your pocket.\" The man knew  _  was going on. He looked into my dad's eyes and took the  _  . \"Thank you, thank you, sir. This  _  means a lot to me and my family.\" We didn't go to the circus that night, but we didn't feel sorry for it at all.",
