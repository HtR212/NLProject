    "article": "Rich or poor, young or old, we all have problems. We can easily become unhappy  _  we solve our problems.  _  about our problems can affect how we do things at school or at home. So how do we deal with our problems? Most of us have probably been angry  _  our friends, parents or teachers. Perhaps they said something you didn't like, or you felt they were unfair. Sometines, people can stay angry for years about a small problem. Time goes by, and good friendsships may  be lost  . When we're angry, however, we are usually the ones affected. Have you ever seen young children playing together? But they fight very soon, and decide not to talk to each other. However, this usually doesn't  _  for long. They become good friends again. This is an important  _  for us: we can solve a problem by learning to forget. Many students often complain about school. They might feel they have too much work to do sometimes, or think the rules are too  _  . We must learn how to change these \"problems\" into \"challenges\" . As young adults, it is our duty  to try  our best to deal with challenge with the help of our teachers. By comparing yourself to other people, you will find your problrms are not so  _  . Think about Stephen Hawking, for example, a very clever scientist. He can't walk or even speak, but he regards his many physical problems as unimportant. Now he is known  _  a great scientist in the world. We are probably quite healthy and smart. Let's not worry about our problems. Let's face the challenges instead.",
