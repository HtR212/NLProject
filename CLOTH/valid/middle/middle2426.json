    "article": "It was last June. I went into a supermarket to buy some vegetables, when a young man asked me, \"Can you tell me where the  _ counter is?\"\n\"Well, the milk is in the lower right corner,\" I replied. Picking up my things, I finally came to the milk counter where I met the same man. He was _ almost 10 bottles of milk in his hand. I asked, \"Do you need a  _ ?\" \"Sure, thank you.\" he answered.\nI was  _ he was still picking more bottles and after a few minutes his trolley had 24 bottles of milk. I laughed and asked, \"Why so many bottles?\" He smiled and said, \"These are _ my street dogs. Today I want to be a Santa for them.\"\nI said, \"Well, it's too  _ for you to be a Santa. It is still June and Christmas comes in  _ .\" He  _ at me for a second, but he left the counter without _ anything.\n _ , we met again at the bread counter. \"So these bread and cakes are also for the street dogs, Mr. Santa.\"  He smiled and said, \"Yes. These are also for the dogs and I love to be Mr. Santa in the month of June. Santa is a representation  of surprises and _ . We always hope Santa comes before Christmas . But in real life there is a Santa in each one of us. He is always ready to help us at any time, no matter  which month it is. Maybe when you offered a trolley to me, there was a Santa in you. When we  _  food to a poor man or a(n) _ to someone who is caught in the rain, we are being Santa there. So when you offer help to others or get help from others, just think that Santa has come all the way for you.\"\nHe left and I was _  that I met him. It was right to understand that Santa can come before Christmas. We just need to know that he is around us by giving happiness and love to others.",
