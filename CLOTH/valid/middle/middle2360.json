If you asked me a year ago if I could run early on a winter morning, I would laugh.  _  ,last fall I connected with a friend. She'd been running with a partner in the morning and had  _  forty pounds that year .I knew I could also have the same kind of weight loss. Since her running partner wasn't running, I asked if I could  _  her. The first two months were  _  ,because we ran twice a week at 5.15 a.m. My body wasn't used to the early hours and every run was difficult. Then it snowed and we took two months  _  . When the roads were clear, we soon were running together five days a week. As I'd changed the route of running, I discovered little  _  that made it even more worthy than a little weight loss. As we couldn't see other runners' faces, we said \"good morning\" to them  _  shining a flashlight .Running in the dark made us part of a club. When the sky was clear, I noticed lots of stars. It  _  me of summertime camping and I looked forward to running in warmer weather. Though I haven't taken off forty pounds yet, it's amazing how much more  _  I have and how much stronger I feel. Because of the morning run, the rest of the day is more productive than before,1 wouldn't say I've  _  a morning person, but l would say morning run is now my thing.",
