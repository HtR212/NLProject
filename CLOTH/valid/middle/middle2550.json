    "article": "Celebrate the Good Days\nIt was in April of what seemed to be a great year. I was in fourth grade with the greatest teacher, Miss De Rosear -- the coolest teacher.\nI had just come home from school to find Mom at home. That was _ because she never arrived home before me. Mom was sitting on the sofa with Dad. A thousand terrible things  started flashing through my mind. What if Grandma had passed away? I did not have the _ to say goodbye. What if my brother was hurt? As I crawled   up on the sofa next to Mom, she gave me a kiss and a huge smile, so I _ and went on with my normal after-school activities. During the TV show\nthat I always watched after school, Mom started getting phone calls. The calls continued for the rest of the night. Each time the _ rang, Mom rushed to her room. I then knew that something bad had happened.\nWhen Mom came back, I asked, --Mom, why do you keep on _ the room every time you get a phone call?\nShe turned to my sister and me and said, --Girls, I have something to tell you. I have cancer  .\nAs she said that I felt a sharp pain in my heart. I was thinking, --Why is God taking my mom from me so soon? What have I done?\nI didn't know that we were just beginning a very long, _ journey.\nThe next day on the bus I turned to my friend, Kate. --My mom...\nThat was all I could say before I started crying. Kate gave me a big hug and said _ , --I know, and I'm here for you.\nI knew that Kate would support me.\nDuring the summer, Mom stayed home. On the good days, sister and I talked about what we were going to do next day, week, month, or year with _ . We never talked about losing her.\nWe got _ from many different people. When school started again, Mom had to have surgery  . I stayed with one of my teachers, Mrs. Stephens. Mrs. Stephens made me rainbow French toast. She was always there for me with a smile, a\nhug, or --it will be okay advice.\nOn April 5, my mom became a five-year survivor  . When that day came, we had a big party. Friends came from far and wide to celebrate how _ Mom is and her success against cancer!\nThere will be good days and bad days -- some more bad than good. But as I have learned from my mother, celebrate the good days!",
