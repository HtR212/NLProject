    "article": "Have you ever offered a helping hand to those who are in trouble? One day, two  _  were walking along the road to school when they saw an old woman carrying a large basket of pears. They thought the woman looked very  _  . They went up to her and said, \"Are you going to town? If you are, we will help carry your basket.\" \"Thank you,\"  _  the woman, \"you are very kind. You see I'm weak and ill.\" Then she told them that she was now going to market to  _  the pears which grew on the only tree in her little garden. \"We are all going to the  _  .\" said the boys. \"Let us have the basket.\" And they took hold of it, one each side. They walked  _  with the heavy basket, but happily. The other day, I saw a little girl stop and  pick up  a piece of orange peel , which she threw into the dustbin , \"I wish  _  would throw that on the sidewalk,\" said she. \"Someone may step on it and fall.\" Perhaps some may say that these are not  _  things. That is right. But such a little thing shows that you have a thoughtful mind and a feeling heart. We must not wait for the  _  to do great things. We must begin with little things of love.",
