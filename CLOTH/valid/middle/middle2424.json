We have two apple trees in our backyard.Prana,our dog,loves  _  .When she goes outside,she usually grabs a dirty apple from the ground to eat later on.Prana knows that when she brings her treasure into the house,I am not always  _  ,so she tries to hide it from me.It is our little game. On the day that it snowed too  _  in the season,Prana went outside and I  _  her from the window.I noticed that she was  _  lots of holes and bringing out the apples buried beneath the snow.She seemed to be  _  to dig up as many apples as she could. But when she came back inside,she brought back only one.About five minutes later,I looked outside.The yard was completely  _  with birds.Prana had dug up all those apples for her bird friends to eat.She knew that they hadn't prepared  _  food for the early winter. This beautiful act of unconditional love from a(an)  _  taught me what real kindness was.",
