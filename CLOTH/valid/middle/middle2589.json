    "article": "When I was about 12 years old, I really wanted a new bike! I  _  my parents my birthday wish, but I knew there was little hope because my family could  _  have that money. On my birthday my parents told me they had my  _  outside in the back yard. At once, I  _  out to the yard. There was my bike,  _  it wasn't the bike that I thought it would be. This one was pink, old and worn with age. It was so  _  ! I thought I  _  my parents' feelings because I could see the disappointment  _  their faces and I was sure they could see it on mine. I  got on  the old bike and rode it, feeling  _  that I had made my parents feel this way. So I put on a smile, rode as fast as I could and didn' t  look back  . As time went by, I began to understand my parents gave me  _  much more than just a rusty old bike. They gave me a life lesson about  _  . When you give something out of love, it doesn' t matter what it is in fact. What matters is the love that is in it. I like to remember this  _  because giving a gift is not about money. It's about how much love you can feel from it. Do remember, a gift that  _  two dollars isn't any less valuable than one that costs one hundred dollars, or even more.",
