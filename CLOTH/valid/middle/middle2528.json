To begin with  , I didn't have to do anything. I just sat there, and my mother told me jokes and stories so I didn't get  _  .When I got older, I gave my mother a hand and I really enjoyed it. Then one year, my grandma gave me a book for Christmas. It was all about making candles and I loved it. I was 14, and I didn't have to go to the market  any more  because my mother could leave me at home on my own. I  _  my free time making candles of all shapes and sizes. I made  hundreds of  them. One day, my mother was ill, so I had to go to the market on my own. I decided to  _  some candles with me and see  _  I could sell them. They  were sold out  ) to make more candles. They were sold out really quickly, too. Ten months later, we decided  to stop to sell  flowers. My mother and I couldn't make enough candles during the week, so some of my friends started to help us. I paid them one pound  _  every candle, and we  used to  sell them for three or four times. It was fun and my friends worked with me in the market.
