    "article": "When I had something difficult to do, I used to ask my mum for help. But she always said, \"Do it  _  , dear.\" I would get so angry . I thought she was  the laziest  mother in the world! For example, one day, I decided  to invite  some friends to my home. My bedroom was very dirty. Books were all over the table and ground. I didn't make my bed. I asked my  _  to help me clean it. But she said seriously ,\"Do it yourself, girl.\" Because of my \"lazy mum\", I have to  _  my clothes and clean my room. I have to help my parents  do housework  . I even have to go to the dentist  _  . It is really hard to do everything on my own,  _  I have learned a lot. As time goes by, I understand my mother. It's her \"laziness\" that makes me clever and diligent . Just as my mum always says,\"A lady can't be lazy, or she'll be crazy.  _  can make you sunny !\"  What a  great mother! Don't you think so? A good mother is worth a hundred teachers!",
