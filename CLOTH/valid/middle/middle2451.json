    "article": "My husband and l were talking about possible colours because it was time for painting the kitchen again. The children, sat nearby and suddenly shouted, \"Not the measuring stick!\" The measuring stick isn't a real stick but the kitchen side of the door between our kitchen and the dining room. Along the edge we have  _  each child's growth by making a mark showing his or her  _  on every birthday. Over the ten years so many  _  pens, pencils and markers were used that the door came to be  _  like a painting. Names and dates  _  different hand-writing, and I can  _  by the script who measured whom. An eight-year-old brother measured his three-year-old sister, a grandchild measured her grandmother, my husband measured me. At parties, when this door swings, friends stop to  _  the names and dates. When we ask if they would like to leave their marks, they usually had a smile. Many of these listed on the door are still  _  While some have stopped. Some is still with us only in memory. When my mother came to see our eldest daughter graduating from university, we measured her, too. It was her last visit to our home. We haven't decided on the new kitchen colour plan yet, but one thing is  _  :Whether we paint the trim curry gold, Chowning's Tavern red or Federal blue, the back of the kitchen door will be always  _  with lots of names and dates in different colors.",
