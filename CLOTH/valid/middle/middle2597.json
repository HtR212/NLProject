    "article": "To my family and friends, As some of you know, I have just started my tour in the remote mountain area. Everything is going really well, so no  _  .The land is beautiful but unfortunately it has a lot of  _  too. I have received several emails asking what I need while I'm here .so I decided to write you all and let you know that I don't need anything. At least not for me. I'm asking all of you to send me a few  _  to help the local children. Let me explain. On 12 May 2009, in a small village here, 120 school age girls were  _  by a gas leak . Most have  _  but 6 are still in hospital. Even though the local government speaks about the  _  of education for both boys and girls but most of these kids only attend school for four hours a day if they are even allowed to go. They are so excited and  _  to learn, but then have to  _  things like being sprayed with acid or poisoned. Most of these kids are poor and can't  _  a pencil, pen or even paper to write on. So my co-workers and I are planning a trip to several schools to promote  _  and to give these kids some of the  _  they need. That is where all of you come in. If you can, please  send over  whatever school supplies you currently have  _  . That would be a huge help. I know how busy you are so thank you for taking the  _  to do this and I will post pictures of this  _  after we go. Thank you again. Todd Tucker",
