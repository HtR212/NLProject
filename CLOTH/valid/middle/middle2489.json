    "article": "Life in the year 3044 is very different  _  life in the 21 century. We still do many of the things you did, but we do them  _  . For example, we now have e-friends to help us and keep us company. An e-friend is a machine that looks just  _  a human being. It can walk and talk and can do almost  _  we human beings do. My e-friend is a lot like me and we have  a lot of  fun together. She helps me  _  my homework and we often go swimming. She is programmed to take care of me if anything  happens  , so I always feel safe when we are together. She can also send me messages, just like old-fashioned e-mail, and I can download information from her memory. It's great  to have  an e-friend. I am never lonely and I always have someone to talk  _  . I would like to tell you more about life in the year 3044, but I have to send my e-friend to clean up my room. Maybe  one day  I will be able to travel back in time and visit you.",
