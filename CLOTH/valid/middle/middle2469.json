    "article": "A young man was about to finish school. For a long time he had  _  to get a beautiful sports car. He knew his father could well  _  it, so he told him that a sports car was all he wanted. Then on the morning of his graduation ,he was called to his father's room. His father told him how  _  he was to have such a fine son, and told him how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautiful gift box.  _  , the young man opened the box and found a lovely Bible with his name on it. Angrily, he raised his  _  to his father and said, \"With all your money you give me a Bible? \" He then rushed out of the house, leaving the Bible. Many years passed and the young man was very  _  in business, and had a beautiful home and a wonderful family.  _  that his father was very old, he thought perhaps he should go to see him. He had not seen him  _  that graduation day. Before he could go, he received a phone telling him that his father had died. He had to go home immediately and take care of the things that his father left him. When he began to search through his father's important papers, he saw the still new Bible,  _  as he had left it years ago. He opened the Bible and began to turn the pages. As he was reading, a car key with a tag dropped from the back of the Bible. On the tag was the  _  of his graduation, and the words \"PAID IN FULL\". Sadness and regret filled his heart.",
