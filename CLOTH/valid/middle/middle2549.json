I think having dreams or hopes about the future will help us do better at school. As middle school students, it's time for us to  think about  what we want to be in the future. If we know it better, we will know  _  to do it better at school. For example, if you are outgoing and like to meet people, you can be a  _  in the future. Then you should practice  writing  more articles. If you're happy with children and like  _  , you can teach English as a job in the future. And then you are supposed to work harder at English. If you want to  _  many interesting places, you can be a tour guide. Of course, all the  _  that we are learning at school will be useful in the future, so we should work hard at all of them.",
