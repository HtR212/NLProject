You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce   back.\nBut the other four balls, family, health, friends and spirit, are made of _ . If you drop one of these, they will be broken. They will never be the same. You must understand that and try to have balance in your life.  _ ?\nDon't look down on your worth by comparing  _  with others. It is  _  we are different and each of us is special.\nDon't let other people set goals for you.  _  you know what is best for yourself.\nDon't give up when you still have something to give. Nothing is really over  until  the moment you stop trying.\nDon't be afraid of difficulties. It is by taking chances that we learn how to be  _ .\nDon't shut love out of your life by saying it's  _ .
