And there was already  _  work to do: giving the pets food andwater, and even giving them kisses  _  the heads.  _  , they looked at me with frightened eyes. A doctor would say to them, \"Don't worry.  _  will be OK.\" Some animals were  _  for the doctor to check them. I washed a dog's hurt leg. I worked  _  to make sure I didn't hurt him. I wished he  could  know we were just trying to help him. It was a  _  day and the work made me tired, but I was very happy. I knew I loved animals. And the animals knew I loved them. They  _  my care with love!",
