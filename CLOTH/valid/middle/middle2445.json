    "article": "The students of seventh grade walked into the hall with laughter and voices. We were told to listen to a speech by Mrs. Marks about bullying  and peer pressure  . During the whole year, our grade had listened to speeches on these topics over and over again. My friends and I sat back, preparing to sit through another _ speech.\nBut as soon as Mrs. Marks started talking, she caught my attention. She talked in the way as if she knew how to reach into our minds and make us _ . And for once, I actually began to think about what she was talking about.\nOne boy, especially, came to my mind. Every day, this boy came to school late. The students in the class would always make fun of him. They said, \"Hey, man! Where have you been?\" And then another added a more unfriendly joke. Their jokes would continue until the teacher _ them to stop. But it was always too late. The boy would put his head down on his desk in _ .\nI felt really sorry for this _ boy. Then I turned my attention back to the speaker and listened carefully till the end.\n\"Now, before I leave today, I would like to give everyone here an opportunity to say something on the subjects of bullying or peer pressure. You may apologize  to or thank someone. And I can promise that no one will _ at you this time.\nThe silence in the room made me believe her. Slowly I saw a few hands rise. One girl wanted to apologize to a friend, and another thanked a boy for his kindness. It was then that my moment of _ happened. The speaker called on me, and I began to talk.\n\"What you said today _ makes sense. I know that it's true, because I see it every day in class. There is one person who is always made fun of.\" My voice shook, I think that everyone here has made fun of him. I know I have. And now I really _  it. To us, it may just be a game, but to him, it must hurt. And I think well, I think we need to stop.\"\nThere was a silence for several seconds, but then, clapping quickly spread through the crowd.\nLater that day, the boy thanked me. And from then on, the other students began to _ him better. They stopped playing jokes on him and greeted him with a friendly \"Hi\". I was pleased I had voiced something that everyone was feeling.",
