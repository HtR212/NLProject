    "article": "During my second year of nursing school, our teacher gave us a quiz . I was a hardworking student and I did well  _  all the subjects. I finished the questions successfully until I read the last one, \"What is the first name of the  _  who cleans the school?\" I saw the cleaning woman every day. She is short and about 60 years old. She has dark hair. But  _  would I know her name? I have  _  talked with her before. In fact, I've never even thought about talking to her! I stared at my paper and started to feel rather guilty . Finally, I handed in my paper  _  writing the answer to the last question. Before the class ended, one student  _  the teacher if the last question would count into our grade. \"In your life,\" the teacher said, \"you will meet many people. All are  _  . They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is just smiling and saying hello.\" I'll never  _  that lesson. Everyone deserves our attention and we should try to get to know all the people who work and live around us. That was the most important  _  of my life. Later that day, I  _  that the cleaning woman's name was Dorothy.",
