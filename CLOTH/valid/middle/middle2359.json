    "article": "About a year ago, a couple with 3 children moved into the apartment next door to me. I never heard any noise from the children, but the parents were always shouting at them, in a frightening way. We met often in the hallway when we were coming or going. I always spoke, but the only _ I ever got was a hello from the 4-year-old girl.\nI usually go out for breakfast and one day when I returned ,they were just coming from their apartment and the little girl was holding the door open for others. I stayed in the car doing unnecessary things as I wasn't in a _ . The parents were telling her to get into the car immediately. I looked up and saw the little girl was still holding the door open, waiting for me .\nAs a disabled man, I can't hurry at _ , but I hurried as much as I could and thanked her. She was smiling like a lovely angel. I was so _ by her small act of kindness. That afternoon I was shopping and I saw a white bear. I thought of the _ and said to myself. \"I believe she would like that\" so I bought it.\nThe next day there was a knock on the door and it was the little girl and her parents. She was so _ of her bear and thanked me as if I had never been thanked before. The mother and father _ thanked me.\nNow when we meet in the hall we all speak, and in a friendly manner I might add. As time passes, I don't hear that shouting as often. . In fact , hardly at all.\nLast night we had about four inches of _ . I looked out at my car and wondered _ I was going to keep my doctor's appointment .\nWhen I opened the outside door, there was my car with all the snow cleaned. I can't express how I felt at that moment. The man next door was the only person I knew in the whole building, _ when I saw him the next day, I asked him if he was the good man that cleaned my snow. He said No . He wanted to but his wife said she wanted to do it.\nIsn't it amazing that a 4-year-old girl can change so many things for the better? My guardian angel  says that good things usually come from small acts .",
