They say these things are cheap, _ I don't agree with them.Waste can bring a lot of problems. Though China is rich in some resources  , we are _ of others. It is reported that we will have no coal or oil to _  in 100 years. So if we go on wasting our resources,  _ can we use in the future and where can we move? Think about it.
