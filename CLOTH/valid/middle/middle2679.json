    "article": "Is money everything? At present some people think that  _  is everything. Some of them even  _  their lives for it. Money has its most useful  _  on the poor, but once a person has a rich life, a lot more money doesn't mean more  _  If money was  _  , all millionaires would have true love, true friendship, good health and a long life.  _  , this is not always true. Nothing else is more  _  than the three words \"I love you\". But can  _  be bought?I'm afraid not. Love means to give, not to take. To every person, health and long life are  _  the most valuable things. Well, can health and a long life be bought with money? The answer is \"No\". Of all the longest living people in the world,  _  of them are millionaires. True friendship can't be bought  _  Many other things  _  be bought with money: knowledge, life and happiness and so on. Just think, if a person  doesn't have  these things at all, is the money still useful? No matter how much money you have, it is still not enough  to make  you a happy person if you have no one to laugh  _  , no one to cry for. Now, do you think money is everything?",
