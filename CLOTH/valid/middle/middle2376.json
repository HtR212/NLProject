    "article": "Jack is my best friend. We've been friends for 10 years. We were both born in 1991, so we are at the same  _  . We both study at a school  named  Taizhou Middle School. Jack is an easy-going person and he often makes friends  _  without too much trouble. Jack and I often share our own secrets between us, so we are  _  to each other.When I feel worried or unhappy, I can always go to him. A famous saying goes like this: \" A friend in  _  is a friend indeed.\" In some way, bad things always test our friendship. If someone is really your lifelong friend, then he or she will give us enough  _  and necessary help. Do you agree? Every day, after class, we often go to the school library. There're tens of thousands of books and magazines. The school library  offers  good service , for example the air-conditioner is always on and  _  drinks are always ready to give you freshness . Rich people always donate large sums of money to support the library. Everybody is happy about it. During the Reading Week, we always invite our friends to  discuss  interesting books. Every year, we have two long holidays. When we're on  holiday  , we usually go to different places together. In a word, it's lucky to have such a friend sharing interesting things together.",
