    "article": "\"I love you\" might be one of the most important combinations of three words in the English language. It's the _ that a romantic relationship is serious. Besides, it also shows the closeness for parents, children or the ones who you love.\nIn Putonghua, \"I love you\" _ as \"Wo ai ni\", but the way it's used in China might be a little different, and most Chinese people are wondering _ .\nThe Global Times reports that some online videos showing children telling their parents \"I love you\" have become _ in China. One of them, filmed by an Anhui TV station, shows a number of college students telling their parents they love them. \"Are you drunk?\" asked a parent. In another _ video, shot by a Shanxi TV station, the parents' responses   are still mixed. For example, a father responded _ bluntly   -- \"I am going to a meeting, so much for that.\"\nWhy don't Chinese families use those words? \"The parents' responses show that many Chinese are not good at _ their feelings like that,\" Xia Xueluan, a sociologist from Peking University, told the Global Times, \"They are used to educating children with negative   language.\"\nStill, that doesn't _ that love can't be shown. In another article, Zhao Mengmeng, a 31-year-old woman, said she had never told her father she loved him face-to-face _ she found it a bit strange. Sometimes actions speak louder than words. However, Zhao gave her father a photo album recording photographs of them together on every one of her birthdays. The pictures were _ on the Internet later, being forwarded   hundreds of thousands of times on Weibo.",
