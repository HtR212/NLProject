I practiced secretly, learning from books, movies, and shows. However, without my parents' support, that dream seemed impossible to reach.\nOne summer, my little sister Maggie was going to dance lessons. I quickly asked  _  parents to allow me to take her to the lessons. What a  _  chance to learn dancing!\nOne afternoon, I was practicing a new dance in my room, when Maggie walked  _ . \"What's the matter, Maggie?\" I stopped  _ .\n\"Dennis, you are a great dancer! Can you help me?\"\n\"What is it?\" I wondered.\n\"There'll be a dancing performance in my school,  _  all the boys think I'm slow, and  _  of them wants to be my partner. Could you dance with me for it?\" She looked at me hopefully.\n\"You can be a good dancer!\" I encouraged her. \"Let's show those people that they have been  _  all along.\"\nIn the following months, we  _  every evening, hiding from my parents. I was having a fantastic time and _  Maggie improved a lot.\nFinally came the big day. I became  _  when I heard my parents would come to watch the performance. As the  _  began, I took a deep breath and tried to calm down. We moved perfectly, shining with pride. From the cheering of the crowd, I was sure we had  _ .  My heart was beating wildly when I saw my _  coming towards me. He put his hand on my shoulder. \"Well done, Son. Though it is hard for me to admit  it, it seemed that you really  belonged to  this stage . Go for it and make us proud.\"\nI'd been waiting for this moment for so long. I knew that the road ahead wasn't going to be easy, but I wouldn't give up. I wanted nothing more in life than to dance.",
