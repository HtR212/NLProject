Jack walked down the street. He didn't see a letter box on the street. But he really  _  a basket with a sign on it. The sign said, \"PUT LITTER IN THIS BASKET\". \"I can read,\" thought Jack, but he couldn't  _  the word \"letter\" right. Jack dropped the letter in the basket. Then he ran  _  to tell his mother about the basket. \"Oh, no, child!\" said his mother, \"You put the letter in a basket. That litter basket is  _  old paper and other useless things.\" \"Oh,\"said Jack,\"does the  _  on the basket mean that?\" \"Yes, it does,\"said his mother,\"The word is'litter'not'letter'. Now get the letter and post it.\" When Jack got there, a man was putting the old  _  in a truck. \"Stop!\"shouted Jack, and he began to tell the man about the letter. The man helped him to look for the letter. After a while they  _  it. Then Jack put the  _  in the letter box. He said,\"  _  don't they tell us all the words when we first go to school? Then things like that can't happen.\"",
