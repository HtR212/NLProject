    "article": "Everyone needs friends. There is an old saying, \"Friends are God's way of taking care of us.\" But how do you  find  real friendship and keep it? The American writer Sally Seamans tells young students some smart  _  to find friends. Sally says finding friendship is  just like  planting a tree. You plant the seed and  take care of  it to make it grow. First, you should choose a friend. What makes a good friend? It is not because a person has money or good looks. A good friend should be  _  and patient. For example, if  _  have a bad day, a good friend should listen to your complaints and do his or her best to help. To make a friend, you cannot be  too  shy. You should make each other happy and share your lives. But things cannot always be happy. Even the best friends have fights. What should you do  _  you have a fight with your friend? You have to talk to him or her. When there is no one around, have an honest talk. If he or she doesn't want to talk, you could write a letter. There are three steps to make you  _  friends again: Tell him or her how you are feeling; say what your friend has done wrong, and explain why you did this or that. Remember that friendship is the  most  important thing in your life.",
