He told the  _  to plant a sapling each person in front of the house. The father said, \"Whose sapling grows best, I will buy him or her a favorite  _ .\"  When the boy saw his brothers and sisters watering the trees, however, he had a strange idea: he hoped that the tree he planted would  _ soon. So, after watering it once or twice, he would never  look after  it.\nA few days later, when the little boy went to see his tree again, he was  _  to find that it didn't fade   but grew some fresh leaves. Compared with the trees of his brothers and sisters, his tree was even greener.His father kept his  _ , bought the little boy his favorite gift and said that from the tree his son planted, he was  _  that his son would become an excellent botanist   when he grew up.\nSince then, the little boy slowly became optimistic  .
