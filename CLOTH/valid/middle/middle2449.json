All  _  rules are okay because they're reasonable . But there are some rules Selina  _  agree with. For example, at her school they have to wear a uniform and they can't wear jeans. But she thinks jeans are  _  because they're comfortable. In school, they can't listen to music in art class. Selina doesn't agree with this rule. She thinks  listening to  music in art crass is okay. Selina  _  has to follow some rules at home. For example,  _  she wants towatch TV, she has to finish her homework first. And she can't go out with her friends  _  school nights, that is, from Monday to Friday, she also has to clean her room  _  week. Luckily, she doesn't have to take out the trash . She hates it.",
