    "article": "A Thanksgiving Day article printed in a newspaper told of a school teacher who asked her class of first graders to draw a picture of something they were _ for. She thought of how little these children from poor neighborhoods really had to be thankful for. _ she knew that most of them would draw pictures of turkeys  or tables with food. The teacher was _ to see the picture Douglas handed in... a _ hildishly  drawn hand.\nBut whose hand? The class was greatly interested in the abstract  image. \"I think it must be the hand of God that brings us food,\" said one child. \"A farmer,\" said another, \"because he _ the turkeys.\" _ when the others were at work, the teacher came over to Douglas's desk and asked whose hand it was. \"It's your hand, Teacher.\" he _ .\nShe remembered that very often at break time she had taken Douglas, a short _ child by the hand. She often did that with the children. But it _ so much to Douglas. Perhaps this was everyone's Thanksgiving, not for the material things given to us but for the _ , in whatever small way, to give to others.",
