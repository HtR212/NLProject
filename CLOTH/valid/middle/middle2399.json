    "article": "No One Words But My Own\nThe classroom was full of those of us who wanted to work on the school newspaper. I didn't write a lot. but working on the paper sounded like fun. I _ the idea of being a reporter, interviewing my friends, and covering middle school events.\nTo be chosen, we had to turn in an example of our _ . I wrote an article about the joys of summer, and showed it to my father, a talent poet. He read it and frowned .\n\"It's okay.\" my father said, taking out a pencil \"But how about changing this sentence to ...\" And as a result, he rewrote the whole piece -- without me, for I never said anything to _ him.\nNo surprise--his version was _ . He had a gift for language. It was so much better than my piece that I turned in his version instead of mine.\n\"Welcome to the Dundee School News,\" my teacher said to me.

I was unable to write at that level, but I couldn't tell the _ to the teacher, and I couldn't ask my father for help, either. That term working on the paper was really painful. And my teacher clearly expressed his _ .\n\"Can't you write something more like the first piece you wrote?\"he said, each time I turned in my article.\nI couldn't, because at that age, I didn't have my father's ability and experience as a writer.

I _ that my father rewrote my first article himself, instead of simply trying to help me to improve it. But in my heart I knew it was my fault  because I allowed him to do it. Later, I did become a successful writer on my own. Looking back, I realized that the pain and shame of that school experience had a _ side. It taught me to depend on myself and be myself. So every day, I try to use my own words, find my own style and be my own best self. It feels great.",
