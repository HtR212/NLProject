But not just any pen. It's a lucky pen!\" He handed me the pen _ , waiting for my reaction .\nI looked at the pen in my hand. There was nothing _ about it. It looked just like any other ballpoint pen. I had a drawer full of them. At that moment, I didn't realize how special it was or how much I would come to treasure  it.\nI had made the decision to be a(n) _ . I had dreamed about it for a long time but I was afraid of being refused by the publishing houses. The night before, I told my husband my _ when I thought Cody wasn't listening. \"What if _ likes my writing and I fail?\" But Cody did _  what I said. Now he stood in front of me, watching me examine the pen. \"You don't have to be afraid now,\" he said. \"This pen will make your  _ great and everyone will love you.\"\nTears filled my eyes. Refusal  and failure didn't seem like such a big problem any more. Even if I _ sold the first book, I had everything I could ever need. I knew that pen would bring me luck, though. And I felt _ already, just by having Cody in my life, especially when I heard what he did to get it.\nIn the lunchroom, Cody heard an older boy talking about having a lucky _ . He decided to get it for me. The boy was a tough negotiator  but Cody didn't  give up . In the end, he _ his favorite Matchbox car, two army men his brother gave him, a crayon, and a piece of candy-his most important things, for that pen. Just to make _  feel better.\nI still have that pen, though it's long out of ink, in a cup on my desk. When a refusal letter arrives and I start feeling _ , I look at it and remember just how lucky I am. For while I value that pen, it's Cody who I really  _  in my life.",
