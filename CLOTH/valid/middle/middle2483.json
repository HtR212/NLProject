Most of the stars are much  _  than the moon, but they look smaller  _  they are far away from the earth. At night, the moon is high in the sky  like  a light. But the moon has  _  light of its own. The light of the moon comes from the sun. The sun gives us light, heat and life. And the plants, animals and men will die  _  the sun. The earth goes around itself  all the time  . When the part of the earth  _  to the sun, it is day. The  _  part of the earth is night. The earth is our homeland. We should love it.",
