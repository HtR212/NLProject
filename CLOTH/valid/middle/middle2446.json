Finally, they grew up and 2  _  to swim deeper and further. One morning, the three fish were 3  _  to a shallow water by a big wave. A small boat was taken there, too. It was hard for the fish to go back to the sea because the boat was right in front of them. The largest fish realized that they were 4  in danger  and said they had to find a way to leave there as fast as possible. The second largest fish 5  _  with his elder brother, but the youngest one did not. He said that there was much 6  _  for their activities, so he would not worry at all and still swam around 7  _  .
