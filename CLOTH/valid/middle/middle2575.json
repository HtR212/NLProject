    "article": "Dad never tried to hug or kiss me when I was a child. And of course, he never said \"I love you\"to me,  _  . Maybe it's a Chinese cultural thing, or maybe that's the way my dad was. But whenever I felt  _  , defeated or lonely, dad was always there. Dad was a man of  few  words, but I always liked to talk to him, and I could always feel a very special connection to him. When I was in high school, dad retired and had a  _  stand on the street near my school. Dad was very good at making fried noodles, and a lot of people liked his noodles. Every day when I finished school, my classmates and I would pass his food stand. But I really  _  talking to dad in front of his food stand,  _  I did not want my classmates to know that my dad was selling noodles on the street! One night, I couldn't  _  it any more and shouted, \"Dad, could you stop selling your stupid noodles? I don't need a father who sells noodles on the street!\" At that moment, dad was shocked. He tried to say  _  but didn't. When he  _  his head away, something happened that I had never seen and would never forget  _  the rest of my life. His eyes were filled with tears and sadness. It was the first time that I saw dad  _  . My mom later told me that dad was selling noodles to save money for my college education. I was such a fool, and even today I still feel  _  for that night. Time really flies. I finished college and then left my home city. For the past ten years, whenever I've visited home, dad was always there meeting me and seeing me off  _  at the railway station. Whenever mom was calling me, dad would sit  _  her with a list of questions. He would ask mom to talk to me for him. That's the way dad is, and that's  _  dad shows his love to me. Dad is still quiet, but I still feel a connection. --\"a silent father's love.\"",
