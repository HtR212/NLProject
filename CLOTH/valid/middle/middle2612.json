    "article": "One day, while I was  _  on the street, I heard the piano music and singing rising above the noise of the people. I walked more slowly to  find out  where it was coming from. Then I saw a young lady sitting at a piano. She was singing songs about love, 'Believing yourself and keeping on trying'. The way she was singing made me a little comfortable. I stood there  _ , watching her playing on such a crowded New York square. I thought that she must be  _  enough to perform in front of so many people.\nShe noticed me. I walked over and told her how good her _  sounded.\"Thank you.\"she said.\n\"I have been going through a hard time recently,  _  you've made me hopeful again.\" I said to her.\n\"I'm glad that I could help,\"she replied,\"Why are you so sad ?\"\n\"Well, my mom has lost her job, and I'm not sure what to do.\"\n\"Did you notice the  _  you were walking? Your head was down.\"she said. \"Don't be upset, because _  comes in different ways and if your head is down, you might not see it. You should smile more, and lift your head up.\"\nI looked at her, amazed at how she was encouraging me.\" _  are you playing the piano here?\"I asked her with a smile.\nShe  _  that she saw a lot of unhappy people like me around and she tried to cheer us up by playing music.\nI smiled a little wilder, realizing that no difficulties could stop me from going on.",
