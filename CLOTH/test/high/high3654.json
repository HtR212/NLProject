    "article": "I grew up in a tiny Baltimore row house in a faraway mountain area. My parents  _  the necessities of life but they couldn't give much more. If I asked my father for a pair of jeans, he would say, \" If you want them, make the money and buy them yourself.\" He wasn't being mean; he just couldn't  _  them. From age 12 on, I did part-time jobs after school. When I  _  from high school, I joined the navy. Soon I was in a boot camp at Parris Island, S.C., where I learned that life in the navy centered around completing daily  _  . These could be anything from cleaning the camp to conducting mock battles. Completing these tasks successfully  _  discipline, team-work and responsibility. It didn't  _  whether you were black, white or Asian; everyone worked together for the  _  of the company. I went on to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academic and later became an officer in the navy. The part of my job I  _  most was the consulting meetings I  _  with the family members of the men and women in my  _  , trying to help them deal with the long periods of  _  . These proved popular and word of them spread. Before long I was being asked to give encouraging  _  to business groups, educators and kids across the country. But I consider the boot camp my first real  _  , and my life is still guided by the  _  lessons I learned there. It taught me discipline, friendship and the pride related to setting a task every day and working hard to  _  it.",
