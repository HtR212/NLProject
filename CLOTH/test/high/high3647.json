    "article": "Being content with yourself and optimistic about your future is not difficult. Whatever is in the past is  _  . Learn from it and move on. When you are enough  _  to do this, you will see that moving ahead is the best definition of  _  . What can you do now? Sure it is  _  for me to tell you to forget the past,  _  it is a whole different  _  to actually do it. Life is a complex set of events much of which  of course  is real, but a large amount is just your  _  of what really happened. Let me  _  with an example. I know not everyone is a football fan, but I am  _  most have watched at least  _  of a game on TV. Most games and almost all the important games are  _  over and over on the TV screen right after the game happened. When you watched a game, you were  _  of the outcome, saying the player  _  the ball. Then while watching the instant replay, you realized you were  _  wrong. The player dropped the pass. What you were certain of never happened. In order to  _  on your future, you should try to minimize the effects of your past. Try to find out how much of the past that you are certain are just  _  . For example, as a teenager, you tried to build a piece of furniture in your father's workshop. The piece of furniture looked  _  when you finished, but it fell apart before you could  _  it to your father. The reality was that the wood you used was faulty. It was not your building ability. So don't think yourself to be a  _  carpenter and avoid building anything. Forget the past and move on.",
