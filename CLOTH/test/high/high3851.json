Suddenly I hit upon an idea. \"Wouldn't it be fun to go  _  ? Others go in winter, but why couldn't we?  _  , we could be healthier if we did. \" I told them about this, and they all said it was a good idea  _  .

But it was very cold all the same.  _  our heavy overcoats were not enough to keep us warm. We all felt we should go back, but no one wanted to speak out. We soon reached the sands.

But things were not going so  _  . The freezing sea wind was blowing. We felt very cold and trembled all over. At  _  we made up our minds to go into the water.

I gave the  _  , and we all rushed forward and jumped in. I shall never forget the moment I was in the water. I was up  _  and rushed again to the shore.  _  it was with my friends. We put on our clothes as quickly as possible. On the way back home, we talked about this unforgettable  _  . The four of us did not  _  school for the following three days. We all suffered a lot  _  a very bad cold. But we thought it was all worth it.",
