When she got to the platform,Rose felt weak and tired--maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before,she thought.She rested herself  _  a post close to the tracks. Several yards away,Frank,43 and his girlfriend, Jennifer found a spot close to  _  the front of the train would stop. They were deep in  _  about a house they were thinking of buying. But when he heard the scream,  _  by someone yelling,\"Oh,my God,she fell in!\" Frank didn't hesitate.He  _  down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. \"No! Not you!\" his girlfriend  _  after him. She was  _  to be alarmed.By the time Frank reached Rose,he could feel the tracks  _  and see the light coming. The train was about 20  _  from the station. It was  _  to lift her.She was just out.But he managed to raise her four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the grip and  _  her away from the edge.That was where Rose briefly regained  _  ,felt herself being pulled along the ground, and someone else holding her  _  .Rose thought she'd been robbed.A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help  _  the blood pouring from her head.  _  she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in. Police and fire officials  _  arrived,and Frank told what had happened.Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40-minute train ride downtown---just as he had been seconds after the  _  which made her think about her  _  at the time.\"I saw the train coming and 1 was thinking he was going to die,\"she explained.",
