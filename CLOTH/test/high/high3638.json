    "article": "Once upon a time there lived a poor man named Malcolm who hunted for his food. One warm spring day, Malcolm had been  _  for many hours, and he was hot and tired and hungry. He hadn't  _  even a mouse. When he came upon a big tree, he sat down under its  _  to rest. Suddenly he found a big ostrich egg beside the tree. He  picked up  the egg and carried it back to his hut . The egg was so white and round, pure and beautiful that he couldn't  _  eating it. So he put the egg on the table and went to sleep. The next morning when he woke up, he was  _  to find bread and soup on his table. He was so hungry, so he tore off a piece and ate it. \"I've never  _  anything so delicious,\" he said aloud. Then he heard a voice answer, \"It's bread and soup I've made for you.\" He turned to find a beautiful woman standing beside the ostrich egg,  _  was cracked wide open. \"Malcolm, you are a kind and generous man, and I will make you  _  for the rest of your life.  _  me and I will always make delicious food for you.\" \"How can this be? An ostrich egg's  _  cannot speak or cook or marry me,\" he said. \"I will make you happy, Malcolm,\" she said, \"You must  _  only this: you will never call me the daughter of an ostrich egg.\" \"I promise,\" Malcolm said. And so they got married. For many years they lived  _  great happiness. His wife brought him  _  , goats and made him a chief. But one day, Malcolm got so  _  that he was not  _  with what he had. He quarreled with his  _  . He said his wife was the daughter of an ostrich egg... And  in a flash  he was alone again, living in his hut,  _  his old clothes. There were no cattle, no goats and no wife. He understood that he had been  _  to let greed and anger get the better of him and to break his promise to his wife.",
