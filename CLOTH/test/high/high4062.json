    "article": "A young girl, Hattie, stood outside a small church from where she had been turned away because it was too crowded. A kind pastor carried her   _   and found a place for her to sit in the back. He also told\nher they could build a   _   Sunday school by raising money.\nThe pastor didn't see   _   again until he heard from her parents some two years later. Hattie had sadly died and her parents called for the kind-hearted pastor, who had treated their daughter   _  , to handle the final arrangements. As her poor little body was   _  , a worn and wrinkled purse appeared in front of them. Inside was found 57 cents and   a note  , reading \"This is to help to build the little church bigger   so that   more children can go to Sunday school.\"\nFor two years she had saved for this offering of   _  . When the pastor   _   read that note, he knew immediately what he would do.   _   this note and the cracked, red pocketbook to the pulpit, he   _   the story of her unselfish love and devotion.He challenged his deacons   to get busy and raise enough money for the larger building.   _   the story doesn't end there!\nA newspaper learned of the story and   _   it.It was   _   by a rich man who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands.When told that the church couldn't pay so   _  , he offered it for a(n)   _  payment.\nChurch members made large donations.Checks   _   from far and wide.Within five years the little girl's   _   had increased to $250,000.00,Her unselfish love had paid large shares.\nWhen you visit Philadelphia, look up Temple Baptist Church, with a   _   capacity of 3,300.In one room may be seen the   _   of the sweet face of the little girl, whose 57 cents made such remarkable history.",
