    "article": "The Johnson family from England believe they are lucky to be alive after surviving an incredible incident off the coast of Australia. The Johnsons had been  _  that they might see some whales when they were  _  a yacht--a large expensive boat for a 10-day sailing  _  around the Whitsunday Islands.  _  , they had no clue just how  _  their viewing would be. Two hours into their journey a nine-meter-long humpback whale  _  out of the ocean and crashed into their boat before returning to the water. Mark Johnson,the eldest son,was sailing the yacht when he heard an immense bang and a thud . He  _  thought the yacht had hit a rock. But when he looked up, he saw the whale  _  down the deck of the boat. He told the reporters, \"We were staring into its right eye. It was a very  _  moment. The eye was about the  _  of a dinner plate. It was huge!\"  _  for the Johnson family, no one was hurt, but the yacht suffered  _  damage. The whale had ruined the mast and rigging--the pole and ropes which hold the  _  --and so the family was left with no way at sea, 10 miles from the shore. The  _  equipment was also damaged, but fortunately they had a cell phone and were able to call for help. Why the whale jumped onto the yacht is a  _  ,but the family thinks that maybe the boat had not  _  sailed between the whale and its baby calf. Perhaps the whale was trying to  _  its calf when it jumped, and hit the yacht by accident.  _  the reason, people are completely  _  that this incident happened. There is over 135 million square miles of ocean, so what are the  _  of a whale jumping onto a 30-foot-long yacht? The possibility of something like this happening is extremely small, but it just shows that life is full of surprises.",
