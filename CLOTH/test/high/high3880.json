    "article": "Ricardo Semler became boss of his father's business Semco in Brazil at the age of 21. Ricardo worked like a(an)   _   man, from 7:30 am to midnight every day. One afternoon, while he was visiting a factory in New York, he   fell down  . The doctor told him if he   _   like that, he would find a new home in hospital. Semler got the   _  . He changed the way he   _  . In fact, he changed the ways his   _   worked, too.\nHe let his workers take more   _   so that they would be the ones worrying when things went wrong. He   _   them to set their own salaries,49 _  their own working hours and he cut all the jobs he thought were   _  , like receptionists and secretaries. \nHe changed the office:51 instead of  walls, they have plants at Semco, so bosses can't   _   themselves away from everyone else. And the workers are   _   to decorate their workspace as they want.    \nIt sounds perfect,but does it   _  ? The answer is in the   _  :in the last six years, Semco's revenues have   _   from $35 million to $212 million. The company has gone from eight hundred employees to 3,000. Why?\nSemler says it's because of \"peer pressure\" which makes employees work   _   for everyone else. If someone isn't doing his job   _  , the other workers will not allow the   _   to continue. In other words,Ricardo treats his workers like adults rather than children, and expects them to act like responsible   _  . And they do.",
