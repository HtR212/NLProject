They loved our sweet songs we sang and the flowers we gave them.\nAs we were   _   on the third floor for old people with Alzheimer  , most of them   _   off at the walls or floor. However, one lady   _   my eye. She was singing songs to herself. They weren't the songs that we were singing, at least they didn't   _   like that. As we got   _   with each song, she did as well. The louder we got, the louder she got.   _   she was singing, she was also   _   out to us with her hands and body. I knew that I should have gone over to her, but I thought that my   _   were to my students. People who worked at the care center could   _   to her, I thought.\nJust when I stopped feeling   _   about not giving her the attention she needed, one of my students, Justin, also   _   the same lady. The difference between us is that he   _   on her needs, but I didn't. Justin looked this aged lady in her   _   and said, \"You're important, and I will take my   _   to let you know that.\" This elderly lady stopped singing and held his hand. Tears felt down her face. No   _   can completely describe that touching moment.\nIt took a boy to   _   me about kindness and love. Justin's example of a complete, selfless attitude toward another was a   _   that I'll never forget. He was the teacher that day, and I consider myself   _   to have witnessed his lesson.",
