Why don't I get a great education?\" But the real reason why most people are successful or lucky is that they've learned how to  _  themselves in a place so they can be lucky. They've learned how to, in a way,  _  their own luck! I'm not  _  about dishonest or illegal ways. I'm talking about hard,  _  work. But successful people work smart. They keep improving and making the most of their abilities. Yet they also learn to  _  for help in things they themselves are not that good  _  doing. So we not only must make the most of our own special strengths, we must also learn our  _  and weaknesses. A man recently got his lucky big break. Everyone said, \"That guy's so lucky!\" But that man created his own luck  _  by arriving at the office early. He apologized and  _  when he was wrong. He even shared the credit and reward with others  _  he had done much of the work. He was never satisfied just to get  _  and do average work. He always  _  the extra effort to do his very best. We have to work hard and do what it  _  to be on the way to luck and success when it comes.  _  , weMI miss it because we aren't ready. You never know when the right opportunity will come your way, and when the right, important person is watching your excellent  _  and work. That's when you'll get your lucky break! But when you put your life in Jesus Christ's  _  , the right important person is always  _  you and all that you do. Then he will  _  and bless vour life in manv wavs as vou do vour very best to please him in every thina every dav.",
