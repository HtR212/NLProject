    "article": "Chinese students are generally used to studying very hard for long hours. This is an excellent   _   , but it is often an inefficient way of study. An efficient student must have   enough   sleep, food, and rest. Every day you should take a walk or play basketball or do something you find   _   . And it is also necessary for you to see a film   _   visit some scenic spots every now and then so when you   _   to your study, your mind will be refreshed and you'll learn better. Endless hours of nodding over your books are   _   effective than shorter and more   _   study.\n       Be realistic. If you set   _   goals for yourself ,you'll only be disappointed in your progress.  Psychologists have found that learning   _   this way: First , you make   _   great progress that you feel very happy . Then your language ability seems to stay   the same   :  you  believe you are not learning anything      at all    and you will feel    _   . This period can last for days or   _   weeks but you must not be   _   . At some point your language ability will again take   a   big jump and you'll see that you really have been learning   all the time   . \n        Perhaps we can say that learning English is like   _   Chinese medicine in that its effects come slowly but   _   . so you must remember : don't give   _   halfway.",
