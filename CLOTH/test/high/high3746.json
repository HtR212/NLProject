    "article": "It's only after three weeks into a new job that I made a serious mistake. My boss called it \"extremely embarrassing\" in a company-wide e-mail -- which,  by the way  , he wrote because he felt he needed to explain that what I did was something  no one  in the company should ever do. I wish I  _  give a good excuse for what I did. At the very least, I wish I could explain it somehow --  _  it on youth, inexperience or ignorance. Unfortunately, I'm  _  , experienced and I know better.  _  I work with some very kind and compassionate people. For the past couple of days many of them have taken time to  _  by my desk and offer comfort, encouragement and support. Some have shared with me similar  _  they have made. Evidently I'm not the only \"  _  \" person here. One of the exchanges I had this week was with Lois, the much-honored, much-respected professional who  _  the desk right next to mine. Lois was completely  _  about her work, and to be honest I was a little nervous about how she would  _  to such an extremely embarrassing incident. As I expected, Lois didn't pass over the  _  when she saw me the next day. She mentioned it directly,  _  with empathetic consideration. She listened to my  _  . Just as I was ready to express my regrets, she brought my self-pity partly to a(n)  _  . \"It happened\", she said, \"There's nothing you can do to  _  that. It happened. But it's over now. It's  _  . It's in the past. You need to let it go, and move on.\" And with that she returned her  _  to her work, as if to say, \"We're done here.\" I beat myself up for weeks. At such times I need to remember those  _  words: It's over. It's done. Let it go. And mostly, move on.",
