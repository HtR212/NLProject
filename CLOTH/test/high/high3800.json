    "article": "One winter during college in New York, I took an 8: 00 a.m. history class. The professor was very  _  in class. He just looked at his lecture notes and  _  looked up at us. I felt that I needed to get rid of my boredom, so I created a little  _  for myself. I tried to find something from his lecture to ask a question about, forcing me to  _  rather than letting my eyes close. The first time I raised my hand, he was surprised, but obviously pleased to have a question to answer.  In fact  , his answers were always interesting. I continued to do this every day in the course and found my-self ac tually  _  the material. The professor became a bit more  _  and some other students also joined me in asking questions. My little game had  _  me from being bored,  _  it was expected to do. I learned a lot about world history in the discussions with him. The professor obviously knew his material, but had a hard time  _  it on to his undergraduates in an interesting way. On the last day of class we gathered our books and headed for the door for the last time. The shy professor stepped directly in front of me as I reached the door. \"Thank you for making this class so interesting,\" he said. I was so surprised. To me, it had been a pleasant way to pass the time; I had no idea that my asking questions had an effect on him and the others at all. That moment has stayed with me for 30 years. Each of us can have a(n)  _  not just on our own experiences, but on those of others, and I'll never forget the professor who taught me a lesson about the power of acts of kindness, intended  _  not.",
