He didn't hate the true meaning of Christmas, but the commercial aspects. Knowing this, one year I  _  to reach for something special just for Mike. The  _  came in an unusual way.\nOur son Kevin, who was 12 that year, attended a wrestling match against a team sponsored by an inner-city church shortly  _  Christmas. These youngsters' sneakers were in  _  and the shoestrings seemed to be the only thing holding them  _  , compared to our boys' gold uniforms and shoes. I was even shocked to find they had no helmets.\nMike, seated beside me,  _  his head sadly, \"I wish just one of them could have won,\" he said. \"They have a lot of potential, but losing could take their dreams away.\" That's when the idea for his  _  came.\nThat afternoon, I went to a local sports store and bought some wrestling helmets and  _  and sent them anonymously  to the inner-city  _  . On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note  _  telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me. His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year.\nFor each Christmas, I  _  the tradition. The envelope became the most exciting part of our Christmas. It was always the  _  thing opened on Christmas morning and our children, ignoring their unwrapped   new toys, would stand with wide-eyed  _  as their dad lifted the envelope from the tree to exhibit its  _  .\nAs the children grew, the toys  gave way to  more practical presents, but the envelope  _  lost its temptation. The story doesn't end there.\nWe lost Mike due to cancer. When Christmas rolled around, I was in  _  . But Christmas Eve found me placing an envelope on the tree, and in the morning, three more  _  it. Each of our  _  , had placed an envelope on the tree for their dad. The tradition has grown and someday will expand further with our grandchildren standing around the tree  _  as their fathers take down the envelope with expectation. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us.",
