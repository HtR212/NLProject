My dad suffered from leukemia in 1998.  _  the pain and treatment that he put up with inspired me to be a more kind and  _  person. I realized life is just too  _  and it was time for me to make some changes -- do the things in life that I wanted to do without making  _  why I couldn't do them. My dad  _  a bone marrow transplant operation, and after that he was able to reuse his own \"cleaned\" marrow, so a donor was not needed. That was excellent  _  because donors who are a match are hard to come by. That  _  me to become a bone marrow donor and hopefully help someone else one day. I also  _  money for the cancer patients. Yet, I was not satisfied with just that. I had to do more, I  _  blood every other month and seek opportunities to do other acts of kindness daily. The opportunity, some days, presents itself very  _  and some days I have to seek it out. Either way, it comes. I would like to  _  one of my favorite quotes with you all: \"In an average lifetime, a person  _  about sixty-five thousand miles. That's two and half times around the world. I wonder  _  your steps will take you. I wonder how you'll use the rest of the  _  you're given.\" I want to use my miles to create foot prints of love in this world.",
