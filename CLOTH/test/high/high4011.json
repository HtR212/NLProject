    "article": "A young man told me an amazing story. He was   _  Scotland on a motorbike by himself.\nOne late afternoon he was on the road between Aberdeen and Elgin. He was\ntraveling along, miles from any village, when he saw a really  _  girl standing by the road, hitchhiking  . Anyway, he stopped and said he would give her a   _  to Elgin. She got on and he drove off. He said he  _  having\nher on the back, as it was nice  _  . But after a time he forgot that\nshe was there. Suddenly he  _  her, but he realized that he\ncouldn't feel her knees  _  against him! He  _  behind him but...she wasn't there.\nHe said he felt frightened   out of  his life! He felt cold all over. He thought she must\nhave  _  off the back. So he turned round and  _  back along the road. He didn't find her. He went to see if she had crawled\ninto a field or something. But he didn't find her. So he began to think that\nshe might have been  picked up  by someone else.\nAnyway, he drove on towards Elgin and didn't see anyone   _  he came to a pub. He\ndecided to  _  so that he could talk to someone and he thought he\nought to tell 35 someone . He went into the pub and talked to the barman. He\ntold the barman what had happened. But the barman didn't seem to be at all  _  . He just carried on 37 _ the bowls.\nThen the barman said, \"You are not the   _  person to come in here and tell the\nsame   39 _ . That girl you think you picked up  died  seven years ago... in a motorbike accident.\"",
