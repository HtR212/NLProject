    "article": "America's Beauty Is in Its Diversity America is built on the idea of freedom, and there is no exception for Muslim women. I  believe in  the freedom of religion and speech. But mostly, I believe it's OK to be  _  , and to stand up for who and what you are. So I believe in wearing the hijab. The hijab is a religious head covering, like a scarf. I am Muslim, and keeping my head covered is a  _  of maturity and respect toward my  _  and to Allah's will.  To be honest  , I also like to wear it to be different. I don't usually like to do what everyone else is doing. I want to be a(n)  _  , not just part of the crowd. But when I first wore it, I was also afraid of the  _  that I'd get at school. I  _  on my own that sixth grade was the  _  I should start wearing the hijab. I was  _  about what the kids would say or even do to me. I thought they might make fun of me, or  _  be scared of me and  pull off  my headscarf. Kids at that age usually like to be all the same, and there's little or no  _  of differences. On the first day of school, I put all those  _  thoughts behind my back and walked in with my head held high. I was holding my breath a little, but  _  I was also proud to be a Muslim, proud to be wearing the hijab, proud to be different. I was  _  about everything I thought the kids would say or even do to me. I actually met a lot of people because of wearing my head covering. Most of the kids would come and ask me questions --  _  -- about the hijab and why I wore it. I did hear some kids were making fun of me,  _  there was one girl----she wasn't even in my class, and we never really talked much---and she spoke  in favor of  me, and I wasn't even there! I made a lot of new friends that year, friends that I still have until this very day, five years later. Yes, I'm different, but everyone is different here, in one way or another. This is the  _  of America.",
