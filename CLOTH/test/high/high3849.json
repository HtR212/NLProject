    "article": "Charles Plumb, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate, was a jet fighter pilot in Vietnam. After 75 combat missions, his plane was  _  by a surface-to-air missile. Plumb was  _  and spent six years in prison in Vietnam. He survived and now  _  about lessons learned from that experience. One day, Plumb and his wife were sitting in a restaurant when a man at another table came up and said, \"You're Plumb! You  _  jet fighters in Vietnam from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk . You were  shot down  !\" \"How in the world did you know that?\" asked Plumb. \"I  _  your parachute,\" the man replied. Plumb gasped in surprise and  _  .The man pumped his hand and said, \"I guess it worked!\" Plumb assured him, \"It  _  did--if your chute hadn't worked, I wouldn't be here today.\" Plumb couldn't sleep that night,thinking about that man. He says, \"I wondered how many times I might have passed him  _  the Kitty Hawk. I wondered how many times I might have seen him and not even said 'Good morning, how are you', or anything  _  , you see, I was a fighter pilot and he was just a  _  .\" Plumb thought of the many days the sailor had spent on a long wooden table in the bowels of the ship  _  working on each chute, holding in his hands each time the  _  of someone he didn't know. Plumb asks his  _  , \"Who's packing your  _  ? Everyone has someone who provides what they need to make it  through  the day.\" Plumb also says that he needed many kinds of parachutes when his plane was shot down-he needed his  _  parachute, his mental parachute, his emotional parachute, and his spiritual parachute. He called on all these  _  before reaching safety. His experience reminds us all to  _  and be kind to people who pack our daily parachutes, and strengthen us to go through  _  times.",
