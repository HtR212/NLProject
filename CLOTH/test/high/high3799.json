    "article": "One day, a professor entered the classroom and asked his students to prepare for a surprise test. They waited anxiously at their desks for the test to begin. The professor   handed out   the question papers, with the text facing down as usual.   _   he handed them all out, he asked his students to   _   the page and begin. To everyone's surprise, there were no   _  , just a black dot in the center of the page. The professor, seeing the expression on everyone's face, told them the following:\n\"I want you to write what you   _   there.\"\nThe students,   _  , got started on the inexplicable  task.\nAt the end of the class, the professor   _   all the answer papers and started reading each of them aloud in front of all the students. All of them, with no   _  , described the black dot, trying to explain its position in the middle of the sheet, etc. After all had been   _  , the classroom was silent, and the professor began to explain:\n\"I'm not going to grade this. I   _   wanted to give you something to think about. No one wrote about the   _   part of the paper. Everyone focused on the black dot, and the same happens in our   _  . We have a white paper to observe and   _  , but we always focus on the dark spots. Our life is a   _   given to us with love and care, and we always have   _   to celebrate: nature renewing itself every day, our friends around us, the job that   _   our livelihood and the miracle we see every day.\n  _  , we insist on focusing only on the dark spots: the health issues that bother us, the lack of money, the   _   relationship with colleagues, the   _   with a friend, and etc.\nThe dark spots are very   _   compared to everything we have in our lives, but they are the ones that pollute our minds.\"",
