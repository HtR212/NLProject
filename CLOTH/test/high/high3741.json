The doctor came,  _  him and said, \"You will be well soon in a few days if you take bull's milk.\" The King was  _  , for he had never heard of a bull that gave milk. \"How is it  _  ?\" he asked. \"Order Gulbo to get it for you,\" answered the doctor, \"He can do anything.\" Gulbo was a person with great knowledge and was  an enemy  to the doctor. So the doctor thought this would be a way of making him  _  . When the King told Gulbo what the doctor said and  _  him to get bull's milk, Gulbo  _  understood what the doctor was trying to do. When he got home, he sat thinking how to get out of the  _  . His daughter, seeing him worried, asked what was the  _  . On hearing what the King had asked for, she said, \"don't  _  , Father, I will help you.\" The next day she took some old clothes, went to the bank of the river near the palace, and chose a place  _  the King's bedroom window. In the middle of the night, she started to do her washing. She made so much noise  _  the King could not sleep. The King got very angry and sent a guard to  find out  what was the matter. The soldier found the girl, and led her to the King. \"Why do you wash your clothes here at night?\" said the King. The girl  _  to be afraid and said, \"I had to wash clothes at night. This afternoon my father had a baby, I was  _  all day because of that. Then I found there were no clean  _  for the baby, so I had to come and wash them now.\" \"What!\" cried the King. \"Are you trying to make a  _  of me? I have never heard of man having a baby.\" \"Well, if the King himself orders someone to get bull's milk for him,  _  can't a man have a baby?\" The King smiled and said, \"You must be Gulbo's  _  . Go and tell your father that he may keep the bull's milk for his  _  .\"",
