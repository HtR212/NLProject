I spent three or four hours  _  out warm dinner to the homeless out in the streets and then in a homeless shelter not far from the Bay Bridge as well.\nI was in high school and at the time my sister was too  _  to join in. She wanted to help,34 _ she made many chocolate chip cookies for me to35 _ and hand out to people. When getting to the shelter, I passed out the  _  .I began making sandwiches and  _  them with the crowd. I had the boxes with my sister's38 _  in them and began to  _  around, offering them to anyone near me.\nI moved towards an40 _ gentleman and said, \"Sir,would you like a cookie?\" He stopped and turned around. He looked at me and said, \"What did you say? Did you call me sir?\" I told him I had, and his eyes   _   a little bit and said, \"No one has42 _ called me sir in the past 60 years.\" So he was completely moved.\nIt43 _ me.\nI explained I had been raised that44 _ a person's color1 and social position were, he deserved respect. It  _  me to think that just because he was homeless, no one   _   him the honor. It broke my heart. I just didn't understand  _  no one ever called him sir. I had never thought that anyone was below me because I wasn't raised that way. Every  _  person deserves to be treated with respect. Years later, I still carry that memory and the  _  it taught me. Sometimes,what we are raised to believe can50 _ make a difference in someone's life.",
