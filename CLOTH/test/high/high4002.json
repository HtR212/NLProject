    "article": "Yesterday I totally changed my views about life after a talk with one of my friends. He told me despite being  in debt  , he was happy and  _  that it was because of something he saw in India. A few years ago he was  _  feeling sad and was touring India.He said right in front of his very eyes, he saw an Indian mother  cut off  her child's right hand with a knife.The helpless  _  in the mother's eyes and the painful scream of the  _  four-year-old child still remained in his mind. The  _  mother made the child handicapped (disabled)  so that  he could go out on the streets to beg.  _  by the scene, he dropped a small piece of bread he was eating.And almost at once, several children  _  around this small piece of bread covered with sand,  _  bits from one another.It was the  _  reaction of hunger.He then went to the nearest bakery and bought every single loaf of bread.  _  he gave out the bread to the children (mostly handicapped), he  _  cheers and bows from these  _  children.For the first time in his life, he understood  _  people could give up their  _  for a loaf of bread.He came to  _  how fortunate he was to be able to have a sound body, have a job, have a family, have the chance to  _  about food that didn't taste good, and have the many things that these people in front of him  _  dreamed of having.Perhaps life wasn't bad at all.",
