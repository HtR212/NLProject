All the cars stood up in a line, and drivers  _  blowing horns to get rid of their  _  . I got down from my car and moved forward in search of the  _  of the traffic jam. At a turning a young man was struggling hard to move forward his car, which might  break down  . Everyone there was just  _  the man without coming to offer  _  to him. In the meantime, they were  _  the man for the traffic jam. The number of cars was gradually increasing. The man looked   _  as everyone put him to the scorn   for creating this public  _  . Nobody was in the mood of  _  the man for his error.\nSeeing this, I  _  rushed to help the man, followed by other four drivers. We  _  to push the car. Very soon it started with loud sound. The man smiled in  _   the moment his car worked again. Then he thanked us and made a(n)  _  to everyone there and moved off.\nAfter that I went into deep thinking over the human  _  in the times of crisis . Every human on this earth unavoidably make errors. When other people do that we blame, but when we are in the same condition we desire to gain  _  . In the times of crisis we should try to  _  them instead of blaming others. Forgiving is a  _  choice, as it not only avoids conflicts further, but also spreads love.",
