As I entered, I found a very old woman bent over a  _  near the door.Her back was so  _  twisted by some misfortune that her face nearly  _  the tabletop.1 sat down  _  her a couple of tables away. \"Poor woman,\" I thought.\"What does she  get out of  life? Why does God let people live so long past their prime ?\" As I thought, another  _  lady entered the shop and sat down with her.Soon the two of them were  talking about  childhood days.They talked of how little the shop had changed in 70 years.In minutes, the two of them were shaking with  _  . I looked again at the first woman, then in the  _  on a nearby wall, catching a picture of myself.I was wearing a dirty shirt.She was  _  dressed in white, her face carefully made up and her hands  _  with gold rings.I was  _  .She was laughing.I was putting the  _  of my life together.She had millions of  _  memories to recall.  In secret  I was worried about getting old.She was old, but it wasn't  _  her.As I left the shop, I thought of my  _  question about God letting people live past their prime.Why, that woman was more  _  to life than I was.Age has not  _  her spirit.",
