At first, he climbed very well, but as he went on, he became weak and often looked at his worn-out shoes   instead of   looking up. Finally, when the clouds gathered around him, he understood he wouldn't be able to   _   the top that day. He would sit down to rest and then   give up  .\nOne day, he went up the mountain   _   by old Peeper, the town optician  . Halfway to the top, Peeper gave him a pair of   _   sunglasses. \"If it starts clouding over, put these glasses on. They'll   _   you,\" said Peeper before he went back. Bobby accepted the   _  .\nJust as nearly always seemed to happen, bad luck   _   in the form of cloud cover. Bobby remembered Peeper's   _   and put on the glasses. He could   _   see the clouds with the glasses on, but they seemed so light that he could see the top of the mountain   _   the clouds. And so Bobby kept climbing, leaving the clouds behind, and   _   arrived at the top of the mountain. He felt great. But as he took off the glasses, he was   _   -- the mountain below was surrounded by a sea of clouds. Bobby didn't remember the clouds being as   _   as that, so he looked more closely at the sunglasses, and   _   everything.\nPeeper had made a light picture on the glasses, in the   _   of the snow-covered mountain top. It was made in such a way that Bobby could only   _   it if he looked upwards.\nBobby   _   that the only obstacle   to getting to the top of the mountain had been his own discouragement. He thanked Peeper for using that little   _   to help him understand that his aim was not impossible.",
