    "article": "Every decision is made within a decision environment, which is defined as the collection of information, alternatives, values. Many decision makers have a(n)  _  to seek more information than required to make a good decision. When too much information is sought and obtained, one or more of several  _  can arise. * A  _  *  _  overload will occur. In this state, so much information is available that decision-making ability actually  _  because the information in its entirety can no longer be managed or assessed  _  . A major problem caused by information overload is  _  . When too much information is taken into memory, especially in a short period of time, some of the information (often that received early on) will be pushed out. *Selective use of the information will occur.  That is to say  , the decision maker will choose from among all the information available only those facts which support a preconceived solution or position. *Mental fatigue occurs, which  results in  slower work or poor quality work. *  _  fatigue occurs, where the decision maker tires of making decisions. Often the result is fast, careless decisions or no decisions are made at all. The quantity of information that can be processed by the human mind is limited. Unless information is  _  selected, processing will be biased toward the first part of the information received. After that, the mind tires and begins to  _  subsequent information or forget earlier information. A common  _  about decision making is that decisions are made in isolation from each other: you gather information, explore alternatives, and  made a choice  , without regard to anything that has gone before. The fact is, decisions are made in a context of other decisions. We might say, then every decision  _  from previous decisions: enables many future decisions, and assists other future decisions.",
