How would I, an eight-year-old girl from India, make Friends in America? On my first day at Anna Silver Public School, I  _  Miss Alice McNally, my class teacher, who couldn't get my name  _  --- although she tried hard, she usually called me Diya or Diva instead of Divya. But she  took care  to speak to me in a way that was easy for me---slowly,  _  words clearly---to get me used to the American  _  . When discovering that I enjoyed  _  , she took me to meet the art teacher. Miss McNally made sure that I was in perfect harmony with her class, and I had as much  _  as any schoolgirl could have from school. When my father was transferred back to India, I had to  _  Anna Silver Public School. I was going to leave before a scheduled fishing trip, and I'd  _  the class photo session too. Therefore, with a heavy heart, I left my school and the US. Back in Kerala, I received a  _  Surprise one day---a package in which Miss McNally and my twenty-four former classmates had written me a letter each,  _  me about the fishing trip and interesting things that happened while taking the class photo. Miss McNally added, \"Keep up with your drawing, since you love it so much.\" Miss McNally not only made a  _  little girl feel at home in a faraway country, but also taught me and the others, at an early age, the importance of being kind to others.",
