    "article": "Once upon a time a king, in the company of his ministers, went to the imperial garden for a walk. When he was walking around a pond, a strange idea  _  upon him and he asked, \"How many buckets of water are there in the pond?\" The ministers looked at each other,  _  to give an answer. Rather  _  , the king ordered, \"You have three days' grace. Any one who offers an answer will be handsomely awarded. Those who fail will be  _  .\" The time limit was due in the twinkling of an eye, yet the ministers were still at their wit's end. At this time a child appeared who declared that he knew the answer. The king told his  _  ministers to go with the child for the measurement. To their  _  , the child refused the suggestion with a smile, \"It is very easy. No  _  to go to the pond.\" This made the king laugh  _  , \"Alright, let us know what it is.\" The child winked and said, \"That  _  on the size of the bucket. If it is as big as the pond, there is one bucket of water; if it is half as big, two buckets; if one third as big, three buckets; if...\"\"Stop! That's it. You've got the  _  .\" The king was satisfied and the child was duly rewarded. Why did the ministers feel it so different to settle the problem? Because they fell in a pitfall , following a wrong way of thinking. People's thinking often goes a habitual way -- the beaten track of straightforwardness.  _  is a static way presupposing every object definite and certain, i.e. the size of the pond and the bucket should be clearly  _  . If one of them is unknown, it will be difficult to do the measurement, let alone  _  . Why not change your mode of thought -- from static to dynamic , from concrete to  _  ? If you adopt an indirect way and try to find out the proportional relation between the pond and the bucket, you'll get an answer -- flexible yet  _  to solve the problem. Sometimes to get out of the difficulty one must change one's way of thinking, or simply change one's approach towards a problem.",
