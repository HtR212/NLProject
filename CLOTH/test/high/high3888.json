    "article": "I have two friends who are backpackers. There is a portion of New York's Adirondack Mountains called the High Peaks region. It is made up of 46 mountains with a  _  of over 4,000 feet.\nThe Adirondack Mountain Club gives special honor and a patch to   _  who climbs all 46 mountains. My two friends decided to go for this  _  . It took them several years to accomplish it.\nMy friends had climbed 45 of the mountains. The left one was the farthest,  _  much effort. A hiking trail led past the base of the mountain,  _  from that point they were on their own.\nEarly one morning they left their  _  and walked 5 miles on the hiking trail to the base of a  _  of mountains. One of the mountains in this chain was the last one they   _  for their patch.\nWhen they reached the base of the mountain chain they  _  that they had left their compass and map back in the camp.  Rather than  returning to the camp, they decided to go on without them.\nFor hours they  _  uphill suffering heat and black flies. Finally, late in the afternoon, they  _  themselves on the top of a mountain. They were tired but  _  .\nThe excitement was short-lived however. When they  looked across  the valley, they saw another higher mountain. They had climbed the  _  hill! It was too late that weekend to correct their  _  . They had to wait another 4 months to climb the right mountain.\nThis story  _  that often in life we make effort toward a  _  but without the right map and personal compass it is easy to get  _  .\nKnowing your life purpose gives you a  _  personal map and compass. And that makes sure you are always climbing the right mountain.",
