By the way  , have you ever  _  there?\"\"Certainly,everyone  _  home will laugh at me if I leave China without seeing  _  .\" He was deep in thought when I began to talk  _  a guide.\"The Great Wall is one of the wonders in the world. We are very  _  of it.\"Soon I was interrupted again by his order--\"You don't say!\"I  _  help asking,\"  _  do you ask me not to talk about it?\"\"Well, I didn't ask you  to do  so,\"He answered,greatly  _  .I said,\"Didn't you say 'you don't say'?\"  Hearing  this, the English  laughed  to tears.He began to  _  ,\"'You don't say' actually means really. It is an  _  of surprise. Perhaps you don't pay attention to English idioms.\"  _  then did I know I had made a fool of  _  .Since then I have been more careful with idioms.",
