    "article": "On the first day of my high school, I ran into my new English teacher, Ms. Kirschmann. I really mean that - I almost knocked her   _  .\nOn entering my English classroom, I hit somebody hard. She was tall with red hair, and she was   wearing   a black and white skirt. As I began to   _  , she started \"yelling\" at me. But soon I realized that she was,   in fact  , saying hello and welcoming me to her class in a very   _   voice. I realized that I had just met my new English teacher a moment ago.\nKirsch, as she wanted us to call her, had a   _   and fascinating character. Her hair color1, fashion sense and energy took up the entire room. When we read the play Macbeth by Shakespeare, Kirsch let us play   _   and wear masks. There was a big drum in the classroom. Every time we read the word \"thunder\" in the text, she would hit   _   on the drum, making a loud noise! My classmates and I would   _   loudly.\nDuring group discussions, Kirsch often told us to sit in a   _   on the floor. We talked about the   _   while she just sat in a corner and took notes of what we said. Doing so made us feel independent and   _   ourselves more with critical thinking. It is the strangest   _   the most entertaining class I have ever had.\nKirsch is really a \"social butterfly\". She smiles, laughs and tells jokes   _   she goes. But I found out about another   _   of her the other day.\nAfter school that day, I was walking by my English classroom   _   I saw Ms. Kirschmann with her son. She was trying to   _   him to put on his jacket in a low voice. She spoke in such a gentle manner that I was quite   _  . Until then, it never   _   to me that Ms. Kirschmann could be quiet. I had thought she was   _   energetic, calm, intelligent and caring all at once. All I know was that I couldn't wait for the next day of her English class.",
