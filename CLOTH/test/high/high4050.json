    "article": "I was walking down the road one day when my cell phone rang. A little girl's voice on the other end  _  , \"Dad, please come back soon. I miss you so much!\" Instinctively , I knew it was a(n)  _  number, so I rudely  _  , \"You've dialed the wrong number!\" and then  hung up  . During the following days, I got the same call  now and then  . But I didn't care much about it. Then one day she constantly called me,  even if  I didn't answer. Finally I answered the phone and heard a torpid voice, \"Dad, please come back. I miss you so much! Dad, I'm in so  _  pain! Mom said you were too busy to take  _  of me. But, dad, please  _  me again, OK?\" The innocent  _  was difficult to reject. I made a loud kiss on the phone and heard the  _  voice say, \"Thank you ... Dad, I am so ... happy, so ... happy ...\" Shortly after this, I became  _  about who had been on the other end of my phone. So I called back, and a woman answered, \"Sorry, sir. I am really sorry to have  _  you. My daughter has suffered from bone cancer  _  she was born. And her father died in an  _  a short while ago. I  _  not tell her this news. Poor baby. When she couldn't  put up  with the painful chemotherapy , she would cry for her dad, who had always  _  her, so I gave her a random  _  number...\" \"How is your daughter now?\" I couldn't wait to ask. \"She has  gone  . You must have kissed her on the phone, because she went with a smile, tightly holding the cell phone ...\" Tears filled my eyes. Little help may make big effect.",
