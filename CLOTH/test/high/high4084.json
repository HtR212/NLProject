    "article": "Spending two days wondering if your father will live or die brings you many things. It allows you to  _  every moment of life. It fills you with good memories, and it fills you with pain. It  _  you of something that can easily be forgotten as you run around in your  _  life:life is incredibly fragile , and can be  taken away  in an instant.\nI sat there in this hospital room, feeding the man I've seen as  _  and capable in my entire life. It felt like the full circle of 1ife had come around us. It was both  _  and frightening. It felt  _  to support him, yet part of me wanted to tell him to \"be  _  \" again. I wasn't sure if I was ready to  _  the full meaning of it: that my father may  _  be that powerful and capable person again.\nPain and suffering have visited my family,  _  it will visit all families. And while we hesitate to  _  pain and suffering, it has great lessons to  _  us. Pain and suffering are well outside of the boundaries   of our everyday life. When it  _  , it broke these boundaries and turns our world upside down. We become a  _  with all of the others who have known pain and suffering. And we have another chance to tell what's truly  _  in our lives.\nThis crisis  will pass, and we'll all be changed by it. The  _  hands of time will do their work. I'm thankful that I've told my  _  everything I've wanted to say to him. And I'm thankful to have my family to  depend on  during this difficult time. We'll all be  _  by this to show more support, care, and love. This is as it should be.",
