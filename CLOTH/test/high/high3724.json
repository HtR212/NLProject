I was given a month to  prepare for  it. The day of the presentation arrived. I left home at 7 am with the intention of getting to the office  _  . On the way , my car climbed over a bunch of  _  rocks and I heard a loud noise. I stepped on the brake  _  and got out of the car to check what happened: I had a flat tire. \"Oh dear, please not now .\" I quickly ran behind the car to  _  the spare tire, only to be  _  again :there was none. I began to think of the moments when my wife would  _  me to get one each time I drove the car out. But I was too  _  to listen to her. It was already 8 am and it seemed like I had only one  _  left.
