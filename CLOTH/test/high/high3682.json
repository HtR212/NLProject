It's easy for us to do something without careful thinking, but it's hard for us to take back what we have done. There was once a  _  who repeated a bit rumor about a neighbor. Within a few days the whole community  _  the story. The person it concerned was deeply  _  and annoyed. Later, the woman responsible for  _  the rumor learned that it was completely  _  . She was very sorry and went to a  _  old man to find out what she could do to  _  the damage. \"Go to the marketplace,\" he said, \"and  _  a chicken, and have it  _  . Then on your way home, pluck its feathers and drop them  one by one  along the road.\"  _  surprised by this advice, the woman did  _  she was told. The next day the wise man said, \"Now, go and collect all those  _  you dropped yesterday and  _  them back to me.\" The woman  _  the same road, but to her disappointment, the wind  had blown  all the feathers away. After searching for  _  , she returned with only three in her hand. \"You see,\" said the old man, \"It's easy to drop them,  _  it's impossible to get them back. So it is with rumor.  _  doesn't take much to spread a rumor, but  _  you do, you can never completely make up for the wrong.\"",
