Please be  _  your seat belt is fastened.\" As the businessman looked around in the aircraft, it became obvious that many passengers were becoming a bit  _  . Later, the voice said, \"We are so sorry that we are unable  to serve  the meal at this time. The turbulence is still ahead of us.\" Lightning  lit up  the darkening skies, and within moments that great plane was like a  _  moving around on an ocean. One moment the airplane was  _  on terrific currents of air; the next, it dropped as if it were about to crash. All the passengers were upset and scared. Some were praying. The future seemed terrible and many were wondering if they would  _  it through the storm. Then, he suddenly saw a little girl. Obviously the storm meant  _  to her. She was reading a book and everything within her small world was  _  and orderly. Sometimes she closed her eyes, then she would  _  again; then she would straighten her legs, but worry and fear were not in her  _  . All the adults were scared half to  _  , but the great child wasn't afraid at all. The businessman could hardly believe his eyes. When the plane finally  _  its destination, he asked why she had not been afraid. The child replied, \"Because my Daddy's the pilot, and he's flying the plane to take me home.\" There are many kinds of storms that  _  us physically, mentally and financially. And many storms can easily and quickly darken our skies and  _  out planes into uncontrollable movement. Let us remember: Our Father is the pilot. He is in control and taking us home. So don't worry!",
