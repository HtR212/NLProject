    "article": "Teaching my first child, Danae, to share her toys was the biggest challenge. To   _   this, we started inviting other children to play, which could help Danae discover that it's fun to share with others -- a lesson I needed to   _   myself as well, as it   turned out  .\nOne evening Danae had 4 _ a friend, Natalie, to play with her. Their favorite was a children's card game called Go Fish. That evening, after Natalie left, Danae came to me and said, \"Mommy, I'd like to give these to Natalie tomorrow. They're her favorites.\"\nShe held up three cards from the Go Fish game. I tried to   _   that I didn't want her to give them away because then our   _   wouldn't be complete. \"But I really want her to have them!\" Danae    _  . I thought perhaps she didn't understand that when she gave something away, it was gone 8 _ . So I tried again, saying, \"Once you give the cards to her, you can't   ask for  them back tomorrow.\"\nA look of   _   came over Danae's face. For a moment I was happy that she seemed to   _  . But then she smiled and said. \"Well, that's okay; I want her to have them anyway.\"\n    What could I say to that? I sat   _   for a moment and then I realized I had been trying for so long to ask her to share. Did it   _   that our Go Fish set would be   _  ? What mattered was that my daughter was learning the   _   of giving, that she was thinking about others instead of herself, and that she was trying to make her friends happy. Isn't that what life is all about?",
