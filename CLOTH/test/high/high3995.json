    "article": "Recently, my husband and I had the chance to do something good for two complete strangers. This  _  us feel so good that I felt I had to share our experience. We were traveling to Mexico for  Thanksgiving  week with our family.  _  I traveled a lot for work, we had enough frequent flier miles and could upgrade our tickets to  _  class seats. We were sitting in the very first two seats in the first row of first class,  waiting for  the plane to take off. I overheard one of the flight attendants telling the others that there was a couple sitting in the  _  of the plane who had just got married the previous day and were heading off on their  _  . They had booked their flight eight months in advance  _  , due to some schedule changes, they had not been able to get  _  together. No one else on the plane was willing to move and the bride was  in tears  . I turned to my husband and told him what I heard. We immediately  _  and I called the flight attendant over to tell her that we would be happy to  give up  our seats to this couple. The flight attendant seemed  _  and amazed and said, \"Really? Are you sure\" We said, \"Of course!\" So we moved to the back of the  _  . I sat in a middle seat part way back and my  _  sat in the window seat in the last row of the plane. The flight attendants were extremely thankful and  _  good care of us even though we were no longer sitting in first class. We both made friends with the people  _  around us and had a great flight. I had to go back to the front of the plane to pick up a forgotten bag at one point during the  _  . I saw the newlyweds sitting very close together,  _  enjoying champagne . It didn't just make my day--it made my whole Thanksgiving  _  !",
