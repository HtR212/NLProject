Next morning\nI went to a watchmaker as I wanted my perfect watch to  be set  by\nthe exact time. The watchmaker examined my watch and said: \"The regulator\n  is to be pushed up   as  your watch is four minutes  _  .\"\nI tried to stop him, tried to   _  him understand that my watch kept perfect time, but he did not listen\nto me and pushed the regulator.\nMy beautiful watch began to gain time. It   _  faster and faster day by day. By the end of the second month it  had left  all the clocks and watches of the town far behind.\nWhat did I have to do? To take it to another watchmaker to be regulated. I expected him to regulate the watch immediately   _  he asked me to come in a week's\ntime. When at last I took my watch from him it began to  _  down. And I began to be late for trains, business appointments and\neven missed my dinners.\nNow I went to   the third  watchmaker.\nWhile I waited for him to repair my poor watch, he  _  it\nto pieces and said that he could finish this work  _  three\nor four days. I could do nothing but  agree  . That\ntime my watch worked for half a day and then stopped.\nSo I kept   _  my\nwatch from one watchmaker to another for a considerable period of time.\nAnd as a result of it the cleverest man in the world could not   _  the time by my watch. The\nthing was getting  _  . My watch had  _  two hundred dollars originally but I paid for repairs more than two\nhundred. At last I decided to buy  another  watch,\nwhich I did.",
