    "article": "On my first day in a college classroom , I felt like an overgrown child returning to civilization   after having been lost in the forest for thirty years . There I sat, 36 _  enough to be a father to most of the students in the room , 37 _  unconfident enough to be their baby brother . We were crowded elbow   to elbow , listening to a   _   who looked even younger than the students . I felt uncomfortable and out of place as the professor carefully   _   what she expected us to learn. As I listened, I couldn't help but   _   of my own oldest daughter who was now beginning her first year in   _  , just like me. I remembered how hard I had tried to help build self-confidence in her and my other children. So why did I suddenly feel like a scared   _   myself? When I walked out of that classroom, I had serious   _   about my ability to make it   _   college. Not until late that night did my thinking   _  . It was a long-distance   _   from my daughter, my fellow college freshman  , that did the trick . She spoke on the phone about the doubts, worries and anxieties she was   _  . She was certain that she'd never   _   at college. How   _   her worries sounded. In my most confident parental   _  , I said, \"Doing your best it all the world   _   .\" The next day in class, those words still repeated in my head. When the professor raised a   _   for the class, nobody, including me,   _   to answer. When I looked around at the   _   and uncertainty on the young faces in that room, I knew   _   what I had to do: my best. That's all the world asks. So raised my hand, and the professor called my name. I spoke.",
