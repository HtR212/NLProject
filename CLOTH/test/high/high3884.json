I saw that he had not 37 _  gotten his drink so I went over and 38 _  to help. Then I took him by the hand and led him to the 39 _ . I asked him if he needed anything else and he said he was fine, so I 40 _ .\nTwo hours later, I was 41 _  for my car and the rain started pouring down, and then I saw the young blind man. He was trying to 42 _  the street and using his stick to make sure that nothing was in his way. He pressed the button 43 _  the light would turn red and allow for a walking 44 _ . He was hesitant   about crossing the street and just 45 _  there. \nI went up to him and said, \"Hi!\" He smiled and said, \"Hey! You are the young lady who helped me at the 46 _ .\" I smiled and said, \"Yes.\"\nThen I took the 47 _  man's hand and led him across the street. I asked him how he normally 48 gets around . He said he does fine but he never crosses the street 49 _  in the rain because he can never 50 _  if a car is coming since he can't hear so well over the sound of the 51 _ . I asked him how he knew I was the 52 _  person from the restaurant. He said that he remembered my energy and he could 53 _  it just like before! \nI smiled as we 54 _  introductions for the first time. We made it to the other side of the street and he told me he was 55 _  now and could make the rest of the way on his own. So, we said good-bye and went our separate ways.",
