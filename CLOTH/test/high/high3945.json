He did an interview with Tara Hitchcock to talk about his   _   and his newly won title. \nBorn with no right leg, Robles said when he first started wrestling, his   _   were afraid they would hurt him. While some people might have   _   his decision to take on the sport, he said his family was a huge   _   of support and encouragement. \"They   _   me from a young age that I could do whatever I  _   my mind to, \" he said. \nWhile the physical aspects of the sport might seem to be the most   _   part for many athletes, at one 43 _  in his college career Robles said he realized he needed to be mentally   _  . After finishing seventh in a national match in his junior year, not nearly as well as he had hoped, he knew he had to do   _   .\n\"I took a   _   from wrestling for a little while,\" he said. \" I was burnt out. I let all the   _   get to me. I decided to walk away all summer. I didn't wrestle. I just lifted weights. That really just helped me to mentally   get back  to the sport ---- the sport that I love so much. \nLast week, Robles took part in his last college match. At the end of the match, he had   _    national champion, Matt McDonough, 7-1. Robles won the Championship.\nWhile some people have   _   the idea of going to the Olympics, the Arizona State University senior says his wrestling career is over. He's ready for the next 51 _  in his life.  \nI've had a   _   time with wrestling. I love the sport, but I think it's time to move on. I've done   _   I set out to do. I can finish on top. I really want to be able to   turn around   now and help other people achieve things in their lives that others might say are  _   ,\" he said.",
