    "article": "I was 28 at the time and my son had just been  _   into elementary school, and was sitting on a park bench  with me, telling me all about his friends and teachers in the new school. He was extremely  _  , I could tell. Looking up into the cloudy blue sky while I   _  , I was having a hard time thinking of questions to ask him about his new  _  , probably because he was answering every single one of them before I even  _   them.\nBeing in America, there were people of many different races and   _   that lived here,   _   I decided to ask him about those people. He loved  _  , and if he heard someone who had a different   _   or something like that, he would ask them where they were from. It was   _   for me. I thought he was being rude and didn't   _   it. But the people would always  _   and tell him where, whether it was the UK, China, you name it.   _  , he would get into his seat in my car and demand that I take him to the   _   so that he could learn about those places. I would   _   do it, giving him every bit of   _   he craved . He would even tell me fun facts, things that I didn't know about. He was   familiar with   the word \"foreigner\", even though he had no idea what it   _  . I signed and spoke, \"So, David, are there any   _   at your school?\" He looked at me   _   the biggest smile I had ever seen, swing his legs back and force on the bench.\n\"No, Daddy. Just kids.\"",
