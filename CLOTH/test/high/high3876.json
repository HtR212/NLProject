    "article": "Across the world, students are working hard as they prepare for all kinds of exams. Many teenagers complain that while they do well in their homework, they don't get\n  _   marks in exams. They are wondering why.\nIn a new study this month, U.S. psychologists   think they have found the answer. Researchers report that heavy exam   _   is actually more likely to affect the performance  of very good students than average ones.\nWorried about whether they can   _   others like parents and teachers, these students can lose their most   _   intellectual   weapon: short-term or working memory. This is their ability to   _   numbers and ideas while finding solutions to the problem at hand. According to the study, when   _   pressure is put on people with good skills, their performance drops off.\nPeople with strong working memory skills are very   _   to do well in intellectual ability tests. Their analytical skills and creative   _   depend on their short-term-focused processor  .\nIn the study, researchers   _   the working memory of 93 students. They were divided into two groups, with a high and a low   _   memory.\n    The students then took two maths tests each under   _   conditions. One was called a practice test. In the other, the students were told they were part of a team that was depending on them to   _   their score in order to win a reward.\n    The results showed   _   differences: the group with high working memory scored about 10 percent higher than the others on the low-pressure practice test. But the two groups'   _   were about equal on the other test when the pressure was higher.\n    The study shows how memory performance is   _   by fear of failure and the ticking clock, according to the scientists.",
