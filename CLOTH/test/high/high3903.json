Then I drove home, since it wasn't very  _  . I thought that there would be no  _  , because it was very late at night. However, to my surprise, I was  _  and left without my driving license for three months. I told my parents nothing  at the beginning  , but then I had to invent a lie, because I did not have the  _  to tell them that I had drunk alcohol and that was the real reason for which I was left without my driving license.\nThose three months seemed to pass very  _  for me, because I had got into the  _  of driving almost daily and I really needed my car quite often.

It was, indeed, a( n)  _  for me not to have my driving license and I told myself never to repeat this mistake.\n  Apart from  this, being drunk while driving  _  a real danger not only for the driver, but also for  _  .
