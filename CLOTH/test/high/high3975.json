    "article": "There at a secondhand clothing store in Northampton Mass, my l4-year-old son, John, and I noticed the coat. While the other coats drooped , this one looked as if it were  _  itself up. The coat was beautifully made, with a Fifth Avenue label and an  _  price of $28, which was popular just then with  _  , but could cost several hundred dollars new. John tried it on and the  _  was perfect. John  _  the coat to school the next day and came home with a big smile. \"Did the kids like your coat?\" I asked. \"They loved it,\" he said,  _  folding it over the back of a chair and smoothing it flat. Over the next few weeks, a  _  came over John. Agreement replaced contrariness and  _  discussion replaced fierce argument. He became more mannerly and  _  , eager to please. He would generously lend his younger brother his tapes and lecture him  _  his behavior. When I mentioned this  _  to his teacher and wondered what caused the changes, she said laughing. \"It  _  be his coat!\" Another teacher told him she was giving him a good mark not only because he had earned  _  but because she liked his coat. At the library, we ran  _  a friend. \"Could this be John?\" he asked surprisingly,  looking up at  John's new height, appreciating the cut of his coat and holding out his hand, one gentleman to another. John and I both know we should never  _  a person's clothes for the real person within them.  _  , there is something to be said for wearing a standard of excellence for the world to see and for  _  what is on the inside with what is on the outside. For John, it is a time when it is as easy to try on different  _  to life as it is to try on a coat. The whole world, the whole future is stretched out ahead, a vast landscape  _  all the doors are open. And he could picture himself walking through those doors wearing his wonderful, magical coat.",
