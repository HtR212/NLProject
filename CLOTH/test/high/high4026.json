The gentleman, whose  _  had just died in an accident, was answering the reporter's question, \"What would you do  _  if you had known you might not see your wife again?\" Of course, we would all act differently  _   we knew our time together with our love was running out.\nBack at the house, starting a load of laundry, I found myself thinking about the  _  . \"I would do something special\"  _  over and over again in my mind. That gentleman would never have that   _   , but I did. I hope my husband, Alan, and I have   _   forty years together. But there are no guarantees. Tomorrows are not  _  .\nWhen doing the washing, I had a little problem: I couldn't   _  the washing machine. All these years I had been   depending on   Alan to help me deal with such a situation. Suddenly I found it very important for me to fix the machine and give Alan a  _  . Then I began to   _   what was wrong.
