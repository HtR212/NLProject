But how well the two people knew each other did.\nA reciprocal   yawn was most 43 _  to occur among family members, then 44 _ , then acquaintances. The phenomenon was 45 _  common among strangers, the journal PLoS ONE reports.\nThe University of Pisa team concluded that contagious yawning is driven by how emotionally   46 _  we are to someone and so how likely we are to 47 _  the same feeling with them.\nThey say there are other reasons to link yawning with empathy. 48 For example , we start to \"catch\" yawns from the age of four or five, around the time when we 49 _  the, ability to identify each other's emotions 50 _ .\nStudies also show that those easily 51 _  by contagious yawning are better at knowing  52 _  others are thinking about from their faces.\nMost animals, including snakes and fish, yawn, 53 _  it is; only contagious in humans and chimps   and, according to a recent study, dogs.\nThe researchers, from the University of London's Birbeck College, put 29 54 _  in a room with a yawning man and found that 21, or 72%, also started to yawn. They said the skill may allow the pet to build stronger 55 _  with their owners.",
