I saw the crisscross of twisting, turning streets  _  to the square in the centre of the village. \"See, my dear,\" Father said gently. \"There is more than one way to the square. Life is like that. If you can't get where you want to go by one road, try  another  .\" Now I understood why I was there. Earlier that day I had begged my mother to do something about the  _  lunches that were served at school. But she  _  because she could not believe the lunches were so bad. When I turned to Father for help, he would not  _  . Instead, he brought me to this high tower to give me a lesson. By the time we reached home, I had a(n)  _  . At school the next day, I secretly  _  my lunch soup into a bottle and brought it home. Then I  _  the cook into serving it to Mother at dinner. The plan worked  _  . She swallowed one spoonful and sputtered , \"The cook must have gone mad!\" Quickly I told her what I had done, and Mother stated firmly that she would  take up  the matter of lunches at school the next day! In the years that followed I often remembered the  _  Father taught me. I knew where I wanted to go in life -- to be a fashion designer. And on the way to my first small success I found the road  _  . I was busy getting ready to  _  my winter fashions. Then just 13 days before the presentation the sewing girls were called out on strike. I felt so depressed that I was  _  that we would have to cancel the presentation  or else  show the clothes unfinished. Then it dawned on me. Why not show the clothes unfinished? We worked hurriedly and the showing took place as  _  . Some coats had no sleeves; others had only one. Many of our clothes were only  _  made of heavy cotton cloth. But on these we pinned sketches and pieces of material. In this way we were able to show what colors and textures the clothes would have when they were finished. It was our  _  showing that caught the attention of the public, and  _  for the clothes poured in. Father's wise words had guided me once again. There is more than one way to the square always.",
