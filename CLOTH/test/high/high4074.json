I took them to the shoemaker's.\nThe young apprentice glanced at the   _  and said, \"Nothing I\ncan do except  _  the upper.\"\nHis master looked at them and said, \"If you   _  me, I will add\nmore scratches on both the shoes. \"\nI was   _   and asked why.\nHe explained, \"As if the opening were made 50 on purpose  for a special style.\"\nI didn't fully understand him,   _  I decided to leave the shoes.\nTwo days later I dropped by from work to   _  the shoes. I found\nmorescratches on each shoe; all the openings were patched by soft red leather; the stitches  were twisted with the appearance looking more   _   and interesting than ever. I couldn't help praising the master's   _  .\nAnother time, my sister's blouse was torn, leaving a large opening. My wife checked it   _  , and then said, \"Let me take it home and   _   it.\"\nThree days later, seeing it again, I was greatly   _  : all the torn parts took on a look of ice crystal ;attached to it was a snowman made of flowery rags. I sighed with   _  , \"It's amazing!\"\n\"I was   _   by that shoemaker. Patches are supposed to be   _  , but a skillful\ncraftsman can make it take on a kind of   _  .\"\nreplied my wife.\nHer words inspired me more: perfection is impossible to achieve in   _  ;\npatches appear in the  _  of injury, disability\nor disease. Since you can't change the existence of wound, you should not  _  people's sympathy by disclosing the wound, which is\nmeaningless. Just sew the  _  by patches and\nproduce a most beautiful flower on it, and that is the significance of life.",
