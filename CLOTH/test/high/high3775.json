She was a small woman,   _   to catch the bus at a deserted bus stop.\n\"Where are you going now?\" the woman asked.\n\"Well, I don't know. I just want to see what it will be like at the   _  . You know I   _   it all. We were going to get   _   after four years' ups and downs. And he came one day, with nothing to say, just to show me a   _   on his finger.\"\nThe woman gave a   _   of sympathy. She seemed to well understand my pain. \"Now, do you want to   _   my life story while we're waiting for the bus?\" the woman asked me in a low voice. I gave her a   _   look and nodded my head.\n\"Exactly thirty-five years ago, my husband took me and my three children to America. The moment we arrived, he left us   _   with a wish for good luck, to   _   his own happiness. Yet how could I   _   my three children in a strange land, with no money, no relatives and a   _   heart? Then I took the kids to the beach one afternoon. However, the kids were scared and they cried   _  . Their desperation suddenly woke me up from a long nightmare. How   _   I was!\"\nShe continued, \"I hugged them tightly, feeling a sudden strength   _   me. Then, I did all the things that brought me   _   a penny. Days in, days out, we   depended on   each other to gather enough encouragement to go ahead. My kids grew up into good, responsible citizens. Later, I found a man with the same pain. I feel   _   has paid me off.\"\nThe woman stopped for a while. She   looked into   my eyes and whispered in my ears, \"Now stand up, little girl. Don't go to the terminal because there's nothing to see. Why don't you get cheered up and enjoy the   _   on the way?\"",
