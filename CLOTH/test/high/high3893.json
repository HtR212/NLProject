    "article": "My father left for our native place on Thursday. In fact, he had never traveled by  _  before, so I just took this opportunity to let him  _  his first flight.  In spite of  being asked to book a ticket by train, I got him a ticket on Jet Airways. The moment I handed over the ticket to him, he was surprised. The  _  was very apparent on his face as we waited for the time of the  _  . Just like a schoolboy, he was  _  himself on that day, using the trolley for his luggage and asking for a window seat. He was  _  enjoying himself and I, too, watching him experience all these things with  _  . As he was about to go in for the security check-in, he walked up to me with tears in his eyes and  _  me. He became very  _  for what I had done meant a great deal to him. I told him there was no need to thank me. Later, I  looked back on  my life. As a child, how many dreams had our parents made come true? Without  _  the financial situation, we asked for dresses, toys, outings, etc. They tried to  _  all our needs. Did we ever say thanks for all they had done for us? Today  _  it comes to our children, we always think we should give them the best. But we tend to  _  that our parents have sacrificed a lot to see us happy, so it is our  _  to make sure their dreams are realized. Old age is like a second childhood and just as we take care of our children, the same  _  needs to be given to our parents. I want to say sorry for making my father  _  so long for this small dream to be realized. Just the fact that they are old does not mean that they will have to  give up  everything and keep sacrificing. They have  _  , too. Take care of your parents. They are precious.",
