How  _  and kind her father was,and how cleverly he showed Marianne how to play some particularly difficult pieces ! She was making  _  and that was excellent.\nAnd there, almost  _  in the big chair, sat Wolfgang, her 4-year-old brother, who never had to be told to keep  _  when Marianne was practicing. One evening the father patted Marianne on the shoulder,  _  she had done remarkably well. At the moment, Wolfgang climbed on his father's knee and  _  to be allowed to play the pretty piece Marianne has now  _  What a  _  that was!  Picking up  his baby son, the father laughed,tapped the tiny nose and said, \" Look at your small  _  . Why, you cannot reach the  _  yet. You must  _  , young man !\"\n  _  was no end of fun during dinner,and Marianne had to tell her mother about Wolfgang  _  to play one of the classics. After dinner Marianne helped clear away the dishes when the father lit his pipe.\nBut the  _  went out. He was on his feet. \" Listen!\" he said in a( n)  _  voice. \" Listen ! Marianne is playing  _  piece much better than ever,\"he added. But Marianne was washing pots in the kitchen. His wife  _  , he walked quietly upstairs. The lamp in one hand, his pipe in the other, he pushed the door open, and  _  was little Wolfgang playing in the darkness. \" I love it so. \"  _  the child. It was the beginning of Mozart's life of music.",
