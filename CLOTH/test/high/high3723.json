    "article": "LAST weekend, I helped my friend Alex get money for poor children at Crossroads Mall He  _  needed volunteers, especially of the female. I decided that this was a pretty good  _  , so the next day I got ready to go. I arrived at Crossroads about five minutes  _  , and helped Alex and  the rest  of the volunteers. There were only three  _  at first, and we figured we might as well get started  instead of  just waiting for more to arrive. I held the  _  , and suddenly felt extremely shy. I did not  _  asking people for donations. In fact, I'm usually one of those people who try to  _  those boring stands and ask you for a little contribution. For heaven's sake, I can contribute to a few,  _  I cannot alone  _  every single cause in the world! I really didn't like the idea of asking anyone for donations to our cause.  However  , I watched my friends speak to the strangers, and noticed that they were extra polite to everyone--no matter whether they  _  . I realized that  as long a  I wasn't pushy , it would be okay, and my conscience could be  at ease  . I pasted on a large smile, and started asking people passing by. My mouth tripped over words, and I continually said \"um\" while I thought of the correct terms.  _  I talked to more and more people. Not only improved, but also started noticing small  _  . Instead of saying \"donate\", which made most people walk away  _  .I started suing the word \"contribute\". I added the phrase \"every little bit counts\", and people started to donate small amounts in larger quantities. As the day went on, I learned how to pull on the hearts of the  _  , and I became a successful fundraiser. At the end of the day, we all gathered at Alex's house and  counted  how much money we raised. I was so surprised; We raised over $300! We celebrated, and went home tired, but satisfied that we helped a great cause.",
