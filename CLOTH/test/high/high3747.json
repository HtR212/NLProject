I checked and found my tire was flat. Unfortunately I didn't have a   _   one. Worse still, it began to rain. I quickly jumped back into my car, and just sat there   _   to myself.\nThen it seemed out of   _   this older woman pulled up behind me. I told her about my problem and then   _   she offered to drive me there. I was telling the lady the   _   as we went and she told me she was heading the exact   _   way. I felt bad making her go out of her way but she would not   care about   it. On our arrival, I asked her for her name and number and thanked her for her trouble, feeling a tear roll down my cheek, not for my mother, but for the   _   of the stranger I had just met.\nAfter the funeral, I went back home and arranged for my car to be   _    . Everything became back to   _   for me and soon I forgot about this lady.\nYesterday I was looking through some old shoeboxes and came across her   _  . I called her. Her daughter answered and told me her mother had recently   _  . I was so shocked that I didn't talk for a minute or two. Finally I asked   _   the funeral was and decided to go to it.\nThe funeral was sad but it really made me realize something. You never know when you   _   die, so you must do your best to help others in order to make your life   _  . I am very   _   to this woman whom I never really had known, because she   _   my life. I now realize that in order for us to be truly happy, we all must love one another and work towards a   _   world and society.",
