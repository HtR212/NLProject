Do we want to  _  ourselves or do we want to walk on the surface? For some people, many friendships on the surface are  _  enough--and that's all right. But at some point we need to  make sure  that our expectations are the same as our friends' expectations. The sharing of  _  experience  including  our tears as well as our dark dreams is the surest way to deepen friendships.
