Before she came to  _  what would happen, the man was there, shouting through her window. \"Get out!\"\nNeilson  _  .\nPulling open her door, the man seized her  _  the neck and hair, and threw her out of the car onto the ground. She screamed,  _  her purse and the keys.\nTwo reporters of the local newspaper, Robert Bruce and Jeff Jackson, just outside their office building on a  _  , heard the screams and began running.\nWhen they  _  Neilson's car, the attacker had jumped into the driver's seat and was  _  searching for the keys. Bruce opened the door, and he and Jackson dragged the man out. The attacker  _  back. But even in his cornered panic, he was no  _  for the two athletic men.\nReggie Miller, a worker of the local newspaper, heard the screams, too. He rushed back to the office to  _  the police, and then ran back with some plastic ropes ---- used to tie up newspapers.\nWith his arms  _  tightly behind him, the prisoner looked up and said  _  , \"I hope you guys feel good about yourselves - you just caught one of the most wanted men.\" They  _  him and waited for the police.\nLater, Bruce and Jackson were shocked to learn the man was the  _  carjacker  and suspected murderer, whose  _  --but with a full head of hair - had been recently printed in their own newspaper.\nNeilson considers herself lucky  _  she suffered injuries. She believes the story might have had a  _  ending if those good people had not come to her aid. \"Unfortunately,\" she says, \"many people would  _  have done what they did, and that is the real truth.\"",
