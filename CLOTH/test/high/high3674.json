We invite you to join the funeral in the room that has been  _  in the gym. \" In the beginning, they all got  _  for the death of one, of their colleagues, but after a while they started getting  _  to know who was that person that hindered the  _  of their colleagues and the company itself? The  _  in the gym was such that security agents were ordered to control the crowd  _  the room. The more people  _  the coffin , the more the excitement heated up. Everyone thought, \"  _  is it that was hindering my progress?\" One by one the intrigued employees got closer to the coffin, and when they looked inside it, they  _  became speechless. They all got to stand near the coffin, and felt shocked and  in silence  , as if someone had touched the deepest part of their  _  . There was a mirror inside the coffin: everyone who  looked inside  it could see themselves! There was also a sign next to the mirror that  _  : \"There is only one person who is capable of setting  _  to your growth and IT IS YOU!\" Your life does not  _  when your boss changes, when your friends change, when your parents change, when your husband or wife changes... No, your life changes when YOU change, when you  go beyond  your limiting beliefs inside. Examine yourself; watch yourself. Don't be afraid of  _  , impossibilities and losses. Be a winner; build yourself and your reality.  _  , it's the way you face life itself that makes the difference.",
