The water was so 41 _  and he filled his leather canteen so he could bring some back to a tribal elder who had been his teacher.\nAfter a four-day journey he 42 _  the water to the old man, who took a deep 43 _ ,smiled warmly and thanked his 44 _  for the sweet water taken back from the 45 _ . The young man 46 _  to his village with a happy heart.\nLater, the teacher let another student taste the water. He spat it out, saying it was 47 _ . It 48 _ had become smelly because of the old leather 49 _ .\nThe student asked his teacher:\"Master, the water is awful. Why did you 50 _  to like it?\"\nThe teacher 51 _ , \"You only tasted the water. I tasted the 52 _ .The water was simply the container for an act of loving--kindness and nothing could be sweeter.\"\nI think we understand this 53 _  best when we receive innocent gifts of love from young children. Whether it's a handmade paper plane or a painting drawn by them, our 54 _  and proper response is appreciation because we love the idea 55 _  the gift.\nGratitude doesn't 56 _  come naturally. 57 _ , most children and many adults value only the thing given 58 rather than  the feeling expressed in it. We should remind ourselves and teach our children about the beauty and purity of feelings and expressions of 59 _ .\nAfter all, gifts from the 60 _  are really gifts of the heart.",
