    "article": "The night of graduation, I was afraid. Two hundred people were sitting out there. I felt tense and I wanted to run away,  _  I couldn't! After all, my own children were sitting in front of me with many other persons. I couldn't be a coward  before  _  .\nWhen I ended the speech, I was  _  at the cheering. And I never forget the first time I received the cheering in my life.\nFlowers arrived  _  my brothers and sister. My husband gave me silk roses. The reporters came with  _  and recorders and lots of questions. There were tears and hugs and congratulations.\nSometimes, I sit down and  put on  the tape of my gaduation speech. I hear myself say to the audience, \"Don't' give up your  _  in life. Anything can happen if you believe. It means hard work, but  _  sure that you can do it, with God's help.\"\nAnd then, I remember mother's  _  to me , a young girl: \"Hurry, Gin, you'll be late for school.\"\nYes, Mom, I was late  _  school, but it was sweeter for waiting. I only wish you and Dad could have been there to see your daughter and granddaughter in all their show and speech.",
