    "article": "It was only in the eighteenth century that people Europe began to think mountains were beautiful .  _  that time, mountains were  _  by the people living on the plains,  _  by the city people, to whom they were wild and  _  places in which one was easily  lost  or killed by terrible animals. Slowly ,however , many of the people who were living  _  in the towns began to grow tired of  _  . They began to feel interested in looking for things that could not be explained , for sights and sounds which produce a feeling of fear and excitement .  _  in the  _  century, people began to turn away from the man-made  _  to the untouched country, and particulary  _  a place where it was dangerous and wild. High mountains began to be  _  for a holiday. Then , mountain-climbing began to grow popular as a sport. To some people ,there is something greatly  _  about getting to the  _  of a hight mountain . Struggling against nature is finer than a battle  _  other human beings. And then, when you are at the mountain top after a long and difficult  _  , what a  _  reward it is to be able to look  _  on everything within  _  ! At such time, you feel happier and prouder than you can ever feel down  _  .",
