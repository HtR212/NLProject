But when I entered senior middle school I began to   _   the bitterness   of failure.\nA girl who was not as good as me in   _   middle school surpassed   me. My mother often scolds me. I can't   _   her, so when I return home I don't want to talk to her. When I do a good job, she   _   says, \"Don't be so   _  . Think of XXX, she did better than you.\" Am I proud?   _  . I just want to give   _   confidence. When I do something bad, she says, \"What are you doing? Think of XXX, she is always better than you.\" I had a(an)   _  talk with her. But she just said   _  , \"When you grow up, you will know that I have done good for you.\"\nI can't   _   with her. I don't want to go with her. What should I do?\n                                                                    Cinderella\nCinderella,\nFirst analyze   by yourself   _   you have fallen behind. Is there something wrong with you,   _   is the girl who surpassed you an outstanding person who is always at the   _  . And does it matter? Can you be number two and   _   do well in exams and get into a good university?\nTo communicate, ask your   _   about her own life. Did someone surpass her? If she regrets any experiences, she may hope you will realize her own   _  . This wish is common among   _  .\n  _  , don't blame that she should seek success. If she scolds but cannot help, she clearly knows study is important but does not know how to study  _  . ks5u\nDo   what   you think is best.",
