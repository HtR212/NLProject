    "article": "Old friends\nThey finish your sentences, they remember the cat that ran away when you were twelve, and they tell you the truth when you've had a bad haircut. But mostly, they are always there for you -- whether it's in person or   _  late night phone calls -- in good times and  _  . But as the years pass, it becomes increasingly  _  to see each other, to make new memories.  _  , my high school friends and I promised long ago not to let this happen. We promised to have reunions.\nA few months ago, we met up for a two-day  _  in the American Southwest. We grew up together in Maine and have said for years that we should have a(n)  _  event, yet it's often put off or  _  due to schedule conflicts . Not this year.\nThe weekend   consisted of  long talks by the pool, wonderful meals, and a hike that brought the entire group to  _   . Not tears of sadness or anger, but an outpouring of emotion over the complete wonderment that we can be this close -- twelve years after graduation -- with such physical  _  between us. It's heartbreaking that we can't spend our days together in the same neighborhood, walking the same streets, reading the same newspaper at the same coffee shop. But that's  _  . Grown-up life.\nMost  _   is the group's adaptability to one another. The time we spend   _  is non-existent. No need to get reacquainted  , we jump back in the saddle   and it's as comfortable as ever. Old friends -- friends with an ever-present   _  of support and sisterhood, friends that know each other innately   -- are hard to come by and yet we remain as   _  today as we were, years ago, giggling  in the back row of Mr. McKechnie's 9th grade math class.\nLife today,  _  , is no math class. Our world is full of  _   , full of fear. Yet it   _   me -- now, more than ever -- how important it is that we stay  in touch   . We may have questions about our future, but we have true faith in our past, and though this   _  of friends has come to a close, we are already drawing up plans for the next one.",
