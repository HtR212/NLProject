    "article": "My name is Elias. I am a poor black worker in South Africa. The time when I first met Nelson Mandela was  _  very difficult period of my life. I was twelve years old. It was in 1952 and Mandela was the black lawyer to whom I went for advice. He offered guidance to poor black people on their  _  problems. He was generous with his time,  _  which I was grateful. I needed his help because I had very  _  education. I began school at six. The school where I studied for only two years was three kilometers away. I had to leave because my family could not continue to pay the school fees and the bus fare. I could not read  _  write well. After trying hard, I got a job in a gold mine.  _  , this was a time when one had got to have a passbook to live in Johannesburg.  _  , I did not have one because I was not born there, and I worried about whether I would become out of work.. The day when Nelson Mandela helped me was one of my happiest. He told me how to get the correct papers so I could stay in Johannesburg. I became more hopeful about my future. I never forgot how kind Mandela was. When he organized the ANC Youth League, I  join  it as soon as I could. He said: \"The last thirty years have  seen  the greatest number of laws stopping our rights and progress, until today we have reached a stage  _  we have almost no right at all.\"",
