    "article": "I sat with my friend in a well-known coffee shop in a neighboring town of Venice. As we  _  our coffee, a man came in and sat at a(n)  _  table beside us. He called the waiter and placed his  _  saying, \"Two cups of coffee, one of them there on the wall\". We  _  this order with rather interest and observed that he was  _  with one cup of coffee but he paid for two. As soon as he left, the waiter  put up  a piece of paper on the wall saying \"A Cup of Coffee\". While we were still there, two other men  _  and ordered three cups of coffee, two on the table and one on the wall. They had two cups of coffee but  _  for three and left. This time also, the  _  did the same; he put up a piece of paper on the wall saying, \"A cup of coffee.\" It seemed that this gesture was a  _  at this place.  _  , it was something unique and puzzling for us. Since we had  _  to do with the matter, we  _  our coffee, paid the bill and left. After a few days, we again had a(n)  _  to go to this coffee shop. While we were enjoying our coffee, a man walked in. The way this man was dressed did not  _  the standard nor the atmosphere of this coffee shop. Poverty was  _  from the looks on his face.  _  he seated himself, he looked at the wall and said, \"One cup of coffee from the  _  .\" The waiter served coffee to this man with  _  and dignity. The man had his coffee and left without paying. We were amazed to watch all this when the waiter  took off  a piece of paper from the wall and threw it into the dustbin.",
