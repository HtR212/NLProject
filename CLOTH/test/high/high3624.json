    "article": "You had better learn to be grateful. If you are grateful, you naturally  _  yourself up to receive all kinds of blessings and good things in life. You can receive almost everything you want  _  . If you want recovery soon, start by feeling grateful that you are still  _  . If it is more money that you want, start being grateful for whatever  _  of money you already have.\nYou see, showing gratitude  is the key to every  _  thing in life. It is the key to successful relationships, it is the key to successful futures and it is the key to  _  healthier and happier lives. And this is where the importance of being grateful lies.  In a word  , it makes life better.\nOne of my favorite  _  is \"If you learn to appreciate more of what you already have, you will find yourself having more to appreciate.\" Think about that!\nSomething as  _  as a \"Thank you for being in my life\" or \"I  appreciate  having you here with me\", can go a long way. It will make the other person feel good, and  for sure  it also will make you feel better!\nSo maybe your wife is not very  _  around the house, but she's great at cooking your favorite  _  . Or, maybe your child  _  milk all over your new shirt right before you walked out the door for work, but usually he makes you laugh so much and makes you  feel like  the luckiest parent in the world.\nI strongly  _  you to make a promise to yourself for the next week. Decide to  wake up  every morning and think of at least 5 things that you are  _  for. Then say them out loud. You will notice a smile on your face without even  _  . In 30 days you will feel completely renewed. This is the  _  of being grateful!",
