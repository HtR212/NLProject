Sudha knew that she believed in  herself  and could realize her dream,  _  she began her courageous journey back to the world of dancing --  _  to balance, bend, stretch, walk, turn, twist and twirl. After every public recital , she  _  ask her dad about her performance. \"You  _  have a long way to go\" was the answer she used to get  in return  . In January 1984, Sudha made a historic  _  by giving a public recital in Bombay. She performed in such a great manner that it  _  everyone to tears and this  _  pushed her to the number one position again. That evening when she asked her dad the  _  question, he didn't say anything. He just touched her feet as a praise.
