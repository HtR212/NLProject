    "article": "Eighty-year-old retired tailor, James McKay, spent Saturday night in jail after  _  thirty-year-old Keith Smith over the head  _  his walking stick. McKay's wife, Laurence told us that while McKay is usually a  _  person, he had been  _  to this act of violence by getting wet just once too often. Smith lives above the McKays and it appears that not only is he a keen gardener, he is also a  _  collector. Unfortunately for him, the water he sent over his balcony every day ended up on the McKay's, or too often, on the McKays  _  . \"For the last fortnight, since Smith moved into the flat above us, we have hardly dared to go to our  _  ,\" said Laurence. She added that it wasn't so much the water falling onto their balcony from Smith watering his plant  _  bothered them, it was more the way he cleaned his fish tanks. \"We'd be  _  there happily reading our newspapers, when  _  so much water would come from above that we'd be as wet as if we'd  _  with our clothes on! Neither could we get rid of the  _  of fish!\" And on Saturday evening it was just too  _  . \"It was James's birthday,\" explained Laurence, \"and I'd made him a birthday cake. The candles were a great sight as you can imagine, but James didn't get to blow them out.\"  _  Smith emptied one of his larger tanks over his balcony and both the McKays and the cake were wet  _  . Rarely had Laurence seen McKay move so fast. \"I couldn't  _  him. He was up there in a flash. It was the fastest I'd seen him move since 1964.\" Smith is not going to take things further with the police. He has also promised to change his  _  from now on. And what of James McKay?  _  he left the police station, a large crowd of supporters sang him, \"Happy Birthday\". \"  _  the most exciting birthday  _  !\" said the cheerful old man. \"The best since my adolescence I'd say!\"",
