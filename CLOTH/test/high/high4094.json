    "article": "A boy walked along Carver Street, singing a sad song. He walked with his head down. Once he looked up and noticed the sign across the empty street, painted on the side of an old house. On the sign a big woman with yellow hair and a five-mile smile held out a big bottle. \"Coca-Cola. Drink Coca-Cola.\" the sign said. \"Boy!\" The silence was cut by a sudden cry. He turned around quickly to see who had called. An old woman was standing at her door. \"You boy! Come here this minute.\" Slowly the boy  _  onto the cold flat stones leading to the old woman's house. When he arrived at her house, she  _  out her hand and wrapped her  _  old fingers around his arm. \"Help me inside, boy,\" she said. \"Help me  _  to my bed. What's your name?\" \"Joseph,\" he said. The old woman on the bed tried to  _  up, raising berselfon her elbow . Water  _  from her eyes and mouth. The sight of her made Joseph feel  _  . \"I'm  _  , Joseph. You can see that, can't you? I want you to write a will for me. There's paper and pencil on the table there.\" Joseph looked down at the  _  , and then looked out of the window. He saw the sign again, \"Coca-Cola. Drink Coca-Cola. I want my silver pin to  _  to my daughter.\" Joseph bent his small body over the table and  _  the pencil slowly across the paper. \"There's my Bible. \"The old woman said. \"That's for my daughter, too. I want a  _  Christian burial with lots of singing. Write that down, too. That's the last -  _  of a poor old woman.\" The boy labored over the paper. Again he looked out of the window. \"Here. Bring it here so I can  _  it.\" Joseph found the Bible, and,  _  the paper inside, laid it next to the bed. \"  _  me now, boy,\" she sighed .\"I'm tired.\" He ran out of the house. A cold wind blew through the  _  window, but the old woman on the bed  _  nothing. She was dead. The paper in the Bible moved back and forth in the wind.  _  on the paper were some childish letters, which  _  the words, \"Coca-Cola. Drink Coca-Cola.\"",
