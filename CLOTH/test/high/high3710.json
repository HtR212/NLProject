    "article": "Recently I saw the same Cirque Du Soleil show twice. At the first show, my wife and I were  _  about thirty rows back from the stage, so it was not easy to see the expressions on the faces of the performers.   _  , what we were able to appreciate was the wonderful panorama  of the   _  . At the second show, we sat in the second row, just a couple of meters from the stage and we could   _  the performers' expressions carefully. Having seen the show before, we expected to see our favorite  _  again.\nWe talked about which of the two shows we   _  more and whether it was better to sit closer to the stage or   _  back. We agreed that both shows were equal  in terms of  their spectacle  and enjoyment, but from two totally different   _  . In watching the show for the second time, our   _  of the brilliance of Cirque Du Soleil show was greatly deepened.\nIt  occurred to  me that there are some similarities between the  _  we had at the two Cirque Du Soleil shows and what happens in our everyday lives.\nWe often make a decision   _  on our first impressions. For example, when we read a book for the first time, it is easy to believe that we have a   _  understanding of all that we have just read. Then if we read the book again, we will   _  any other important things that we missed the first time.\nWhile we often don't have the   _  to consider an important situation for a second time  _  we make a decision, we should always try to make time to stand back and  _  things from a distance away in order to   _  a broader perspective. We would then be in a better position to make a more   _  and considered decision about the action we should take.",
