    "article": "The students at Sandy's high school were badly shaken by the news that a classmate had  _  himself.The suicide note read: \"It's hard to  _  when nobody cares.\" Glen, a teacher, realized this was a  _  moment about the importance of making people feel  _  . He asked his class to imagine they were about to  _  and to write a note \"telling someone how and why you  _  him or her.\" Sandy, who had a  _  relationship with her mother, decided to write her  _  . Her letter read: \"We've had some  _  times and I haven't always been a very good  _  , but I know I'm lucky to have you in my life. You're the  _  person I've ever known.And even when I disagree with you, I never  _  you love me and want what's best for me.Thanks for not  _  up me.\" When her mom read the note, she cried and hugged Sandy  _  but said little. The next morning, Sandy found a  _  on her mirror: \"Dearest Sandy, I want you to know being your mother is, by far, the most important thing in my life.  _  I got your note , I thought I had lost your love and  _  . I felt like such a failure.I intended to  _  it all last night.Your note saved my  _  .\" Be careful not to underestimate the  _  of expressed appreciation. It won't always save a life, but it will always make someone's life better.",
