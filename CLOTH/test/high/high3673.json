I first went to the  information  desk, where I could get a permit to visit the patient.\n  _  I could ask which room my friend was in, the lady set down my name, age, filled out a form and  _  a bell. I was just about to tell her what I was coming for when two men arrived with a wheelchair,  _  me in it and pushed me down the hall.\n\"I'm not  _  ,\" I shouted. \"I'm just looking for a friend.\"\n\"When he comes,\" one man said, \"we'll  _  him up to your room.\"\nIn a minute I  _  myself in a small room. In no time they undressed me and covered some other things  on  me. One man said \"If you need anything, press the button.\"\n\"I want to get my  _  back.\" I begged.\n\"Oh, you can  _  us,\" a voice said, \"Even if the  _  happens, we will see that your wife will get everything.\" They left and locked the door  _  them.\nI was trying to think of how to escape by the door when Dr. Ward came in with several of his  _  .\n\"Thank God you finally came,\" I said.\n\"It hurts that badly?\" he asked.\n\"No, on the contrary, I am not ill  at al  .\"\nDr. Ward looked  _  . \"If you don't feel any pain, that means it's much more  _  than we expected.\" Then he turned to his students, \"This is the most difficult kind of patient to deal with because he refuses to  _  that he is ill.   Since   he won't tell us where it hurts, he will never be well again until we find the hurt out for  _  by doing exploratory surgery   .\"",
