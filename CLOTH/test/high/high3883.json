Bradley,   _  made his way down to the bathroom and back. Sitting back down, he   _  , \"I have muscular dystrophy , and so does my sister, who's in a   _  now.\"\nAs we descended  , he looked over, smiled, and spoke in a low, almost   _   voice, \"You know, I was really   _   about who would sit beside me on the plane.
