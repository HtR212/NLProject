    "article": "In 1990 a report was published about  _  the earth might be like 20 years from then on.The report was a result of a three-year study. According to the report, the picture of the earth in the year 2010 is not a  _  one.The world will be more  _  because the population will continue to grow.The population could be  as large as  6,300 million, almost 2,500 million more than in 1985.More people would move into cities,  _  cities in developing countries.Such cities as Cairo and Jakarta probably would  _  have 15 million by then. Food production will  _  , but not enough to feed all the people.Farmers will grow 90% more food than they did in 1985,  _  most of the increase would be in countries that  _  produce enough food for their people.  _  increase is expected in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East.Poor farming ways are  _  large areas of crop land, changing farms into deserts.More farmland is  _  as cities become larger and more houses are built.  Air pollution  will get worse as industrial countries burn more coal and oil.Many of the world's forests could disappear as more and more trees  are cut down  .Energy will continue to be a serious problem.The experts say their picture of the earth for the year 2010  may be wrong  .They only pictured the situation that  _  today.By changing the situation, by  settling  the problems, the picture can be changed.There is  _  time for nations of the world to  work out  a plan of action.But they warned that  _  too long to make decisions would greatly reduce the chances of success.",
