    "article": "We should show respect to everybody, especially our elders because they are ahead of us -- in age, in wisdom and maturity, in experience and education. Our  _  have done a lot for us, directly or indirectly and most of us  _  everything to their kindness and love. When we  _  them respect, whether it is by bowing to them, or  _  them with a smile, or offering them any help they need, it is one way of  _  our own love and gratitude to them.  _  , elders have also been through all the years you are  going through  and know a little more about the world than you do. It is  _  that you do not agree with the belief of your elders, but this is nothing new. All younger generations have always  _  with their elders and it is these differences that bring changes in human  _  . However much you disagree with them, give them credit for their  _  . With changing times and  _  influences, youngsters no longer know what is interpreted as disrespect to elders. Youngsters should  _  express their views and if there are arguments, they should not  _  their voices. If there is no space on sofas or chairs, children will immediately  give up  their places, and sit on the carpet. In buses and trains, youngsters are  _  to give up their places to older people. This is not a  _  of who has more rights. It is simply that those who are younger have the strength to bear  _  , or tolerate unpleasantness, so it is natural to show consideration to those who are older and perhaps at a  _  disadvantage. When you do simple things as a mark of respect, elders become  _  that youngsters care for them, and they respond with affection and kindness.",
