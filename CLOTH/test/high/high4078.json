Girls across the school hardly knew me. I just did not have what it took to  _  a school election. I was  _  . As I cried in my room that evening, I  _  took a deep breath and decided I wouldn't stop dreaming. I decided that I would  _  for elections again in my final year at school--and I would win. I recognized that my  _  had a lot of advantages. What strengths did I have? I had good grades, and I was  _  and helpful. And my biggest  _  was the faith I had. I would not allow my  _  appearance to hold me back from putting my best foot forward. That evening, I  _  my election plans for the next year.
