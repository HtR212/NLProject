    "article": "Tom with his friend Jack went to his favorite newspaper stand. Jack  _  the salesman selling the newspapers gently, but in return he received poor  _  . The salesman never even looked up at his customer when he  _  the late-night edition. Accepting the  _  , Jack politely smiled and wished the salesman a pleasant weekend. The salesman made an unclear sound and seemed  _  that the two men had completed their business. As the two friends walked down the street, Tom asked, \"Does he always treat you so  _  ?\" \"Yes,  _  , he does,\" Jack responded. \"And are you always so  _  and friendly to him?\" \"Yes, I am!\" Jack  _  as they turned a corner. \"Why are you so nice when he is so unfriendly to you?\" Jack  _  , \"Because I don't want him to decide how I am going to  _  .\" Who  _  how you are going to act? Is it your circumstances or the difficult people in your life that determine your  _  ? When we allow our conflicts to  _  us, we behave as if getting rid of our difficulties is our only priority.  _  , it doesn't really matter how we treat one another. For example, we'll say, \"This  _  is causing me problems right now so I don't care about exercising  _  , self-control, and loving kindness. Instead, I want to let him know how  _  I am because of his action.\" We forget our difficulties will eventually weaken. But the way we handle conflicts will influence our  _  for a long time. Will you only respond to the momentary crisis or will you be more concerned about the  _  of what kind of person you are becoming? Who decides how you will behave when the pressure is on?",
