And this supermarket held so many sweet  _  . He often came with me, and always bought me yellow roses. Standing  _  the meat, I searched for the perfect small steak  since  my husband used to love it.  _  a woman came up beside me. I watched as she picked up a large pack of T-bone steaks, dropped them in her basket,  _  , and then put them back. She turned to go and once again  _  for the pack of steaks. She saw me  _  her and she smiled. \"My husband loves T-bone steaks, but they are so expensive.\" \"My husband  _  away eight days ago,\" I told her, and  _  to control the sadness in my voice, \"Buy him the T-bone steaks. And  _  every moment you have together.\"  _  by my words, she placed the steaks in her basket and walked away  _  . But several minutes later she came towards me again,  _  a package in her arms. She was  _  the brightest smile I had ever seen. As she  _  , I saw what she held. \"These are for you,\" she placed three beautiful yellow roses in my hands. I wanted to tell her what the roses  _  for me, but, unable to speak, only watching her walking away. Looking down at the roses, I wondered  _  she knew it. Suddenly the answer seemed so  _  . I wasn't alone. There were  _  many people caring for me and willing to help me. Just be thankful for what you have and who you are.",
