    "article": "During the years when I was a teacher, I learned a lot of things. Perhaps the most important one was the life-changing  _  of encouraging words. I  _  what Leo Buscaglia had done with his students in University of Southern California. In one class Leo Buscaglia and his students had made two lists of  _  , one positive and one negative. Then they  _  the negative words in the trash and tried to use only the  _  words for one month. They were  _  at how much better their lives became just by using words full of  _  I decided to try this as well by  _  something good to write on each paper my students  handed in  . No matter how many mistakes a student's paper  _  , there was always a  _  sentence, beautiful thought, or a great idea that I could  _  on. I remember glancing over my desk and  _  some of the students reading those encouraging words  again and again  . It was a joy seeing their eyes shine a little brighter, their  _  sit up a little straighter, and their learning climb a lot  _  . I recently saw one of my  _  students and we talked for a while. He has got married, and has two children now. As I was saying goodbye, he said, \"You know I  _  have a few of those old papers. I look at them from time to time. I just  _  my kids have a good teacher like you.\" I was amazed at the  _  those few positive words had on his life. May your own life be forever full of encouraging words in your ears, from your lips and in your heart.",
