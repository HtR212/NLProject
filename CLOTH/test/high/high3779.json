The students,after    _    social statistics,talking to the boys and compiling much data ,   _    that 90 percent of the boys would spend some time in    _  .\nTwentyfive years later another group of graduate students were given the job of    _    the previous prediction. They went back to the    _    area. Some of the boys--now    _  --were still there,a few had died and some has moved away. But they managed to    _    180 of the original 200.They found that only four of the boys had ever been sent to prison.\nWhy was it that these men,who had lived in a breeding place of    _  ,had such surprisingly    _    record?The researchers were    _    told. \"Well,there was a    _  .\"\nThey investigated    _    and found that in 78 percent of the    _    it was the same woman. The researchers went to the teacher,now living in a home for    _    teacher .How had she had this remarkable    _    on that group of children?Could she give them any reason why these boys    _    her?\"No,\"she said,\"I really couldn't.\" And then,59 thinking back   over the years,she said musingly ,more to herself than to her questioners,\"I    _    these boys.\" The researchers finally realized that it was the teacher's care that made a difference.",
