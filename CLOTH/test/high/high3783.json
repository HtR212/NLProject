    "article": "A student went to college after  _  all his school examinations. There he put his name down for world geography.  _  after the first day, he did not go to  _  any more. The teacher noticed that this student was  _  absent and thought that he had changed to  another  class. He was very  _   when he saw the boy's name on the list  of students  who  wanted to take the geography examination  _   the end of the year.\nThe teacher had prepared a difficult examination paper, which covered  _  he had taught, and he was eager to see  _  this student answered the questions. He expected that his answers would be very  _  ; but when he examined his paper carefully, he found only one small mistake in them.  _   this surprised him very much, he went through the paper  twice  , but was still not able to find  more than  one mistake, so he sent  _  the student to question him about his work after the exam..\nWhen the student had  come into  the room, the teacher said to him, \"I know that you came to my class only once on the first day and that you have been absent from all the others. Yet I have found only one small mistake in your paper.  _  is that?\"\n\"Oh, I'm sorry about that mistake, sir, \"answered the student. \"After the examination, I realized  _  I ought to have written. I would not have made that mistake  _  I had been confused  by your  _   lecture.\"",
