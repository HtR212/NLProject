So without the  _  of my family, I got up in front of a group of people and got ready to  _  my poem. But I didn't expect to  _  .\nJudges were chosen from the audience by  _  a bouncy   ball thrown out into their midst   to see  _  would catch it. As it is with most  _  , performers had 2 minutes to impress the  _  who would then give a score from 0.0 to 10. There were five judges.\nI was the  _  person in the competition. I'm only 16 and everybody else was about 20-70. My poem  _  really well. People liked it and I think many were impressed by my courage to  go up  on stage and perform my own work. In the end I  _  third, but I was not disappointed.  After all  , it was only 0.3 points that separated me  _  second place.\n  _  it was all over, I was waiting in the car park for my dad to pick me up.

She said, \"Here, have the  _  , so you remember tonight\". I  _  a smile card out for the woman thanking her for her words and the ball. She was impressed by the card but no words passed between us.
