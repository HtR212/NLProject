    "article": "A small pink music box sat on grandma's dresser for many years. When I was little I would open it up and watch the ballerina  dance  _  round and round. I often  _  to the music, but when it stopped grandma let me  _  it up again. She told me it was a birthday     _  from her grandma when she was little. She also  _  like me and her grandma let her rewind it so she could dance over and over. After the dancing we would sit on the couch and pull out each  _  of the box looking at each ring, necklace and many other things she had  _  . Grandma was ninety years old and each drawer  _  many things that meant a lot to her.\nGrandma is  _  now, the music box is sitting on my dresser now. One day I took it down, opened it up and watched the ballerina dance,  _  many nice moments she and I had shared. One by one I opened the drawers and  _  touched the rings, necklaces as I had done when I was little. As I  came across  the photos of grandma and I, tears  _  down my cheek. In the bottom drawer I found a letter with my name on it: \nDear Anna,\nI love you very much. The time we spent together was the best days. I have placed the  _  memories we made in this little music box. You  _  it so much, always dancing to the music with the ballerina. I hope you \n  _  your own memories to the box and you can give it to your little girl someday.\nLove grandma\nTears came to my eyes as I put the  _  back in the drawer. I placed the music box back on the dresser. \n  _  later I'm old and lie in the hospital bed so I'll give a small wrapped  _  to my daughter. Inside a small pink music box, a small ballerina that dances round and round as  _  overflow from every drawer.",
