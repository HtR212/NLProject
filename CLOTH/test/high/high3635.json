    "article": "When I walk through the streets of San Francisco's business districts, white people stare at me as if I were a circus clown. Their staring eyes don't see that I get  _  A's in school, or that I am a captain of the football team, or that I belong to  _  youth organizations. All they see is that I am 6-foot-4, young, black, and male---a potential  _  to them. White men look at me as if I am up to no good, or as if they are  _  to me. White women just look at me with  _  , say, sometimes they cross the street when they see my friends and me coming, or walk in the street and only get back on the sidewalk after we  _  . Many people come to San Francisco to get away from the stereotypes of the cities they were born and  _  in. The majority of the blacks and Latinos who live in this city don't have that luxury. How can you feel at home when people are  _  telling you to get back to Africa or Mexico ----or just back to \"where you belong\"? My way of dealing with this kind of thing has  _  over the years. In the past, when my friends and I would walk the streets and a hundred pairs of white eyes would look at me as if we were the lowest form of dirt, it would make us angry enough to hurt or  _  them. Now I'm more likely to use  _  to defend myself against those eyes. To women who clutch their purse in terror, I'll say, \"Man, I ain't gonna do anything to you, I got money in my pocket!\" My cousin has even started wearing a T-shirt  _  in big letters, \"NO, WHITE LADY, I DON'T' WANT YOUR PURSE.\" The most painful thing is when we get those  _  stares from black people, especially elderly ones. I want o say to them, \"We're black, too. Why would we do something to you?\" Usually I react more  _  to all of this than a lot of my friends do. Some of them, so brainwashed, just think it's part of life and that there is nothing you can do. But for me, that's not good enough. I just can't stand it when every day a hundred pair of eyes tell you you're not  _  .",
