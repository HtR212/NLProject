It was really an unforgettable experience!\nBefore we set off, I thought it would be a hard job,   _   that I could not adapt to the poor living conditions. After arriving in Jaipur, we went straight to the hotel that the Center had   _   for us; a relief to us as we were tired from the   _  . During the following days we were   _   to the city and had Hindi lessons with our guide Ravi. \nOn our fourth day in Jaipur we were taken to the head office. There we were   _   for the Child Development Program and over the course we   _   two studies related to child work and child rights. We focused on the experiences of the children who were working and the   _   that pushed them into work. The experience was entirely new for me and I learned so much through the   _  . The best part of the work, however, was   _   being in the communities and interacting with the children and their parents. I was   _   to a way of life completely different from my own. In spite of the poor living situations, people in Jaipur were   _  . We found that the parents communicated openly with each other and they were always   _   to share their own thoughts and feelings with their children. I could   _   that people in Jaipur have positive relationships with their family and community members. Talking with the people there and hearing their stories was something that had a strong effect on my worldview, continuing to   _   how I understand everything around me now. I have been   _   by the people that I met through this experience.\nOn the weekends I spent time in Jaipur,   _   the city and shopping. We were   _   enough to be there during Holi, an exciting and color1ful celebration in February end or early March in India! We really   _   every minute of the life in Jaipur! \nGenerally, my practicum experience with Volunteering India was extremely   _  . I know that I will be thinking about everything that I saw, learned and   _   in India and look forward to the day that I can return to this amazing country.",
