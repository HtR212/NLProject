    "article": "In 1977, a dead author of detective stories saved the life of a 19-month-old baby in a most unusual way. The author was Agatha Christie, one of the most successful writers of detective stories in the world. In June 1977, a baby girl became seriously ill in Qatar, near Saudi Arabia. Doctors were unable to  _  the cause of her illness, so she  was flown  to London and admitted to Hammersmith Hospital, where specialist help was  _  . She was then only half-conscious and on the \"Dangerously Ill\" list. A team of doctors hurried to  examine  the baby only to discover that they,  _  , were puzzled by the very unusual symptoms. While they were discussing the baby's case, a nurse asked to  _  to them. \"Excuse me,\" said nurse Marsha Maitland, \"  _  I think the baby is  _  from thallium poisoning.\" \"  _  makes you think that?\" Dr. Brown asked. \"Thallium poisoning is extremely  _  .\" \"A few days ago, I was reading a novel called  _  Agatha Christie,\" Nurse Maitland explained. \"In the book, somebody uses thallium poison, and  all  the symptoms are  _  . They are exactly the same as the baby's.\" \"You're very observant and you may be right,\" another doctor said. \"We'll  carry out  some tests and find out  _  it's thallium or not.\" The  _  showed that the baby had  _  been poisoned by thallium, a rare metal used in making optical glass.  Once  they knew the cause of illness, the doctors were able to give the correct treatment. The baby soon  recovered  and was sent back to Qatar. Inquiries showed that the poison  might have come  from an insecticide used in Qatar.",
