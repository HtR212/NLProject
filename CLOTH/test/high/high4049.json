    "article": "I was walking down the road one day when my cell phone rang. A strange  _  on the other end spoke to me, \"Dad, please come back soon. I miss you so much!\" I judged that it was a  _  number. A little while later, the call came once again, so I rudely  _  , \"You've dialed the wrong number!\" and then  hung off  . During the following days, I got the same  _  now and then. But I didn't care much about it. Then one day she constantly called me  even though  I didn't answer. Finally I answered the phone and heard a weak voice, \"Dad, please come back. I miss you so much! Dad, I'm  _  so much pain! Mom said you were too busy to take  _  of me. But, dad, please  _  me again, OK?\" The innocent  _  was difficult to refuse. I made a  _  kiss on the phone and heard the weak voice say, \"Thank you...Dad, I am so...happy, so...happy...\" Shortly after this, I became  _  about who had been on the other end of my phone. So I called back, and a woman answered, \"Sorry, sir. I am really sorry to have  _  you. My daughter has suffered from bone cancer  _  she was born. And her father... died in an  _  a short while ago. I dare not tell her this sad  _  . Poor baby.When she couldn't bear the painful chemotherapy , she would cry for her dad, who had always  _  her. I really couldn't bear it, so I gave her a random phone number...\" \"How is your daughter now?\" I couldn't  _  to ask. \"She's  _  . You must have kissed her on the phone, because she passed away with a smile, tightly holding the cell phone...\"  _  filled my eyes and I was so sad to hear that.",
