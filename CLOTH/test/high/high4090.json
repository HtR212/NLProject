Although  _  still beat the windshield of her SUV , the worst of the day's storm seemed to have passed as she  _  her 11-year-old daughter, Maddie, home at 8:30 pm.\nMaddie  _  in front, while two young kids sat strapped into their SUV  _  in back. Driving along the mud by a river, McRae, 39,  _  a terrifying sight: The road just ahead had been craved in and  taken away  . She stepped heavily on the brake. The SUV  _  into a flooded hole some 6 metres below, and was washed into the  _  , which the storm had turned into a  _  river 30 metres wide. Rocks and fallen tree  _  knocked into her SUV, making it upside down. The pressure blew out the window.\nNo one was hurt,  _  there was no way to escape either, The SUV was being  _  towards the middle of the river, about 400 metres away. McRae  _  helplessly and prayed aloud with Maddie: \"Please, God, please, help us!\" The SUV, submerged and  _  with water, came to a stop when it parked at an angle in a logjam .\nIt was Maddie who took control. Pushing her way out of the  _  back window, the slight but athletic Maddie  _  onto the top of the SUV, which had righted itself, and yelled to her mother to hoist up the younger children. Soon the  _  were crowded on the top of the SUV's roof.  _  to hold on as the water swept over them. McRae caught hold of the two-year-old kid to her chest while holding the three-year-old on her leg. Both children were so  _  that MeRac wondered if they were all right. With her mother's permission, the 11-year-old girl-Meddie got over lots of problems to ask for help in a  _  village and fortunately they were saved.",
