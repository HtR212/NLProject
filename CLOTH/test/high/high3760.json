    "article": "We often see hitchhikers , standing by the side of the road, thumb sticking out, waiting for a lift. But it is getting  _  nowadays. What killed hitchhiking?  _  is often mentioned as a reason. Movies about murderous hitchhikers and real-life crime  have put  many drivers off picking up hitchhikers.  _  no single women picked me up on my journey to Manchester  no doubt  reflects the safety fear:  a large  , strangely dressed man is seen as dangerous.\nBut the reason may be  _  complex: hitchhiking happens where people don't have cars and transport services are  _  . Plenty of people  _  hitchhike in Poland and Romania. Perhaps the rising level of car ownership in the UK means the few people lift hitchhiking are usually considered strange. Why can't they  _  cars? Why can't they take the coach or the train?\nThree-quarters of the UK population have  access to  a car; many of the  _  will be quite old. The potential hitchhiking population is therefore small.  _  my trip proves it's still possible to hitchhike. The people who picked me up were very interesting lawyer, retired surgeon, tank commander, carpenter, man who live in an isolated farmhouse and a couple  living up  in the mountains. My conclusion is that only really interesting people are mad enough to pick up fat blokes  in red, spotted scarves. Most just wanted to do someone a good turn; a few said they were so surprised to see a hitchhiker that they couldn't help  stopping  .\nThe future of hitchhiking most  _  lies with car-sharing organized over the Internet, via sites such as hitchhikers. org. But for now, you can still stick your thumb out (actually, I didn't do much of that,  _  just to hold up my destination sign) and people--wonderful, caring, sharing, unafraid people--will stop.\nIn the UK, with its cheap  _  and reasonable rail service, I don't think I'll make a habit of it. But having enjoyed it so much, I'm ready now to do a big trip  _  Europe and beyond. In the 1970s a female friend of my wife's hitchhiked to India. How wonderful it would be to have another go,  _  Afghanistan might be a challenge. I wish I'd got that tank commander's mobile number.",
