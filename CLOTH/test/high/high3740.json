    "article": "When most of my friends were quarreling with their fathers, I was looking to mine for guidance. He knows  _  about me than anyone else. He  _  for work so he's gone a lot. Most people assume we have a  _  relationship because he's not at home very often. But we get along well under this situation  _  we talk every night by phone, and he makes his support known when he can't be present. One night my world just collapsed, and  _  was my dad who was able to pick up the pieces. My first true love called from a party and  _  my heart. He offered little explanation and this made the  _  more difficult to accept. In that quick phone call I lost my boyfriend and best friend, a  _  I had enjoyed for the past year and a half. I was sure I was the most miserable fifteen-year-old girl in the world--lost and  _  . It felt like everyone else's life could just continue on in its normal way, but mine couldn't. I was forced to deal with my regular  _  on Monday morning, as Mom went to work, Dad flew out  _  business and I went to school. Dad wouldn't return until Friday. I wasn't sure  _  I was going to face everyone and their  _  at school. I was right:the questions and the whispers started around the second period. I returned home from school feeling  _  defeated. All I wanted to do was crawling into bed and wallowing (......) in my own self-pity. I pulled back the covers on my bed and  _  a pile of cards left by my dad. Each card included a(n)  _  . He was halfway across the country and still my dad was able to show he  _  . I made it through that week because of him. Each card seemed to say just what I needed to hear. I was instructed to open the last  _  after the party I went to on Saturday night. In it he sagely reminded me to  _  .\"The world isn't so bad after a good laugh. The more you laugh, the more you heal.\"Each card was  _  , Love, Dad.",
