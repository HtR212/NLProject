    "article": "The tourist bus winded its way into a mountainous area. When it was  _  to make a turn, two passengers,   _  of young lovers, were so attracted by the beautiful scenery that they  called for  a stop to get down. They were left behind and the bus went  _  . Suddenly they heard a loud boom  _  of the road. It was a huge rock rolling down in the landslide that hit the bus and fell with it into a deep valley. The lovers were greatly  _  by the news that no passengers on board  _  . When they calmed down they  _  and expressed their feelings in a few words.\nThe above story was told by a guide when we were riding a tourist  _  to a beautiful mountain. He asked us to guess what the lovers said  _  after the disaster that they had narrowly escaped.\nOften we read reports about traffic accidents, among which there were  _  ones who missed the bus and  _  the disaster. Those people usually said with a sigh of  _  \"Fortunately I was not on board.\" On our bus the passengers'  _  to the guide were various.\nBut the answer was quite out of our expectation. \"If we hadn't got down and  _  the bus, it would have  _  the dangerous spot and all the passengers would have survived.\"\nThe story passed from person to person as a sort of wit   test, but I think  _  . It actually serves as a(n)  _  of a person's mind. I pay my heart-felt respect to the couple who, instead of feeling lucky,  _  themselves for causing the loss of lives. People all have heart for  _  , but it is often a flashing thought across one's mind that decides whether it is good or evil  .",
