Although he's   _   with the decrease in his earnings compared with last year, he feels fortunate that he has   _   a contract with a processing company that   _   a competitive price.   _   he not done this, Zhu might have been   _   serious losses, in common with many other growers this year.\n\"I heard that a lot of growers have   _   losses this year. To be honest, I feel lucky because   at least   I didn't lose money,\" said Zhu, from Zhangli Village in the city of Laiwu in East China's Shandong Province.\nCurrently,70 percent of the area   _   with ginger in Laiwu is jointly developed by farmers and enterprise,  according to   the deputy head of this district.\nZhu   _   6,000 kilograms(kg) of ginger produced on his 1,330 square meters of farmland to a local company   _   a price of 1.4 yuan (22 cents) a kg in mid-October. In doing so, he didn't earn much money but   _   manage to balance his costs of around 8,000 yuan.\nIn recent years, Chinese farmers have often suffered from the severe price turbulence  that has   affected   crops such as ginger, garlic and mung beans. The uncertainties have   _   them to seek new ways to avoid losses   _   by price fluctuations.\nThe price of ginger has   _   rapidly in recent years, prompting an increasing number of farmers to grow the crop.   _  , in late October it fell by more than 70 percent,   compared   with the same period in 2010.\nIn Laiwu, a major production base for ginger, farmers have   _   to form a targeted sales relationship with the processing companies as insurance against the   _   of fluctuating  prices.",
