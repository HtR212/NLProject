None of the creatures living there knew what daylight looked like.\nOne day, all of the animals of the forest gathered together in a clearing. They     _    if it would be better to37 _ in darkness, or if it would be better to also have     _  . Deer, Chipmunk , Raccoon , Wolf, Bear,and many other creatures  _  to the top of the highest mountain. The mountain stood so  _  that there were no trees on its top,and it was  _  only with rocks. Millions of  _  blinked in the dark sky overhead. The biggest and most powerful animal in the  _  was the bear, and he was the first to   _  the mountaintop. Bear stood on the highest peak, looked out  _  the forest below,and argued for remaining in darkness because there would be no light to keep them   _  .Most of the other animals were afraid, and they argued with Bear. Raccoon said that he did not  _  the darkness because he was so smart that he could find plenty of food, even in the dark. Wolf was easy to please,too. She didn't mind the darkness because she could howl in darkness or in light.\nBut one animal   _  stand up to Bear. Chipmunk, the smallest of the animals,     _  that it would be  _  to have both light and dark. Chipmunk was very clever. As Bear  _  to argue for darkness, she made many good arguments for light.\nSlowly, the night  _  . Bear grew tired of talking, but Chipmunk chattered on and on, as if she had all of the energy in the world. As the other animals   _   off to sleep, one by one, Chipmunk kept arguing. Finally, the   _  sunrise ever seen by the animals appeared over the top of the mountain. They woke up and were  _  by what they saw and regretted that they hadn't seen the sun earlier.",
