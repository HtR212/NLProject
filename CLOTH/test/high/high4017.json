She believes the dog was trying to help the poor baby.\n\"I believe Luke found it, picked it   _   and brought it. There was no trauma you could tell he injured the baby,\" she said.\nExperts have determined that the newborn was a girl.\n\"We don't know  _   the baby came from,\" Police Captain Dexter Nelson told KFOR. \"If it was born in the area outside or if someone brought the baby out there to throw it away.\"\nMedical experts are trying to determine if the baby was born alive or   _  .\nAccording to KOCO, Luke typically wandered over a large area, which officials are now seeking   _  original place about the dead baby.\nAll 50 states have some form of \"safe shelter\" law   _  that allow parents -- or someone with a parent's   _   -- to leave a newborn without a name at special   _  places but can get away with the action.\nThe details of such   _  are different from state to state.
