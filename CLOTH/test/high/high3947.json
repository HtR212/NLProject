The storm had moved directly  _  his two-story wooden house. Then he heard the smoke alarm beeping. Sibson rushed down the stairs barefoot to  _  ; he opened the door to the basement , and flames  _  out. Sibson ran back upstairs to call 911 from his bedroom. \"I felt  _  because the room had a separate outdoor stairway,\" he explains. But the phone didn't work, and when he tried to go down the outdoor stairway, he was  _  by a wall of flames. Sibson realized he was trapped . Sibson's house was three kilometers  _  the main road and was so well hidden by trees that he knew calling for help would be  _  . Up a hill nearby lived Sibson's neighbor, Huggons. He was lying in bed when something like a smoke alarm  _  his ears. He jumped out of bed, took his  _  and flashlight, and headed down the hillside toward the  _  . That was when he saw the rolling heavy smoke. Huggons dialed 911, and the operator warned him not to  _  the house. But Huggons said, \"There is no way I am going to listen to Sibson  _  and die in that fire.\" \"Anyone there?\" Huggons called out. Then he heard \"Help! I'm trapped!\" coming from the second floor balcony . He entered the house, but soon had to run back to catch his  _  . After one more  _  inside the house, Huggons gave up and  _  around back. The wind parted the smoke just  _  for him to catch sight of Sibson. But there was no way to get to him. He  _  the flashlight into the woods and noticed a ladder. He took it over to the balcony and  _  Sibson down just as the second floor of the house fell off. Sibson is still  _  when he tells the story. \" I was alone that night,\" he says. \"Then I heard the most beautiful sound in my life. It was Huggons.\"",
