    "article": "eBooks still some way away from students Twelve-year-old Tang Yin is one of the earliest students to test a digital textbook in China. The boy said he was a little  _  when he received the monochromatic flat device in April, 2010, because he thought it should be a \"  _  cool\" laptop. But Tan still cherishes his new equipment like \"protecting my  _  ,\" said the fifth grader. After all, not every student has the opportunity to  _  the eBook, which is worth $294 (Y=2,000 ), he said. The 50 eBooks,  _  by Taiwan eBook manufacturer Chuanqi Photoelectric Technology in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province, enables one class at Yangzhou Sanyuanqiao Elementary School to be the  _  group of students in the Chinese mainland to replace their regular textbooks with electronic ones. Out of 1000 students, Tang's class was the lucky  recipients  . \"Our school could not  _  the project without the company's donation,\" said Yuan Shishan, vice-headmaster of the primary school.  Although  the digital book is considered environmentally friendly, because it replaces paper books and saves money in the long run, the price is much higher than most Chinese  _  can afford. Also, some technical defects, the  _  of taking notes and monochromatic display, make the eBook fail to meet the expectations of students and teachers. \"There's still a/an  _  way to go before the eBook really plays an important role in education,\" said the headmaster. According to Yuan, the annual average income of a  _  family in Yangzhou is about 20,000 to 30,000 , and neither the parents nor the school can afford the 2,000  _  book. The school doesn't allow the students to take their eBooks to their homes. The devices are  handed in  after class, and are locked in the headmaster's office.",
