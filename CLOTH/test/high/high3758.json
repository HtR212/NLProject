I pulled on it\nand an access panel to the attic   was suddenly opened. I grabbed a   _  and\nheaded up.\nI   _  into\na space above the workshop. As my eyes  _  to the\ndark, I saw a metal container. I opened it and could not believe my  _  ; several rolls of money tied up in  _  thread.\nMy God, I thought, I've found $ 800.\n  _  there was more than one box of money, I found another seven full boxes of money.

But I knew the right thing was to  _  the\nmoney to its previous owner. So I called them and asked them to drop by.\nThey were   _  , of course, not only about the money but also about that I was returning\nit.

I like to think he did it\nfor his  _  .\nThere were balls of that orange there'd still  _  on the wall of the workshop when we  _  in .I used them to tie up Christmas presents for my kids last\nyears.
