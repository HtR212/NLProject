The woman  pointed to  a little boy in a red coat and said: \"That is my son   _  is moving smoothly down the slide  \". \"What a lovely boy!\" the man replied. Then he went   _  saying, \"That is my daughter on the bike. She is   _  a white dress\".\nAfter a while, the man looked at his   _  and called to the girl in white, \"Shall we go home, Mary?\" \"Only five   _  minutes, Dad, please?\" little Mary cried. The man   _  and Mary went on riding her bike happily. Five minutes passed soon. The father  stood up  and called again to his daughter: \"It's time   to go  now, Mary?\" Again, Mary pleaded  , \"Give me more minutes, Dad.   _  five more minutes, OK?\" The man smiled and said: \"OK.\"\nThe   _  responded, \"You are surely a patient father.\"   _  in thought, the man said nothing. However, after a   _  , he smiled and then said: \"Her elder brother Tom was killed by a   _  driver last year while he was riding his bike near here. I never   _  much time with Tom and now I would give anything for just five more minutes with him. I wouldn't make the same   _  with Mary. She thinks she has five more minutes to ride her bike. The   _  is that I get five more minutes to watch her play. Life sometimes   _  too suddenly. \"\nYes, life is all about making priorities  , and what are your priorities? Don't always   _  excuses for your not being able to accompany your family members or your friends. Give someone you are   devoted to  five more minutes of your time today!",
