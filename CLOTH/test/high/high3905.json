John was presented with his award at a ceremony which recognized the  _  of the ten people who have saved the life of others. John had been studying in his room when he heard  _  . When he and his father rushed outside, they  _  that Anne Slade, mother of three, had been stabbed  _  with a knife by her ex-boyfriend . The man ran from the  _  and left Ms Slade lying in her front garden  _  very heavily. Her hands had almost been cut off. It was John's quick  _  and knowledge of first aid that saved Ms Slade's life. He immediately asked a number of the  _  people for bandages , but when nobody could put their hands on anything, his father got some tea towels and  _  from their house. John used these to dress the most severe  _  to Ms Slade's hands. He slowed the bleeding by applying pressure to the wounds until the  _  and ambulance arrived. \"I'm  _  of what I did but I was just doing what I had been  _  ,\" John said. John had taken part in the Young Lifesaver Scheme at his high school. When  _  John, Mr Alan Southerton, Director of the Young Lifesaver Scheme, said, \"  _  is no doubt that John's quick thinking and the first aid  _  that he had learned at school saved Ms Slade's life. It shows that a simple knowledge of the first aid can make a real  _  .\" John and the nine other lifesavers also attended a  _  reception yesterday hosted by the Prime Minister before  _  their awards last night.",
