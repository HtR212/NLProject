I filled up the first twenty  _  quickly, but then began to think carefully. Eventually I  _  items I've thought about for years, and  _  I've carried with me since I was young.When I  _  he list later, some entries surprised me. First, I want to  _  much more, particularly now that my children are  _  and can go with me to see the world.I would like to take them to bike through Denmark and camp in the Canadian Rockies. I'm also surprised to  _  some things on the list that need to be done soon.If I'm going to learn to roller-blade ,  for instance  , I'd better start before I turn 50.

Thanks to my  _  , I'm working on some big docks.",
