    "article": "As I walked down the hall on the last day of the school year, I watched wide-eyed as my fellow students   _   their drawers into the dustbins in front of the hall. Paper flew in all directions; broken shelves were   _   everywhere.\nSuddenly, I came up with an idea: my school really needed a   _   programme. I believed that one person could make a   _  , so I wrote out my recycling   _  . As I told the schoolmaster about my   _  , my heart was beating wildly.\nWith her agreement and encouragement, I would   _   cardboard boxes in the library, offices and classrooms to   _   papers, magazines and newspapers.\nThat night, I designed a dozen   _   and planned to arrive at school early to stick them up and hand out   _   to classrooms on Monday. But when I arrived, I was very disappointed-the night-watchman had   _   down all of the cardboard boxes I had saved. I was so upset. I began searching for other boxes, but I met with   _   success.\nA few days later,   _  , my English teacher took me into the new computer lab, and before my eyes sat a   _   of cardboard boxes. I am sure I was the   _   person in the world when I saw these boxes. These were the boxes that the new computers had arrived in, and they were the   _   size.\nI rolled my recycling rubbish bins to the dining room, stuck up my posters, and   _  made an announcement   _   the loudspeaker, letting the whole school know they now had a(n)   _   about what would happen to their unwanted papers, cans and bottles.\nSince that day, recycling has become part of everyday life at my school. Students and teachers now take active   _   to save trees and other natural resources.",
