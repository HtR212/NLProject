    "article": "My husband, a simple man, has a favorite saying: \"A bargain is really a bargain when you don't buy it\".  _  he sets aside his simple ways when we dine out. Unlike his relatives who enter a restaurant armed with calculators to make sure they never  _  , my husband  _  5 percent each time the accepted tip standard increases. He hasn't analyzed why he tips so generously, but I think the habit  _  from his high school years, when he worked as a busboy and got tips from people he served. Over the years, out growing boys would suggest that Dad let them  _  dessert rather than tip so much. He stood firm  _  their strong demands. Our sons and I have  _  to accept his habit. We recently  _  our son's girlfriend to seafood. We chose a restaurant near Cocoa Beach. Our server, a grandmotherly woman  _  at the artof service, flew around the restaurant serving dishes and drinks  _  treating customers enthusiastically. She remembered their special  _  , likes and dislikes. She didn't serve us  _  food. She served us the best food. She made sure the kitchen gave her fresh produce. At the end of the meal, our waitress  _  the bill, then went to  _  to the growing crowd of other diners. My husband paid with a credit card and added her tip. When we left, \"Mr. Goldsmith!\"she called waving a receipt at him, \"Thank you.\" \"What did you give her?\"I asked, wondering if he had done something  _  or made acalculation error. \"She gave us great service. I just thought she deserved a big  _  in tips.It wasn't until later when I overheard our son retelling the story of the grateful waitress that I realized she had given my family something  _  a thank you. She showed our son the  _  of recognizing hard work. Her show of gratitudehelped a dad earn a bit more  _  from a loving son. And it reminded me just why I married this  _  , caring man.",
