    "article": "Just once I would like to see a celebration of life instead of a gathering of death. A celebration  _   stories are told, laughter rings out, and as the speaker  _    his or her loving tribute , the person they are   _   rises from their chair and gives them the biggest bear hug! Wouldn't that be   _   ! \nI now have a stronger  _    to tell those around me how much they mean to me. I am going to let my wife   _   just how loved and appreciated she is, not only by my  _  , but also by my actions. I am going to  _   Batman with my four-year-old more often, and in the middle of our romping .I am going to grab him, hug him  _   , and tell him how thankful I am that he is my  _  .     \nEach day I will make a   _   to tell both of my boys how much I love them,  _   they are four or eighteen! From there, I am going to let family and friends know the tremendous impact they have  _   on my life. Finally, I am going to let the high school   _  I coach know that I look forward to each and every minute that I get to   _   with them in the gym.\nDon't let another day  go by   by without letting that person know. There is something special about a written letter that  _   feelings of love towards another. I don't know about you, but I have letters and cards from people that I have  _  for years, and from time to time, I get them out and re-read them.They can turn a(n)  _  day into one where I realize just how blessed and lucky I am.  Life is too   _  to leave kind words unsaid. The words you say, or the letter you write, might just make all the difference in the world.",
