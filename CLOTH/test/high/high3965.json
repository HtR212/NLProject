    "article": "Mrs. Green was over seventies, but she still drove her old car like a woman half her age. She loved driving very fast, and was proud of the  _  that she had never, in her thirty-five years of driving, been punished  _  a driving offence(, ). Then one day she nearly  _  her record. A police car  _  her, and the policeman in it saw her  _  a red light without stopping. Of course, she was stopped. It seemed  _  that she would be punished. When Mrs. Green came up to the  _  , he looked at her seriously and said that she was  _  old to drive a car, and that the  _  why she had not stopped at the red  _  was most probably that her eyes had become weak  _  old age, so that she had simply not seen it. When the judge had finished what he was  _  , Mrs. Green opened the big handbag she was  _  and took out her sewing. Without saying a word, she  _  a needle with a very small eye, and threaded it at her first attempt. When she had  _  done this, she took the thread out of the needle again and handed  _  the needle and the thread to the judge, saying, \"Now it is your  _  . I suppose you drive a car, and that you are quite sure about your own eyesight. \" The judge took the  _  and tried to thread it. After half a dozen tries, he had still not succeeded. The case against Mrs. Green was  _  , and her record  _  unbroken.",
