    "article": "Most people make tree houses using a pile of wood, a hammer, and some nails. Mitchell Joachim, an architect from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has a(n)  _  vision. He pictures a day when homes will be created from  living trees  .\nJoachim's vision  is based on  an idea called pleaching  , where tree branches are grown so that they  _  weave together. Since the growth patterns of trees are  _  by wind and sunlight, it may be  _  to control the way a tree develops.\nThese Fabricated Tree House Habitats would use trees grown into shapes as housing. One of the  _  of these designs is that trees would not have to be cut down  for wood  .\n\"A 100 percent tree houses would take  years  to create,\" Joachim said.  Depending on  the climate, a house could take anywhere from 5 to 30 years to grow. Fortunately, there's a way to  speed up  the process. Joachim suggests including  _  materials such as sod  , grasses and living branches in the housing designs. \"This material would be able to move  _  the house grows,\" Joachim said.\nA home would become an actual ecosystem. The trees would also give off water vapor that would assist in  _  the homes. Solar panels and wind would help provide  _  .The tree homes might even have soil pockets,  _  plants could grow from the structure itself.\nWork has already  _  on Joachim's first design--a house made from 15 percent recycled and 15 percent living things. Joachim is confident about the  _  of his work, as he uses natural products  without destroying  nature.\n\"The environment and its study are very important. We need to respect nature, don't  take it for granted  ,\" he said.",
