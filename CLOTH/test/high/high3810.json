He was very   _  because he couldn't keep his friends. He asked his father why this\nwas so. His father  _  replied, \"Son, each time\nyou say or do something that  _  one of your friends, hammer\n  a piece of wood into the   _  .\"\nThe curious boy did as he was told and soon he made fence   out of the wood.\n   \"Father!\" he cried, \"I can't get out! I am blocked by this fence!\"\n   \"Well, Son, each time you say something   _  to a friend, you can take one piece of wood out.\"\n   The boy   _  this, too. On the first\nday he took out one piece of wood and on the second day he took out another\ntwo. On the third day he took out some more. Finally he had  _  all of the wood. \"But Father!\" he cried again, \"Look at the  _  in the ground! They are big and dark! Oh, how ugly!\"\n   \"Son,\" his father said, \"this is why you aren't able to   _  your friends. Remember: when you hurt someone's feeling, no matter\nwhat you do to  _  up for it, there will always be a\nscar   in his  _  .\"\n   From that day on, the boy was very  _  of\nhis words and actions and he never hurt his friends' feelings again.\n   I always keep this story close to my heart. It has  _  me lot. I am always careful not to hurt any of my friends because\nthey are people that I wouldn't want to  _  .",
