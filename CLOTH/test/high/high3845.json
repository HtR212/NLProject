    "article": "Flood damage cleanup is an unforgettable experience for me. I have seen a number of news reports on television showing houses that have been  _  by natural flooding and how the different  _  there are coping and starting their flood damage cleanup. I have always felt  _  for the families that have become victims of flooding however I couldn't imagine what they were  _  because I have never experienced flooding or flood damage cleanup at first  _  until two years back. My  _  experience happened when I woke up early one morning because of the  _  of water. As I started to get out of bed to turn on the light, I felt cold muddy water at my  _  . I then realized that the power was  _  . This probably happened due to the heavy  _  and strong wind that were brought by a hurricane during the  _  . As the rains stopped, I decided to do my flood damage cleanup  _  . Because I had only moved in the house and had only  _  a few belongings, the amount of damage was  _  . It involved only washing shoes and bags  _  soap and water. It was a good thing that most of my things were  _  inside plastic buckets and most of the furniture that I bought was made of  _  and plastic. This made my flood damage cleanup a lot easier. My cleanup work only  _  the removal of mud from the apartment floors. It was also a good thing that the  _  had hardwood floors. Had the apartment been covered with carpet, I would have had to  _  a lot having the carpet cleaned if not replaced with a new one.",
