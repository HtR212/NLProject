    "article": "When I was a little boy, I would play outside for hours on sunny summer days and then have a deep and peaceful sleep at night. Sometimes, I'd have some vivid dreams, making me  _  for a moment. I would stare out into the darkness to see if anything was there and then  _  over and go back to sleep. I can still remember a few times when I woke up,  _  out into the darkness, and actually  _  someone there. It was Mom  _  over me as I slept. Each time she  _  told me to go back to sleep and I closed my eyes again, feeling  _  and loved.\nI  _  asked Mom why she watched me sleep from time to time, but  _  seeing my own children  grow up  so fast, I think I know why. She wanted to catch a moment in time and  _  it in her heart forever. I just  _  that she carried a lot of those moments with her into Heaven when she  passed away  at only 55.\nLast night I was sleeping lightly  _  I suddenly felt someone near me. I opened my eyes and saw Mom's  _  standing in the room, smiling at me. And then she was gone.\nNow  _  may say that this was just a dream, a wish or part of an old  _  . To me, though, it was  _  that Mom's loving spirit was still watching over me. To me, it was evidence enough to know that one day I would be  _  with her and everyone I have ever loved.\nTrust in their love. Know that your own life can be full of  _  , too. Then joyfully go out and live it with a brave heart and a smiling soul.",
