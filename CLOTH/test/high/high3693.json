He was Father Time, traveling forever, and the bag he  _  was filled with Tomorrows, all struggling to get out. Each  _  at twelve o'clock, he opened the bag and  _  a Tomorrow, just one, with its wings of  _  , and its shining feathers rose with hope.All the rest were kept  _  by Time's strong hands and pushed  _  in the bag. Down flew the Tomorrow  _  its lovely feathers, but as it touched the  _  , off fell its blue wings and it changed to a(n)  _  white bird which could not fly.It had become a Today.Everyone knows that Today isn't as  _  as Tomorrow, for Today can be held in one's  _  , accepted, unloved, but Tomorrow is full of mystery and beauty.It is  _  by all the world.Even those with  _  hope sigh, \"Tomorrow may bring a(n)  _  .Tomorrow's life will be different.\" Everybody tried to  _  the Tomorrow before it fell to the ground.They thought if they  _  beforehand what the Tomorrow carries, they could  _  for it.So they put great nets on the trees, seeking to catch one  _  it changed his feather.Yet although they tried every means, the birds  _  and flew to the ground as Todays.",
