She told me that she had  _  it in advance to make sure it would arrive at my house weeks before the  _  . Christmas was drawing near, but no package arrived. Cathy checked the tracking number every  _  with Canada Post, and every evening she would call me to  find out  if there was any sign of it on our end. The  _  always started with questions about the package, but twenty minutes later we would still be  _  . We talked about our family, such as parents, our kids,  _  and so on. Of course we also talked about our jobs. We had never made so much  _  for each other! The talk always took us back to the hours we spend together in our childhood. By Christmas Eve we finally had to  _  the fact that the package was  _  lost. On Christmas morning, Cathy got on the phone with everyone in my  _  and told them what she had sent. Later on, after a big Christmas dinner, I had forgotten all about the  _  package when there was a knock on the door. Who could it be at such a time? As I  _  the door, a man was standing there. \"I  _  this is yours.\" he said, holding a package. Just then I  _  that it had been delivered to the wrong address. \"I just got home from vacation,\" he explained, \"  _  I wanted you to have this in time to open for Christmas.\" I thanked this  _  stranger for taking so much trouble to  _  this gift to us on Christmas Day, and  _  thanked God that the package had been lost in the first place. The real gift that holiday season was the new  _  to my sister who lives far away from us. Now there's one gift I never want to give back!",
