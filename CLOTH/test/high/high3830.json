She makes such good use of her other   _  that she rarely gives the impression she's   _   anything.\nOne day,my six-year-old daughter Kayla went to play at her home. When Kayla came home, she was Very   _   about her day. She told me they had baked cookies, played games and done art projects. But she was   _   excited about her finger-painting project.\"I learned how to   _   colors today! Blue and red make purple, and yellow and blue make green! And Michelle   _   with us.She said she likes the way the paint feels through her fingers.\" said Kayla.\nSomething about my child's excitement caught my  _  , and I realized that I had never finger-painted with Kayla. As a result, my child had learned about   _  from a blind friend.\nI realized Kayla didn't know that Michelle was blind. It had just never   come up   in conversation. When I told her, she didn't   _   me at first. \"But Mommy, Michelle understand exactly what was in my   _  !\" Kayla insisted. \"Michelle told me that my picture shouwed joy,   _   and a sense of accomplishment. She really   _  what I was doing!\"Kayla said she had never felt how good finger-painting was   _  Michelle taught her. I knew my child was   _   ---- Michelle had listened to Kayla when she   _   her artwork. Michelle had also   _   Kayla express her pride in her work, and she excitement at her   _   of the way colors blend.\nWe were   _   for a minute. Then Kayla said slowly, \"You know, Mommy, Michelle really did 'see' my picture. She just used my   _  .\"\nYes, she uses a special type of \"vision\" that all mothers coule use.",
