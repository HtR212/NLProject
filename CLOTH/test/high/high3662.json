    "article": "Many years ago  my dad was diagnosed   with a terminal illness . He was unable to work at 41 a steady  job . He would be fine for quite a while , but would then fall suddenly 42 _  and have to be admitted to the hospital .\nHe wanted to do something to keep himself 43 _  , so he decided to volunteer at the local children 44 _  . My dad loved kids . He would talk to them and play with them .Sometimes , he would 45 _  one of his kids . In certain instances , he would give 46 _  to the sad parents of these children .\nOne of his kids was a girl who had been admitted with a 47 _  disease that paralyzed (...) her from the neck down . I don't know the 48 _  of the disease , but I do know that it was very sad for a little girl . My dad decided to try to help her . He started 49 _  her in her room , bringing paints , brushes and paper . He stood the paper up 50 _ a backing , put the paintbrush in his mouth and began to paint . He didn't use his hands at all . Only his51 _  would move . He would visit her 52 whenever  he could and paint for her . All the while he would tell her , \"see , you can do 53 _  you set your mind to .\"\n54 _  , she began to paint using her mouth , and she and my dad became friends . Soon after , the little girl was discharged  . My dad also 55 left  the children hospital for a little while because he became ill. Sometime later after my dad had recovered and 56 _  to work , he was at the volunteer counter one day and 57 _  the front door open . In came the little girl who had been paralyzed , but this time she was 58 _  . She ran straight to my dad and hugged him really tight . She gave my dad a picture she had done using her 59 _  . At the bottom it read, \"thank you for helping me walk .\"       Sometimes love is more 60 _  than doctors , and my dad-who died just a few months after the little girl gave him the picture-loved every single child in that hospital .",
