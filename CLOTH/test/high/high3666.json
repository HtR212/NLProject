    "article": "I grew up on a farm outside Port Clinton,Ohio.I was the youngest son,with four brothers and four sisters,plus a girl my folks took in.By the late 60s,most of us were  _  and had families of our own.One day,  _  we were visiting my parents in late summer or early fall,Dad mentioned he'd  _  wanted a Crimson King maple tree for the yard.Mom agreed that they were pretty.\n              Like many parents,mine were  _  to shop for something,so I  _  this was a great  _  \nto get them something they'd appreciate.I also thought if they wanted one tree,two would be even better.I  _  the price at work and decided it was a bit more than I could  _  -but all of my siblings agreed to give a hand.\n              In northern Ohio,we don't plant maple trees at Christmas,so we decided to surprise Mom and Dad with a  _  Christmas in October before the ground froze.We asked my aunt  _  she'd help us with the deception ,and she called my parents in  _  to say she was coming for a Sunday visit.Then my sisters and sisters-in-law went into  _  ,planning a big holiday turkey dinner.\n              On the  _  Sunday,we all met at my house and loaded the trees in a pickup truck,I  dressed up  as Santa Claus.Then off we went,nine or 10 cars  _  with people and food,plus the pickup.\n              When the caravan 56 arrived at my folks' house,Dad came rushing out of the back door, convinced something was  _  .He and Mom were  _  when we told them why we were there.\n              When Christmas  rolled around  ,of course,we couldn't go to our parents' house empty handed,so Mom and Dad got double presents that year.Almost half a century later,I still drive by the old farmstead and smile when I see those big,handsome  _  and remember giving a special gift to special people on Christmas in October.",
