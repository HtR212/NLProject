    "article": "Cheerful Charlie was a very special boy. When he was still in his mother's tummy, she had an accident, which meant that Charlie couldn't walk. But that had never been a(n)  _  for him; they had started calling him Cheerful Charlie because of his joyful and  _  nature. He really brightened everything up for those around him. There wasn't a postman, or a taxi driver who wasn't  _  to see Charlie. \"Cheer up, Mr. Postman, that way you'll  _  more letters today!\" he would say, or \"That was great, Mr. Taxi Driver. You  _  that thing better than anyone else. \" He also had great ideas and  _  for everything; and he shared them so generously that, just about every day in that town, someone did a great job, or  _  something new, thanks to Charlie's ideas. One day, though, he came up against a real  _  . A young boy came to town on his holidays. He was known as Waterworks and was a real crybaby. No matter what Charlie said to him, Waterworks would always find some  _  to be sad: \"I don't have many sweets... my parents didn't buy me that toy...\" Everything seemed so bad to him. But Cheerful Charlie wasn't going to be  let down  , and he kept spending more time with Waterworks,  _  trying to cheer him up, just as he did with everyone. Then, one day, when they were together in the street, someone  _  a pie from a window above by chance, and it landed  _  on Charlie's head. He got such a fright that he couldn't even move his lips. He was speechless, and although Waterworks was just about to cry, he  _  Charlie's happy words so much that he finally said, \"Wow, Charlie, that's a nice clown mask you just put on!\" On saying those words, Waterworks felt so  _  that he finally understood why Charlie was always so happy and cheerful. He realized that he was so used to Charlie's enthusiasm that he couldn't help but see the funny side of everything.",
