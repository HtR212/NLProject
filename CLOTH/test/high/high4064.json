    "article": "Sometimes people call each other \"scared-cat\", but have you ever thought about this expression? When a cat is frightened, its heart starts beating faster, its muscles get tense, and there are changes in the chemicals in its blood- stream.\n    Although the cat doesn't   _  this, its body is\ngetting ready for action.\n    If the danger continues, this animal will do one of the two things. It will   _  itself, or it will run away as fast as it can.\n  _  , when people are excited, angry, scared, or aroused by other emotions, our bodies also go through many   _  changes. Our hearts beat faster,\nand our muscles get tense. All of these changes make us more alert and ready to\nreact. We, too, get ready to defend ourselves  _  run.\nHuman beings,   _  , have a problem\nthat animals never face. If we give way to our feelings and let them  take over  , we can get into trouble. Have you ever said something in anger, or hit\nsomebody and regretted it later? Have you ever shouted at a teacher, told\nsomeone you were lonely, or said you were in love, and then  _  later you had kept your mouth shut? It isn't always  _  to express your feelings freely.\nDoes this mean that it's smarter always to   _  our\nfeelings? No! If you  _  feelings of anger,\nsadness, and bitterness hidden away or bottled up inside, your body stays  _  . Physical illnesses can develop. It can actually be  _  for your health.\nFeelings that you keep all bottled up inside, don't just   go away  . It's like you bought some bananas and stuck them in a cupboard. You might\nnot be able to see them, but  before long  you'd smell\nthem. And if you opened the cupboard, you'd  _  little\nfruit flies hovering   all over them. They'd be rotten.\n    You can try to treat emotions   as if  they were\nbananas in the cupboard. You can  _  they don't exist,\nbut they'll still be  _  . And at last you'll have to  deal with  them. Just like those bananas.",
