    "article": "I spent this morning cleaning up the home where I live. Now I am not talking about the house I am sitting in right now. As I  look around  , I can see the sink   is still full of dirty dishes. Dust is starting to   _   on the pictures, tables, and even my computer again. Dirt  _  to be swept from the floor and pet hair should be cleaned   _   the couch. What is more, the  _  in the turtle's aquarium   has to be changed.\nYet, as I look at my dirty, little house I  _  have to smile, because I know that the home in which I live is  _  right now. That home is my soul . When I   woke up   this morning I noticed that it also had become   _  again , but I wasn't willing to let it   _   for long, because I have learned that a dusty soul leads to a terrible day and terrible days lead to a (n)   _   life.\nI spent the morning clearing my soul from top to  _  . I swept the negative thoughts from my mind and the  _  feelings from my heart. Worries, anger and fear were  _  into the garbage can. When I was done, I felt   _   in my home once more.\nThe house in which I sit may need a lot of  _  but it will have to wait its turn. The home in which I live is what I am most   _   about. I hope that the same is  _  for you. I hope that you always make efforts to keep your soul  _  , beautiful, and full of love and care.\nRemember some day you will leave your house behind, but you will  _  your home with you.",
