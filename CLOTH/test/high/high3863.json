    "article": "Sharks have lived in the oceans for over 450 million years, long before dinosaurs appeared. There are now about 360  _  of sharks, whose size, behavior, and other characteristics differ widely.\nEvery year, we catch and kill over 100 million sharks,  _  for food and for their fins. Dried shark fins are used to make shark fin soup, which sells for as much as $50 a bowl in fine Hong Kong  _  . Other sharks are killed for sport and out of fear. Sharks are vulnerable  to overfishing because it  _  most species 10 to 15 years to begin reproducing and they produce only a few offspring.\n  _  by movies and popular novels, most people see sharks as people-eating monsters. This is far from the  _  . Every year, a few types of shark injure about 100 people worldwide and kill about 25. Most  _  are by great white sharks, which often feed on sea lions and other marine mammals. They sometimes mistake human swimmers for their normal prey,  _  if they are wearing black wet suits.\nIf you are a typical ocean-goer, your  _  of being killed by an unprovoked  attack by a shark are about 1 in 100 million. You are more  _  to be killed by a pig than a shark and thousands of times more likely to get killed when you drive a car.\nSharks help  _  human lives. In addition to providing people with food, they are helping us learn how to  _  cancer, bacteria, and viruses. Sharks are very healthy and have aging processes similar to ours. Their highly effective immune system  _  wounds to heal quickly without becoming infected, and their blood is being studied in connection with AIDS research.\nSharks are among the few animals in the world that almost  _  get cancer and eye cataracts. Understanding why can help us improve human  _  . Chemicals extracted from shark cartilage have killed cancerous tumors in laboratory animals.",
