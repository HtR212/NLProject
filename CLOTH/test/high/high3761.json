    "article": "Generally speaking, a British is widely regarded as a quiet, shy and conservative person who is  _  only among those with whom he is familiar. When a stranger is present, he often seems nervous,  _  embarrassed. You have to take a commuter train any morning or evening to  _  the truth of this. Serious-looking businessmen and women sit reading their newspapers or  _  off in a corner; hardly anybody talks, since to do so would be considered quite offensive .  _  , there is an unwritten but clearly understood code of behavior, which, once  _  , makes the offender immediately the object of  _  . One of the few things we can say about the British with certainty is that a British takes a(n)  _  to the discussion of their weather and that, if given a chance, he will talk about it  atlength  . Some people argue that it is because the British weather  _  follows forecast and thus becomes a source of interest to everyone. This may be so. Certainly a British cannot have much  _  in the weathermen, whose predictions, in many cases,  turn out  to be wrong! The man in the street seems to be as accurate - or as inaccurate - as the weathermen in his  _  . Foreigners may be surprised at the number of references  _  weather that the British make to each other in the course of a single day. Very often conversational greetings are  _  by comments on the weather. \"Nice day, isn't it?\" \"Beautiful day!\" may well be heard instead of \"Good morning, how are you?\"  _  the foreigner may consider this exaggerated and comic, it is worthwhile pointing out that it could be used to his  _  . If he wants to start a conversation with a British but is  ataloss  to know where to begin, he could do well to mention the state of the weather. It is a(n)  _  subject to which a response may well be  _  of even the most reserved of the British.",
