    "article": "My father died in December. He had spent the last several years in hospital, and my mother spent a lot of her time  taking care of  him. That is without doubt, a  _  situation for any family. And the  _  was a team of fairly frustrated family members. My biggest frustration was trying to  _  why he didn't make choices that would  _  him to be involved more fully in the lives of his grandchildren. Yet he  _  each and every one of them. Every morning he asked my mother which of his grandbabies was going to  _  that day. He had frequent visits from his collection of loving grandkids. Kids would have the place  _  up instantly--toys everywhere, cushions off the couches and the TV channel  _  to their station. Every visit was a kid invasion into his space. Interestingly, he was not at all bothered by the  _  or chaos at all. He was never  _  with them and he certainly never shouted at any child. Visits ended with  _  and kisses. I felt that relationship wasn't good enough because he didn't actually do anything  _  my children. My dad didn't read to the children, and certainly  _  played a board game or did a puzzle with them. He didn't take them out for  _  or do any of the other things I saw active grandparents doing with their grandchildren. It made me sad that he was  _  to get on with the kids. A couple of weeks after his death, my 9-year-old daughter turned up in my bedroom at midnight to share a  _  of him done by herself. Included in the picture were several messages and  _  --one for each day since he had died. The most striking one to me was\"I loved EVERYTHING about you, Grandpa\". Apparently, I was  _  . All that time I thought he wasn't doing anything with his grandchildren, but he was very actively doing the thing that was most  _  to them. He loved them. And it was all they needed.",
