    "article": "Just recently I had been wondering if there was much point in doing little acts of kindness. So often they get  _  , and occasionally they come back to bite you! Then, just last week, after a long travel, I found myself  _  at a bus station. The bus was four hours late! So, I guess I wasn't in a good  _  . That's when a woman asked me if I had any spare  _  to help her get a bus ticket. \"Oh, sure,\" I said sarcastically . \"How much would you like?\" As I spoke, I mentally kicked myself for my  _  and reached into my bag for some money. As I handed her five dollars, I heard low sounds from her stomach because of real  _  . I reached back into my bag and brought out a  _  I had bought earlier. I handed it to her with a(n)  _  that I hoped would make up for my earlier tone of voice. Getting a  _  look at her now, I realized she was extremely tired, like she had had several months of  _  days! As she took the food, a look of  _  washed over her. In return, she tried to give me a Milwaukee bus ticket! I don't live in Milwaukee and the ticket will probably  _  be used, but I took it. A few minutes later she came back over, apologized, and told me she was still  _  of five dollars. I took some singles out of my bag and slipped a twenty in there as well.  _  , the voice in my head told me I was being a fool. Five minutes later she came back again and tried to  _  my twenty. When I said it was for her so she could get something else to  _  , and that I was completely serious and I wasn't taking it  _  , she started crying and hugged me. From now on, when I wonder if it is  _  trying to help someone, I will remember that woman. Maybe I am really making a  _  for someone. So, sure, sometimes my efforts might not be noticed, and sometimes they might come back to bite me, but they might actually  _  another human being!",
