I step into my little cell and sit down. I glance up at the window, covered in mesh ,and think to myself, \"This isn't a life, it's just a(n)  _  .\" Being  in prison  makes me feel as though I'm being buried alive. I am a puppet with people  _  strings so that I eat, sleep and wake when they want me to. I lie on my bed as night  _  and think the same thoughts  over and over again  .

Having  _  a course as a reading adviser, I can now help others to read and write. And I have even started a creative writing workshop at Junee Correctional Centre. Learning to read and write at a highter level has given me the inner strength to present myself in a more  _  manner. And the day I've dreamed about has come true: I now enjoy my cup of coffee with a book in my other hand.
