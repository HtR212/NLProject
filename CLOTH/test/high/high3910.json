That's what you should do.\"  _  when she got to the Ohio State University, she started studying to be a vet. A scholarship allowed her to spend her  _  year studying abroad in Manchester, England. Away from the family  _  back home, she found herself one day sitting at her desk, surrounded by biology books and staring out the window, when it suddenly hit her: \"I'm in total  _  . I don't want to be a vet!\"  _  she thought back over all the things she'd done in her life and what had made her happy. And then it hit her--it was all of the youth leadership conferences that she had volunteered  _  , and the communications and leadership courses she had taken as elective courses back at Ohio State. \"How could I have been so  _  ? Here I am in my fourth year at school and just finally realizing I'm on the  _  path. I just never took the time to  _  it until now, \" she thought. Inspired by her new  _  , Julie spent the rest of her year in England taking courses in communications and media studies. When  _  to Ohio State, she was eventually able to  _  the administration to let her create her own program in \"leadership studies\",  _  it took her 2 years longer to finally graduate. She  _  to become a senior management consultant in leadership training and development for the Pentagon. She  _  founded a drug-prevention organization that  _  the message \"Lead your own life with the skill and the  _  to say no.\" So, never live someone else's  _  . If you limit your  _  only to what seems possible or reasonable, you disconnect yourself from what you truly want.",
