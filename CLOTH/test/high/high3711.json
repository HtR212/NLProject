    "article": "The Making of a Surgeon How does a doctor recognize the point in time when he is finally a \"surgeon\"? As my year as chief resident drew to a close, I asked myself this question  _  more than one occasion. The answer, I concluded, was  _  .When you can say to yourself, \"There is no surgical patient I cannot treat competently, treat just  as well as  or better than any other surgeon\"-- then, and not until then, you are  _  a surgeon.I was  _  that point.  _  , for example, the emergency situations that we met almost every night.The first few months of the year I had  _  the ringing of the telephone.I knew it meant another critical decision to be  _  .Often, after I had told Walt or Larry what to do in a particular  _  , I'd have trouble getting back to sleep.I'd  _  all the facts of the case and, often, wonder  _  I had made a poor decision.More than once at two or three in the  _  , after lying awake for an hour, I'd get out of  _  , dress and drive to the hospital to see the patient myself.It was the only  _  I could find the  _  of mind I needed to relax. Now, in the last month of my residency,  _  was no longer a problem.Sometimes I still couldn't be sure of my decision, but I had learned to  _  this as a constant problem for a surgeon.I knew that with my knowledge and experience, any decision I'd made was bound to be a  _  one.It was a nice feeling. This all sounds conceited and I guess it is --  _  a surgeon needs conceit.He needs it to encourage him in trying moments when he's bothered by the  _  and uncertainties that are part of the practice of medicine.He has to feel that he's as good as and probably better than any other surgeon in the world.Call it conceit -- call it self-confidence; whatever it was, I had it.",
