    "article": "The teacher thought hobbies were very important for every child. She  _  all her pupils to have one, and sometimes  _  for their parents to come and see the work they had done as a result. One Friday  _  the teacher told the class that those who had a hobby could have a  _  that afternoon to get the things they had made as parts of their hobbies ready for their  _  to see the following afternoon. So in the afternoon, while those of the pupils who had nothing to  _  did their usual lessons, the lucky ones who had made something  were allowed  to go home, on condition that they  returned  before five o'clock to bring what they were going to show and to arrange it. When the afternoon lesson began, the teacher was  _  to see Tommy was not there. He was the  laziest  boy in the class, and the teacher found it  _  to believe he had a hobby. However, at 4:45, Tommy arrived with a(n)  _  collection of butterflies in glass cases. After his  _  had admired them and helped him to arrange them on a table in the classroom, she was surprised to see Tommy  _  them up again and begin to leave. \"What are you doing, Tommy?\" she asked. \"Those things must  _  here until tomorrow afternoon. That's when the parents are coming to see them.\" \"I know  _  ,\" answered Tommy, \"and I will bring them back tomorrow; but my  _  doesn't want them to be out of our house at night in case they are  _  .\" \"But what has it got to do with your brother?\" asked the teacher. \"Aren't the butterflies yours?\" \"No,\" answered Tommy. \"They belong to him.\" \"But Tommy, you are  _  to show your own hobby here, not somebody else's!\" said the teacher. \"I know that,\" answered Tommy. \"My hobby is  _  my brother collecting butterflies.\"",
