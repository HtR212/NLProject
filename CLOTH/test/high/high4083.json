    "article": "I was 11 when you were born, and in your first few years I often looked after you, bathed and dressed you and took you out for walks. I have  _   memories of your childhood. Of   _  you up as a \"rock star\". Of watching you dance  _  nightclothes. Of your insistence that I make your school lunch   _  I put so much more peanut butter on your  _  than anyone else. Of the  _   phone call we ever had----an echo   of my own university years--when you wanted to  drop out of  university and study dance.\nSince we have grown up, I have lived through you, although you may not know it. You had the opportunity I so  _  wanted but never got ---- to train in the dancing arts. I encouraged our parents to support you because I have always   _   how my life would be if they hadn't chosen a(n)   _  career path for me, their eldest child.\nI know you have   _  to hunt for work and confidence, and that you probably wonder sometimes if you made the right choice.   _  , I am happy for you and proud that I played some small role in helping you to  _  a dream.\nThere is a  _  between us now. It has grown since I first left home, and in the  _   I missed your teenager years. That  _  me greatly. I imagine that you believe we have very little in common--a  dancer  in the city and a biologist in West Africa---but in you I   _   some of my own dreams realized.\nBut beyond that, even at 12 or 13 I felt as much a mother to you as an older sister. So, on the rare  _  when we see each other, I want to know everything, from your concerns, hopes to delights.\nI wish, there were an arm's   _  between us. I hope we can one day be sisters or friends again. I still make a tasty peanut butter sandwich for you.",
