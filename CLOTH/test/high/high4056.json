    "article": "I sit outside of my daughter's nursery school classroom, patiently waiting for her. When the door opens, my daughter runs out with a broad smile. She   _   the excitement of school.\n\"How was your    _   ?\"I ask casually, while    secretly  wanting to hear every single detail. \"It was so good, Mommy!\" my daughter replies. That's it. That's all I    _   .\nOn the car ride home, I ask her a lot of questions. She answers me with a few words, but never goes into much    _   . Usually she tells me that she wants to    talk about  something else.\nIt has only been a few weeks, but I still find it so    _   that my daughter has a whole morning in school without me. I    _   ask the teachers for details and I am often provided with the same    _    answers that my daughter gives.\nNow, three mornings a week, I close her classroom door behind me and she has her own    _   . I am given some    _   of her days like apples glued onto paper trees and paint dirt under her fingernails.\nI know she   _   this privacy and the time to   _   a new environment and meet different kids.   _   , I can't help but want to know about the details of her days. The ride home is the   _   time that she will provide me with some   _   about her morning.\nWhen we pull into the driveway, I change the   _   to something else. I am sure that my constant questions annoy her, so I try to   _   them to the car ride after school.\nI am   _   that my daughter doesn't quite know our driving route yet; she can't tell that I sometimes take the long way home,  _   we have those few extra minutes together.",
