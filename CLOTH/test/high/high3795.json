    "article": "Running for a Dream\nI will never forget that November day. It was hotter than normal. This was the   _   my father and I had waited so long for, because we had been working towards this race for three years. Dozens of familiar faces from church and school flashed across my view. They had come   _   me. I saw worry and   _   on my father's face. Then the race began!\nFor the first two and a half miles. I felt   _  . I had never before been so ready for something. The weeks leading up to the race were filled with controlled   _   and a strict diet. My friends hadn't seen me in weeks, but they understood the   _   required to make my dream a reality. As in all of my races,I didn't   _   out in the front,I loved the pleasure of passing people as my strength overtook their premature speed.\nThen without warning,my strength began to decrease. Neck and neck with one of my greatest competitors, I   _   see the finish line. I had begun the final dash into   _   when my knees became weak and my legs gave way. Nothing I could do would make them   _   weight.\nI watched as runners rushed by me.   _   I knew my dreams of victory were destroyed. I had to finish the race. However, my legs hurt badly. With all of the   _   left in me, I got on my hands and knees and crawled  , inch by inch, across the finish line. Voices, both   _   and familiar, cheered me on. They gave me the courage to keep   _   until the very end.\nThe doctors were there in seconds, but my eyes searched the crowd for him. There was only one person I wanted to   _   to. I whispered, \"I'm so sorry , Dad, I'm so sorry I   _   you.\" He looked at me, saying, \"You could never disappoint me. Sometimes these things just   _  . All that matters is that you did your best.\"\n\"But we worked so   _  . What about our dream?\" He reached over for my hand and said, \"Don't you know that you are my dream and it has come true?\"\nIt wasn't long before my running shoes were back on, marking a   _   path for my journey, I learned that all of the miles, the tears, the sweat, and the pain my dad and I experienced together were not for a   _  . What I realized, though, was that to him, I was the greatest prize he had ever won.",
