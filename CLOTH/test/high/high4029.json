My money was   _   and I knew I had to be creative in my shopping that day.\nFor a few seconds, Roy sat   _   on the other end of the line. The nervousness gradually increased under the wordlessness, which I couldn't wait to break through. \"Why do you ask?\" I whispered,   _   what he might say.\n\"Nancy, there's a family with six kids that will not have anything to   _   for Thanksgiving. The little one is only five years old. While you're at the store could you   _  buy something for them?\" My head began to spin when I was thinking about the fifty dollars I had   _   for our family's Thanksgiving dinner.\nIn the back of my mind I   _   the hungry guests who would be coming to our house for dinner. I put my head down on my desk, already feeling   _  . There's no way possible, I thought. But the compassion   I heard in my husband's   _   struck a nerve inside me.\nI replied, \"  _   but only if God helps.\"\nI finished my work and   _   all the way to the nearest grocery store. I entered the parking lot and noticed a big 28 _  in the grocery store window: Turkeys---29 cents a pound. \"Thank God!\" I said to myself. \nI went inside, but when I read the sign my heart   _  . \"Limit one.\" But I needed at least two so I decided to find the manager. I   _   the problem. He made an exception. To my   _  , I had enough money. I was even able to purchase a package of cookies for the five-year-old child who had   _   my heart, even though I had never met her.\nLater that afternoon, Roy and I made a special delivery to a home   _   with children of all ages. I will never forget the   _   on the six kids' faces.\nBy far, that was the greatest   _   of my life.",
