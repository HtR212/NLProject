    "article": "To a watching world, Mike and Mary Murray were a perfect couple. They had been high school sweethearts.\nAnd they   _   to have a happy marriage. Mike had a good job, and Mary was able to   stay at   home with their children. They owned their home and   _   kids, two cars, and a family dog.   _   to Mike, after seven years of marriage, something was terribly wrong. The Murrays had   reached   their material goals and Mike   _  , \"Now what?\" He began to look to his job for fulfillment and often worked 60 hour   a week  . Mary poured herself into the children. It was so   _   for her to turn her focus from Mike to 6-month-old Eric and 2-year-old Brittany.\nAnd now the marriage seemed   empty  . Their lives were traveling in two different directions. They no longer really communicated---yes, they answered   _   questions, but they didn't talk   heart to heart   as they had in the early years of their marriage. Mike felt trapped. \"I   _   had time to do things that I wanted to,\" he said. Mike did not share his feelings with Mary. Instead, he followed the slippery path of many others---he became involved with (......) a woman at work, who was   separated from   her husband. It began as a simple friendship. \"I was able to listen and she was able to listen,\" Mike recalls.\nMary   had no idea of   the battle in Mike's soul. \"He wasn't home as much, and we weren't talking as much, \" she said. \"I was wrapped up in the kids and I just couldn't imagine anything ever   happening  .\" The situation became worse when the Murrays attended a wedding and began to argue. Mary asked Mike if he was seeing   someone else   and he said, \"Yes. It's just an emotional thing.\" Mike can still remember the   _   of hurt and total surprise on Mary's face. She was troubled, and he knew that he had turned against his best friend   _   high school. The expression on her face jarred  him into   reality  , and he began to understand the   _   he was doing to his family.",
