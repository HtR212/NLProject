    "article": "My grandmother was always encouraging me to set goals and work hard to achieve them. She would tell me not to be a follower and not to set  _  on what I could achieve. She  _  \nbelieved that there were no limits that you could  _  whatever you wanted.\nI would never forget the following story that she once told me:\nA farmer won first  _  at the country fair for his huge radish  that was the exact shape and  _  of a milk bottle.\nMany were  _  as to how the farmer was able to grow this radish that was the exact shape of a milk bottle.\n  _  one gentleman went up to the farmer and asked the question. The farmer replied,\"It was  _  . I got the seed growing and then I put it into the milk bottle. It had  _  else to go.\"\nYou can use this story as an analogy   to life-our lives are  _  by the kind of surroundings we place ourselves in, the people that we allow to  _  us, and the goals we give ourselves.\nIf we only  _  and take no action, then we get no further. But if we  _  ,set a goal and take action, then our life takes a  _  shape.\nGoals and actions can help us accomplish more in a year than what some people will accomplish in a lifetime. To prove this  _  ,read the biographies of  _  people and you will see that goals and actions  in fact  played a big role in their success.\nRemember the  _  of Mary Kay Ash, who said,\"Don't limit yourself. \" Many people limit themselves to what they think they can do. You can go  as far as  your mind lets you. Whatever you believe, remember, you can achieve.\"\nIn summary, don't put yourself in a bottle; in other words, move out of what is  _  and secure if you want to move forward.",
