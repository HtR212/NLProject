I  _  in an apartment with no elevators, no dishwashers and one washer for 300  _  . The tile floors were always  _  and the rainy winter days there seemed endless. I  _  to wash my clothes by hand in the bathtub and  _  water was so costly, I trained myself to  _  my waist-length hair in less than five minutes. At that time there were no cell phones and the Internet didn't exist so far six months I had no  _  at all with my family or friends in the US. I had no relatives there so I  _  to face the fact that my  _  to adapt and create a life for  _  ,was one hundred percent up to me. At age seventeen my need for friends was  _  and not knowing a soul was, needless to say, a bit stressful. To  _  to my stress, I didn't speak the  _  and had no familiarity with the monetary system nor the transportation system. One more  _  that created stress was my  _  family. Of all the families in the city I lived, I was  _  with the ones who spoke the least (or worst) English. Living abroad and developing  _  in a foreign language required persistence and determination. I made many mistakes  _  the way. Now I've transformed my  _  memories into my medals of honor .
