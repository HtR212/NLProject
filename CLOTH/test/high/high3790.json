But as I built strength, my friends  _  me to step up my training and try some longer trips, The first one to come along was a 150-mile trip, the MS-150, an annual  _  that raises money to fight AIDS. When I registered,the idea seemed fantastic and I trained with  _  .However,as the time for the ride approached,my selfdoubts  _  beyond my endurance .I  _  wanted to raise money for the charity,but I didn't really want to bike all those miles for two days straight. The ride began on a beautiful Sunday morning in the Georgia countryside,and for the first few hours I felt  _  .This was just the experience I had  _  ,and my spirits were high.  _  by the end of the day,I felt tired out. If the body is  _  to the mind,here was evidence. Every  _  my brain pushed out seemed to travel right down to my legs. \"I can't handle this\" became a leg cramp ,and \"Everyone else is a better rider\" translated into  _  of breath. I was sure I'd have to  _  . As I topped the crest of a hill,the beautiful sunset kept me going for a few minutes more. Then in the distance,I saw a lone woman riding very slowly  _  the bright red sun. I  _  that the person looked different in some way,but I couldn't tell why. So I pushed myself to  catch up  .There she was,riding along slowly but  _  ,with a slight and determined smile on her face and she had only one leg. My focus changed in that instant. For a whole day I'd been  _  my body. But now I knew it wasn't the body,but the  _  that would help me reach my goal. It rained all the second day. I never saw the one-legged biker again,but I pushed on without  _  ,knowing she was out there with me somewhere. And at the end of the day,still feeling  _  ,I completed the 150mile trip.",
