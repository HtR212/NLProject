    "article": "Two runners stand side by side at the starting line of a race. Both look every strong and fast.  _  one runner speeds ahead and wins the race. The other falls behind. Some sportsmen can reach great goals  such as  the achievement of an Olympic gold medal while others  _  live up to their promise. What kind of  _  before a race or other event makes the  _  ? Everyone knows that sportsmen work out to strengthen their  _  . But research shows that strengthening the mind may be just as  _  . Careful study shows that the best sportsmen win  _  because they think they can win. Thinking positive thoughts seems to give possibility for  _  in sports. People who say to themselves over and over, \"I know I can do this,\" often find they have the  _  to win. On the other hand, people who think \"I can't win\" often  _  . One procedure that helps many sportsmen is creating  _  in the mind. They are told to think of each  _  they must make to win. Some use pictures that are more fanciful. One skater liked to  _  a star bursting inside her,  _  her with energy. Another sportsman who wanted to feel  _  pictured himself as a  _  floating in the air. Next time you want to do something well, try training your  _  to help you. Perhaps a teacher or other instructor can help you plan your training. If you imagine yourself doing better, you may soon see  _  in what you  _  can do. Positive thinking and picture created in your mind can help you win!",
