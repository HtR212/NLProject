    "article": "Last summer I went through a training program and became a volunteer teaching people how to read. When I  _  what other people's lives were like because they could not read, I began to realize the true  _  of reading.\nMy first student Marie was a 44-year- old single mother of three children. In the first lesson, I found out she walked two miles to the nearest  _  twice a week because she didn't know which bus to take. When I told her I would get her a bus schedule. She told me it would not help because she could not read it. She said she also had  _  once she got to the supermarket because she couldn't always  _  the things that she really needed.  _  she did not know words, she could not write out a shopping list. Also, she could only  _  items by sight.\nWe worked hard together, learning how to build Marie's  _  , which encouraged her to  _  in her studies. She began to make rapid  _  and was even able to take the bus to the supermarket. After this  _  trip, she told me how self-confident she felt.  _  the end of the program, she began  _  her youngest son with his reading. She sat with him before he went to  _  and read bedtime stories. When his eyes became  _  with excitement as she read,  _  was written all over her face. As she described this experience, I was proud of myself as  _  . I found that helping Marie to build  _  self-confidence was very rewarding.\nI learned a great deal about  _  and helping others and I may have learned more from the  _  than Marie did.",
