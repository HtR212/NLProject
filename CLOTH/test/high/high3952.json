Milne\nI have spent most of my career as a traveling salesman. There's  _  lonelier than having meals myself in a coffee shop. One year, my five-year-old daughter Jeanine gave me a  _  . It was a soft toy penguin with a hand -painted  _  saying \"I love My Dad!\"  Tears came into my eyes and immediately, I gave it a  _  place on my desk.\nSoon I had to leave on another business  _  . This time when I was  _  , I put the penguin in my suitcase. After that day, Jeanine always helped me pack with the penguin. Many years  _  by and that little penguin has traveled with me hundreds of thousands of miles all across America and over to Europe. We have also made many friends  _  the way.\n  _  one afternoon after leaving my hotel, I discovered that the penguin was  _  . Frantically, I phoned the hotel. The clerk  _  , saying it hadn't been reported. But half an hour later, he called back to say that my penguin had been found. It was late,  _  I drove several hours to get my little  _  , arriving near midnight.\nWhen I rushed to the hotel, I found that it was waiting at the front desk. In the lobby , some  _  business travelers looked at us, I think, with some  _  and envy . Someone came out to shake my hand. One man told me that he had even volunteered to  _  it to me the very next day.\nJeannie is in college now and I don't travel  _  much anymore. The penguin spends most of its time  _  on my dresser--- a reminder that  _  is the best traveling companion. All those years on the road, it was the one thing I never left home  _  .",
