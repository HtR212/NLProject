He has the body, skills and the basketball brain of an All-Star. \nThis   _   was   _   as he scored 41 points to take Cleveland Cavaliers to a 107-104 win over the New Jersey Nets on March 28. Aged of 19 years and 87 days, James became the   _   player to score 40 or more in the NBA. \n\"It was by far James' best   _  ,\" said Cleveland coach Paul Silas. \nKnown to his friends   _   \"the king\", this was the day James earned his crown. But he was   _   from being a king during his childhood spent in the back streets of Akron, Ohio.    _   many other African-American basketball players, James' early years were a   _  . His mother Gloria was just 16 when she gave birth to him; he knows nothing about his father. Mother and son battled for everything from food to a place to live in.   _   the help from his grandmother and neighbors, James would   _   have died when he was young. \nThis spirit of survival has served him well on court, forcing him to take any   _   he finds. \"I   _   losing, I don't like losing,\" said James after his 41-point display. \"I   _   the opportunity for us to win and I was   _   to capture it.\" At 2.03 meters, he is shorter than Yao Ming but this didn't   _   him being first choice in 2003 NBA draft. This was   _   to his strength and skill, much of which he learned from high school American football. \nAlthough he has a   _   brain, James has never had to concentrate on   _  . Some people think this is a mistake and say he should have gone to college to   _   his mind. But James is one of the lucky few who have found fame and fortune   _   a diploma. On the court, he is king.",
