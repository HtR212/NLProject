    "article": "Growing trees in the concrete jungle of Los Angels brings neighbors benefits beyond beauty. As the  _  of TreePeople, a nonprofit organization he founded in 1973, Andy, now 54, has inspired hundreds of thousands of volunteers to  _  plant more than two million trees throughout Southern California. Tree People  _  tools, blueprints, planting demonstrations, and tree-care supervisors free to all the participants,  _  me. \"You will need their support,\" Andy said, referring to my neighbors. \"  _  the community behind you, the trees you plant will die in five years.\" So I started knocking on doors, hoping to share  _  I'd learnt in Tree People's seminar about the critical role of trees in removing smog from the  _  , cooling our homes and preventing water runoff. Strange  _  it may seem, some people are afraid of trees. \"The roots destroy sidewalks,\" one neighbor said, \"  _  will ruin my pipes. And I don't want leaves.\"  Another  told me. When I called Andy about the  _  I was getting from my neighbors, he encouraged me to keep trying. So my son and my wife delivered cookies while I went door to door. It  _  us half a year to sign permission forms from 16 neighbors for 21 trees. When the big day arrived, I was excited and  _  . What if I threw a planting tree and  _  else came? But as I set out shovels , my son and wife made cakes and doughnuts,  _  started to gather. Friends brought friends. Neighbors came with cousins and grandchildren. A local middle school even  showed up  with half the seventh grade. More than 300 people joined us. Then Andy led us in a  _  : welcoming each tree into the world and  _  it name. After the ceremony, as I shook hands with volunteers and my neighbors, I  _  help but feel we'd accomplished  _  great. After all, trees need people, and people need trees.",
