The villagers went to the  _  and said,\"My goodness, what great misfortune! Your son has broken his leg; now he can't  _  you in the fields.\"One day later, government troop went to the village  looking for  young men to join the  _  . They had to leave the boy  _  because his leg was broken. Again, the villagers came and said,\"My goodness, what great  _  !\" The farmer replied, \"It is neither fortune  _  misfortune.\" Then one day the farmer's  _  horse jumped the fence and ran away. The villagers came and said,\"What great misfortune that your horse has run away.\" Two or three days later, the horse  _  with a dozen wild horses  _  it. The villagers came and said,\"What great misfortune that your horse came back with twelve  _  .\" The farmer was  _  enough to know that nothing was either fortune or misfortune. Everything that happens has a  _  and meaning beyond  _  appearances of the events. So many times, we are  _  by the feelings we have about the events in our lives. Remember: \"Nothing is long or short, hot or cold, good or bad.\" There is no  _  in thinking of something as good or bad, because we  _  know what will happen next. The best thing we can do is  _  it.",
