She had this circular way of  _  you took responsibility for your decisions and the person you would  _  . She would say,\" It' s your  _  .\"  _  \"What you want and what you get are sometimes two  _  different things.\" And then, \"No one ever said life was fair.\" And she would  _  these comments together in such a way that you could never  _  an argument, and yet, the  _  was that you realized your life is going to be what you make it. So I might go to my mom and say, \"I'd like to  _  football\". And she would say, \"Well, it's your life. If you want to go out there and get  beaten up  and hurt and break your knees and limp around the rest of your life, that' s fine.\" That is  _  I would say, \"Well, you know, that won't  _  . I' m really fast.\" And she would reply, \"Well, we don't really have the money.\" And then I would  _  , \"Yes but that' s not fair.\" And she would reply, \" Well, life isn't  _  .\" Then I would say, \"But I've been itching to.\" And she would reply, \"Yes, but what you want and what you get are usually two entirely different things.\" It was the combination of these  _  that allowed my mother to lead me down the right path under her  _  but let me feel as if I was making the decisions  _  my own. The sum total of that  _  was, in the end, you're  _  for the life you lead. That' s the best advice I've ever gotten.",
