    "article": "My friends and I recently returned from our annual week at the beach.  While we were there, a couple of us needed to  pickup  a few goods at the grocery store.\n  As we were   _  out,\nthe cashier praised me for my necklace.I thanked her, and she asked   _  .I bought it.I had gotten it at the department store just down the street, and told her that it was on sale for 40%   _  .My friend suggested that she should walk over and purchase one during her    _  .But the cashier said she couldn't   _  it\nright now.\n  As we left the grocery store, I told my friend I   _  to buy one for her. She agreed, and offered to   _  for\nhalf. So we went back to the department store and picked out a   _  necklace for the\ncashier. As we paid for it, the sales lady noticed that I was   _  the same one.\n\"You   _  really\nlike this necklace,\" she commented.\n We told her   _  we were buying it for. To our surprise, the sales lady knew her!\n\"She is a very sweet lady,\" she remarked, \"But she is going througha  _  patch right now\nand has to drive a long way to work. With gas   _  so high it\nsure isn't easy.\"\n With   _  ,we took the gift back to the grocery store and stood in  _  at the same cash register. When our time came we just handed her the gift.   She knew   _  what we had done\nand was so  _  .\n It feels so good to do nice things for   _  .I grew up poor, with a  _  mother and two\nsisters and I never dreamed as a little girl that I would be able to help\nothers.",
