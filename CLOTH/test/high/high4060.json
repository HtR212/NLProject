When a woman in a passing car  looked up  and made eye contact, naturally, I  _  . It was the beginning of a year of window antics . When things were  _  , I stood in the window and waved at the passengers who looked up. And this made me laugh- work  _  was washed away. It didn't  _  long to attract the following - a man with a construction truck, the carpool crowd and the business lady with her children.... When waving became  _  , I made signs: \"Hi!\", \"Hello!\", \"Be Happy!\" I  _  them in the window and waved. Christmas approached. Job cuts were announced. Several co-workers would  _  their jobs.

He looked up, saw me, paused,  _  his head, turned and left. I  _  trouble. The phone on the desk rang.

When he regained  _  , he said, \"Thanks, Mike! With the job cuts, it's been hard to enjoy the  _  season. Thanks for the laugh, I needed it.\" That evening, and every evening of the Christmas season, I stood  _  in the window and waved to my  _  . The bus crowd waved wildly, and the little children smiled at the strange Santa. My heart filled with joy. For a few minutes each day, we could forget the loss of jobs.",
