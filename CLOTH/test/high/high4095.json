She wasn't even four, but she  _  at my coat and said, \"That man's cold. Daddy, can we take him home?\" I don't remember my  _  . But I do remember a sudden  _  feeling inside me. I had always been delighted at how much my daughter noticed in her  _  , whether it was birds flying or children playing. But now she was noticing  _  and beggary. A few days later, I saw an article in the newspaper about volunteers who picked up a food package from a nearby school on a Sunday morning and  _  it to an elderly person. I signed us up. Nora was  _  about it. She could understand the importance of food, so she could easily see how  _  our job was. When Sunday came, she was ready, but I had to  _  myself to leave the house to fetch the food package. On my way to the school, I fought a(n)  _  to turn back. The Sunday paper and coffee were waiting for me at home. Why do this?  _  , we phoned the elderly person we'd been appointed. She  _  us right over. The building was in a bad state. A silver-haired woman in an old dress received us. Nora ran inside. I  _  followed. However, when we talked, I was moved by her struggle against the hard life and realized what our little help meant to her. When the time came to say goodbye, we three hugged. I walked home  in tears  , touched. Professionals call such a  _  \"a volunteer opportunity\". They are opportunities and I've come to see.  _  else but as volunteers do you have the opportunity to do something  _  that's good for others as well as for yourself? Nora and I regularly serve meals to needy people and  _  clothes for the homeless. Yet, as I've  _  her grow over these past four years, I still wonder - which of us has benefited more?",
