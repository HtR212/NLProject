Every now and then, as most philosophy professors do, he would go off on one of those hard-to-understand \"what's the meaning of 43 _ \" discussions. Many of those discussions went   _  , but there were a few that really hit home . This was one of them.\n\"  _   to the following questions by a    _   of hands,\" my professor instructed.\n\"How many of you can tell me something about your parents?\" Everyone's hand   went up  .\n\"How many of you can tell me something about your grandparents?\" About three-fourths put up their hands.\n\"How many of you can tell me something about your great-grandparents?\" Two out of sixty students  _   their hands.\n\"Look around the room,\" he said, \"In just two short generations   _   any of us even know   _  our own great-grandparents were. Oh sure, maybe we have an old photograph in a musty(cigar box.   _   maybe we know the classic family   _   about how one of them walked five miles to school barefoot. But how many of us    _   know who they were, what they thought, what they took pride in, what they were afraid of, or what they dreamed about? Think about that. Within three generations our ancestors are all but forgotten. Will this    _   to you?\"\n\"Here's a better question. Look    _   three generations. You are long    _  . Instead of you sitting in this room, now it's your great-grandchildren. What will they have to say    _   you? Will they know about you? Or will you be    _  , too?\"\n\"Is your life going to be a     _   or an example? What legacy will you leave? The    _   is yours. Class dismissed.\"\nNobody rose from their seats for five minutes.",
