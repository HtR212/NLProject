    "article": "The Manager Who Couldn't Write \nWhat launched Amy Tan's career was not a big break, but a good reason. \nBefore the million-copy  _  of\nThe Joy Luck Club, The Kitchen God's Wife and The Hundred Secret Senses, Amy\nTan was a writer--a business writer. She and a partner  _  a\ntechnical-writing business with lawyer-like \"billable hours\".\nHer  _  with customers\nwas largely that of account management--  _  this daughter of\nimmigrants wanted to do something more  _  with\nwords, English words.\nSo she decided to talk to her   _  , \"I want to do more writing.\" He  _  her strength\nwas doing estimates, going after contractors and collecting bills. \"It was  _  stuff.\" The very stuff\nTan hated and knew she wasn't  _  good at. But\nher partner  _  that writing was her weakest\nskill.\n\"I thought. I can   _  him\nand just keep doing this or make my demands.\" So she  _  and\nstood up for her rights.\nHe would not give in. Shocked, Tan said, \"I   _  .\"\nAnd he said: \"You can't quit. You're   _  !\" And added, \"You'll never make a dime(ten cents)writing.\" \nTan set out to   _  him\nwrong, taking on as many assignments as she  _  . Sometimes\nshe worked 90 hours a week. Of course, being on her own was rather  _  . But not letting others limit her or define her  _  made\nit worthwhile. And on her own, she felt  _  to try fiction. And so The Joy Luck Club, featuring the bright,\nlonely daughter of Chinese immigrants, was born. And the manager who couldn't\nwrite became one of America's bestselling, best-loved  _  .",
