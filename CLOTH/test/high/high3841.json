    "article": "There is one word that is on the lips of Americans, day and night, \"Sorry\".\nOnce as I was walking on the street, a young man ran by   _  , brushing against my handbag.   Even as   he continued on his way, he   _   back and said \"sorry\" to me. Even in a rush, he didn't forget to apologize.\nOne day, after I bought some apples, the salesman was giving me the change,   _   I wasn't ready for it, and   a coin   dropped on the ground, \"I'm sorry,\" he said while bending down to pick it up. I was   _  --why would he apologize when it was my   _  ?\nAnother time, I   _   on a man's foot in an escalator  . At the same time , we both said \"sorry\". I thought it   _   at first: was it really   _   for him apologize?\nLater on, an American friend   _   to me that according to the American   _  , the escalator is a(n)   _   place which everyone should be able to stand in. After someone occupies a position in the escalator, making it   _   for someone else to find a place to stand in, isn't it necessary to   _   an apology?\nDuring my stay in America, I gradually   _   that when friction   occurs in daily life, Americans don't care much about who is   _  . If someone is   _  , a \"sorry\" is always necessary. Even if the other person is hurt, the \"sorry\" would   _   tempers . Perhaps this is   _   I never saw anyone quarreling on the buses, subways or streets in America.",
