I became an extremely  _  young lady. One day  _  in the 6th grade class was told by Mr. Hadley that we would be  _  to stand up in front of the class and read the  _  that we had completed. When my turn came, I  _  to stand up in front of all those students and  open up  to their tricks. Mr. Hadley came over to me and again  _  me to read my report. I gave it back to him. He walked to the front of the  _  and said, \"Yvonne has a very good report here and I think everyone  _  to hear her read it. If I hear anyone making  _  noises or making fun of her in any way, I will let you fail right here and now. Understood?\" Mr. Hadley walked back to me and  _  me the paper, asking me to go to the front of the class. I walked to the front of the class on legs  _  were shaking and I felt a(n)  _  in my chest. Everyone were all quiet, including those boys. I stood there trying to gain  _  . Mr. Hadley walked over to me putting his arm around me, \"You can do it. I have  _  in you!\" His words helped calm me. I  _  the report and instead of the kids laughing at me and  making fun of  me, they all stood up and clapped their hands. From that day on the kids never made fun of me again and some  _  made friends with me. I continued to be quite shy all through school  _  from that day on I knew if I had to stand up in front of class again. I could do it.",
