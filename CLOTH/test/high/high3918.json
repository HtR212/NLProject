    "article": "One day, when I was in high school, I saw a kid named Kyle walking home from school with all his books, I thought to myself, \"  _  would anyone bring home all his books for the weekend? He must really be  _  .\" As I was walking, I saw several kids running toward him. They ran at him,  _  all his books out of his arms and he fell down in the dirt. His glasses went  _  and landed in the grass. My heart went out to him. So, I ran over to him.  _  I handed him his glasses, he looked at me and said, \"Hey, thanks!\" I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As it  turned out  , he lived near me. We talked all the way home. Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. Kyle was the  _  student of our class, one of those guys that really found themselves during high school. Therefore he had the  _  to prepare a graduation speech. On the graduation day, I could see that he was  _  . So, I patted him on the back and said, \"Hey, big guy, you'll be great!\" He looked at me and smiled. He cleared his throat, and began. \"Graduation is a time to  _  those who helped you make it through those  _  years. Your parents, your teachers... but mostly your friends, I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best  _  you can give him.\" I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met. He had planned to  _  himself over the weekend and was carrying his books home. \"Thankfully, nothing happened. My friend  _  me from doing the unspeakable.\" Not until that moment did I realize that you should never underestimate the  _  of your actions. With one small gesture you can change a person's life. For better or for worse.",
