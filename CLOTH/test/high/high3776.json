She was just a good friend, but because she  came over  to my apartment, brought me medicine, and made me breakfast, I thought for the first time \"what a super wife she will  _  for someone.\"\nI took her out to eat for helping me  get over  the flu. After that we became even better friends, but still  _  thought of marriage. A few months later I was going to  _  a new job in the Atlanta area, so Cathy helped me  pack up  boxes to get ready to leave. We  _  a great time that day and had lunch together. Near the end of that day I  _  a few tears in Cathy's eyes, so I asked what was  _  .\nShe said, \"I don't know if I can live  _  you, you are my best friend.\" I said, \"I know, I've been thinking the  _  thing.\" That day we decided to get married and we have been married ever since. We have had our  _  times, as many others have had, but we are still best friends!\n  _  I get to the family unit in my Health class and we talk about  _  ...I always tell this story. My students seem to love it because they learn that  _  , sharing and caring about others is all that really  _  in life, and that looks, money and other things are not important.\n  _  the way, my wife is 12 years younger than me, and she is beautiful. We have 2 beautiful children, but we still have dates on  _  weekend.\nCathy is the greatest thing that has ever  happened to  me! She is a fantastic mother, and the best wife a coach could ever have. Thank God I got sick 27 years ago!",
