Do your homework or you won't learn a thing.\" And it's true, sometimes he did feel like a ding-a-ling .  But what could he do? He     _  homework.\n  Then on St. Patrick's Day his cat was   _  with a little\ndoll and he grabbed it away. To his  _  it wasn't a doll at all, but a man of the tiniest  size with a high tall hat. He shouted, \"Save me! Don't give me back to that cat. I will make any of your wishes come true. I     _  you that.\" Patrick\ncouldn't  _  how lucky he was! Here was the\nanswer to all of his problems. So he said, \"  Only if  you do\nall my homework until the end of the semester. If you do a good enough job, I\ncould even get A's.\"   \n  And   _  to\nhis word, that little elf  began to do Patrick's homework. The elf didn't   _  know what to do and he needed help.\"Help me! Help me!\" he'd say. And Patrick would   _  to help--in whatever way. \"I don't   _  this word,\" the elf squeaked while reading Patrick's homework. \"Get me a dictionary. No, what's even   _  .\nLook up the word and sound it out by each letter.\" When it  _  to math, Patrick was out of luck. \"What are tables?\" the elf\nsqueaked. \"We elves never need that. Here, sit down beside me. You simply must  _  me.\" The little elf, already a shouter, just got  louder  , \"Go to the library, I need books. More and more books. And you can help\nme read  _  too.\"\n  In fact, every day and in every way that little elf was a nag ! Patrick was working harder than ever and was   staying up  at night. He had\nnever felt so  _  that he was going to school\nwith his  _  puffed  and red. Finally the last day of school arrived and Patrick got his A's which   _  his classmates, teachers and parents.",
