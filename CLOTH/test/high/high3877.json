The affordable  _  are designed to be used by the poor as well as survivors of war and natural disasters. \"By the time 2020, there's going to be about 1.7 billion people living in slums so we would like to  _  change,\" says Stephanie Hunt, co-founder of the Hunt Institute for Engineering and Humanities at SMU. The institute, which  _  build the village on SMU's campus, was established to solve problem of the poor in the United States and around the world through engineering, and the free  _  . The goal is not just to  _  lives, but to change the victims' lives. The Institute hopes some entrepreneurs might program and  _  some money with these ideas. One of the structures in the SMU village was built with bricks made  _  from recycled plastic bags. They're  _  together with heavy wires. Harvey Lacey, father of two college-aged sons, including one here at SUM, heard about this project and  _  his invention. It's a heavy-duty, hand-crank compactor that anybody can use to form the big bricks he calls Ubuntu Blox. \"The advantages are that these  _  weigh less than two pounds. They're very, very  _  These things can go for many generations of housing, \"says Lacey, who is  giving away  the design. Anybody can follow his online plans to  _  the compactor that turns plastic bags into bricks. On this warm day, it's  _  inside the Ubuntu Blox hut, thanks  _  to the thick plastic insulation . Kenyan  _  Ronald Omyonga, visiting the global village before returning to his native Africa, says his country is full of these recyclable bags. With Lacey's design, he says that litter could be transformed into  _  housing. He dreams of other  _  too. \"Look at the Harvey Lacey hut, as a means of creating  _  ,\"says Omyonga.\"Leaning the environment, and turning  _  into something that can form houses, not just for the poor.\"",
