    "article": "Some time ago I discovered that one of my chairs had a broken leg. I didn't think there would be any difficulty in getting it   _  , as there are a whole lot of antique  shops near my home.   _  I left home one morning carrying the chair with me. I went into the first   _  expecting a friendly reception. I was quite   _  . The man wouldn't even look at my chair.\nThe second shop, though slightly more   _  , was just the same, and the third and the fourth, so I decided that my  _  must be wrong.\nI entered the fifth shop with a(n)  _  in my mind. I placed the chair on the floor and said to the shopkeeper, \"Would you like to  _  a chair?\"\nHe looked it over   _  and said, \"Yes, not a bad chair. How much do you want for it, sir?\"  \"20 pounds,\" I said.\n\"OK,\" he said, \"I'll give you 20 pounds.\"\n\"It's got a slightly broken leg,\" I said.\n\"Yes, I saw that, it's   _  .\"\nEverything was going according to plan and I was getting   _  . \"What will you do with it?\" I asked.\n\"Oh, it will be easy to sell   _  the repair is done.\"\n\"I'll buy it,\" I said.\n\"What do you mean? You've just   _  it to me,\" he said.\n\"Yes, I know but I've   _  my mind. I am sorry. I'll give you 27 pounds for it.\"\n\"You must be   _  ,\" he said. Then,   _  the penny dropped. \"I know what you want. You want me to repair your chair.\"\n\"You're   _  ,\" I said. \"And what would you have done if I had walked in and said, 'Would you mend this chair for me?'\n\"I wouldn't have   _  to do it,\" he said. \"We don't do repairs, not enough money in it and too much   _  . But I'll mend this for you, shall we say for five pounds?\"\nHe was a very nice man and was greatly   _  by the whole thing.",
