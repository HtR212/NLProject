    "article": "People from Great Britain brought the English language to North America in the 16th and 17th centuries. And in the  _  300 years, there have been so many  _  in both places that now people can easily  _  an English person from an American in the  _  he or she talks.\nMany old words  _  in England but were kept in America. For example, 300 years ago people in Great Britain got their water from something they  _  either a \"aucet\", \"spigot\", or a \"tap\". All these words are  _  heard in different parts of America, but only \"tap\" is still  _  in England. Americans often make  _  new words or change old ones. \"Corn\" is one kind of plant in America and  another  in England.\nAlso, over the last three centuries the English language has  _  thousands of new words for things that weren't  _  before. And often, American and English people used two  _  names for them. A tin can is called \"tin\" for short in English, but a \"can\" in America. The word \"radio\" is  _  all over the world, including America. But many English people call it a \"wireless\". And almost anything  _  something to do with cars, railroads, etc. has different  _  in British and American English.\nBut now American and British English may be  _  closer together. One thing is that  _  people can hear a large amount of American speech daily in  _  , on television, or from travelers. Because of this, Americans  _  to be influencing the British more and more. So some day, English may even be the same on both sides of the Atlantic.",
