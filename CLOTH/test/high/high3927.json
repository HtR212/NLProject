    "article": "In general, I don't cry very often. But in early August 2011, I did a lot of crying. All these  _  were for one simple reason: I really, really didn't want to leave China. But, I already had my plane ticket, and my work visa was  _  , so I had no  _  but to go back to America. For a while, I was  _  to be reunited with my family, my friends, and most importantly, my dog. I also enjoyed catching up on all the films, TV shows, and music I'd  _  .Soon after I arrived home, I began  _  with my family and my friends. I told them how I loved my  _  in China, and how I hoped to come back one day. They said, \"Maybe you can go again next year.\" And now here I am,  _  one whole year teaching oral English at Harbin No. 1 High School. My  _  teaching experience gave me much  _  that I am now putting to use. I now feel  _  about my teaching abilities that I even have a teaching philosophy. My philosophy is one simple word: interact. I try to make the students  _  for much more of the class period. I also like to play games in class ,as well as doing art projects, acting, and  _  having discussions. To teach English as a foreign language in a non-English-speaking country can be quite  _  at times. I feel it is probably more difficult for students to relate to the material if they are not often  _  by English. Making things even more difficult is the  _  that the English they do come across is often  _  , or, while grammatically correct, is not at all native-sounding. This kind of English, I think, can actually be  _  to students' learning.  _  ,maybe \"Chinglish,\" both written and spoken, is just one of the  _  to building a country full of English speakers.",
