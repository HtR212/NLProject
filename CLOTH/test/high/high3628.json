Actually, my younger   _   often reminds me of why I must keep trying to slow down. In fact, the other day, she reminded me once again.\nThe two of us had taken a bike ride to the 45 _ . After buying a cool ice cream for her, my daughter sat down at a table46 _  looking at the ice cream she held in her hand. Suddenly a look of worry    appeared on   her face. \"Do I have to rush, Mama?\"\nI nearly    _  . Perhaps the pains of a 49 _  life don't ever completely disappear, I thought sadly. As my child looked up at me waiting to know    _   she could take her time, I knew I had a choice . I could sit there  in  _  thinking about the number of times when I told my child to   _  through life..., or I could just try to do things   _   . I chose the latter \n\"You don't have to rush. Just take your time,\" I said  _  . Then we   _   side by side talking merrily. There were even moments when we sat in   _   , only smiling at each other .\nWhen she got to the last bite , she held out the ice cream for me. \"I    _   the last bite for you, Mama,\" my daughter said    _   . I realized I just got the deal of a lifetime. I gave my child a little time...and    in return   , she gave me her last bite and reminded me that things taste sweeter and love comes    _   when you stop rushing through life.",
