Worse still, I was not good at  _  constructively.\nOnce as I was getting ready for school, my mother  _  me my father's vest instead of mine. This was around the time when I was going to be larger in  _  than my father, so as I put on the vest, I felt like I was being choked in it! I  _  that it was a small oversight  on my mother's part, but  _  the feeling of being choked drowned me and I got very angry.\nI took my anger out on my mother  _  thinking much. I was so upset when she had handed me the wrong vest, and I  _  by violently tearing it apart from my chest!\nLater, my mother shared her own  _  with my father: \" See what your son has done.\"\nInstead of scolding or abusing me, my father  _  responded by asking my mother to  save up  the vest. He then worn it to work the next day.\nWhen my mother told me about my father's response much later, when I had  _  from my fit, I immediately felt a great sense of  _  for my violent behavior, just  _  that he was spending the entire day wearing a(n)  _  vest. At the same time, I was filled with great  _  for my father, whose gentle kindness taught me a life lesson I would treasure forever.\nOn that day, I made a  _  never to let anger get the better of me. I learn to  _  other when I think that they behave in an unfair, cruel, or unacceptable way,   _   forgiveness is a tool to turn anger off. And whenever I have difficulty  _  my strong emotion, I try to remember my father's vest.",
