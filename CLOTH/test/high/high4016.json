An enormous amount of energy and resources went into the construction of those houses.And it would take an average of 65 years for the  _  carbon emissions from a(an)  _  energy-efficient home to make up for the  _  lost by destroying an old one. So in the broadest sense, the greenest home is the one that has already been built.But at the same time,  _  half of US carbon emissions come from heating, cooling and powering our  _  , offices and other buildings.\"You can't deal with climate  _  without dealing with existing buildings,\" says Richard Moe, the president of the National Trust. With some exceptions, the oldest homes tend to be the  _  energy-efficient.Houses built before 1939 use about 50% more energy per square foot than those built after 2000, mainly due to the tiny cracks and gaps that  _  over time and let in more outside  _  .  _  ,there are a vast number of relatively simple changes that can green older homes, from  _  ones like Lincoln's Cottage to your own postwar home.And efficiency upgrades can save more than just the earth; they can help  _  property owners from rising power  _  .",
