    "article": "A boy was walking home from school when he saw a large apple on one of the  branches of an apple tree hanging out over a tall fence. In fact, the boy disliked  _  , preferring a bar of chocolate if given the choice. However, as they say, the forbidden fruit can be  _  .  Seeing the apple, the boy wanted it. The more he looked at it, the  _  he felt and the more he wanted that apple.\nHe stood on tiptoe,  _  as high as he could, but even as his tallest  _  he was unable to touch it. He began to  _  .up and down, as high as he could, at the  _  of each jump stretching his arms to get the apple.  Still it remained out of  _  .\nNot giving up, he thought, if only he had something to  _  0n.  His school bag  wouldn't give enough height and he didn't want to  _  he things inside, like his lunch  box, pencil case, and books. Looking  _  ,he hoped he might find an old box, a rock, or, with luck, even a ladder,  _  it was a tidy neighborhood and there was nothing he  could use.\nHe had tried everything he could think to do.  _  seeing any other choices, he  gave up  and started to walk away. At first he felt angry and disappointed thinking about  how hungry he had become from his  _  ,and how he really wanted that apple. The  more he  _  like this, the more unhappy he became.\nHowever, the boy of our story was a pretty smart guy, even if he couldn't always get  _  he wanted. He started to say  _  himself, \"This isn't helpful. I don't have the apple and I'm feeling unhappy as well.  There's  _  more I can do to get the apple-that is unchangeable-but we are supposed to be able to  _  0ur feelings. If that's the case what can I do to feel better?\"",
