    "article": "About one year ago, a couple with three children moved into the apartment next door to me. I never heard any noise from the children. Instead, I often heard the parents yelling  _  at the kids, not in a nice tone, but in a  _  one. We often  _  in the hallway. I always greeted them, but the only  _  I ever got was a \"hello\" from the eightyearold girl. I usually  went out  to see my doctor and one day when I returned they were just  _  their apartment and the little girl was  _  the outside door open for the others. I  _  in the car doing  _  things because I wasn't eager to be snubbed again. Finally, I got out of my car and walked towards the door. The parents were telling their daughter to hurry and get into the car,  _  the little girl was still holding the door,  waiting for  me! I hurried although I was still in pain from my injury. I forgot to tell her how  _  I was for her kindness. I wrote a note saying how much her act of kindness had  _  an old man's heart. The next day there was a  _  on my door and it was the little girl and her father. She was quite  _  of her behavior and thanked me. Then I noticed her mother standing there too. Her parents  _  me. From then on when we met in the hallway we always greeted each other,in a friendly  _  . Last night there was a heavy snow. I looked out at my car and  _  how I was going to keep my doctor's  _  because I could only walk for a short time. This morning when I opened the front door, all the snow was removed. Isn't it  _  that the small kind act of an 8yearold girl can change so many things for the better? It is said that good things come from small acts.",
