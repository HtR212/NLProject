Now with my last   _   in middle school, I thought, why not try to   _   something while I still had the opportunity. When I told my husband Bob my idea, a broad smile lit up his face. \"If that's what you   _  , we'll make it work.\" \nWhen we asked the kids for advice, they had mixed   _  . Our daughter, already in college, thought it a great idea while John, in high school, was   _   that we might be in college at the same time. James, our youngest, wanted to know who would take him to football practice. I   _   that things would be a little different,   _   if everyone contributed, it wouldn't be difficult. \nThe next day we drove to the community college and after a careful research, I chose to   _   in occupational therapy   .\nDays passed in excitement, enrolling(register) in classes, shopping for   _   and attending orientation . I felt like a kid again, but as the first day of classes drew near, I became   _  . I was simply too old. People would laugh at me. Finally, with encouragement from my family and friends, I stuck with my   _  .\nAs I entered my classroom that first morning, I chose a seat in the back, hoping to   _   attention. For the rest of that day, I did what I saw the other students do, and gradually, my self-consciousness(embarrassment deriving from the feeling that others are critically aware of you) faded. I found the classes and assignments   _  , and I left that day feeling I might survive. By the end of the first week, I had made a few friends.\nStudying and keeping up with my duties at home was   _  . No sooner would I begin to study than it was time to drive the kids to their activities. Math and science were   _   my strong subjects, so I devoted more time to those. When the first semester   _  , I had a 4.0 GPA and was placed on the Honor Roll. \nBy the second year, Bob and the kids were all doing their   _  , and I had learned how to comfortably   _   my school and home life. My hard work paid off. I was awarded a scholarship and got the bachelor's degree.\nAs I drove away on the last day of school, I thought about what a difference returning to   _   had made in my life. I looked much younger and I had more   _  and enthusiasm for life. I even became a therapist. It's never too late to try again.",
