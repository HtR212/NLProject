So after work I always walk to his office and wait for him to drive mc home.\nOne day, while I was waiting for him, a beautiful Cadillac  pulled up  near me.Honestly, the driver was probably the prettiest woman I had ever seen outside of a movie screen. Her eyes were as blue as the sea, and she had  _  like an even row of pearls. Minutes later, a man came out of the building and walked over to her. They kissed and drove off.\nSitting there, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, I wanted to cry. It is so  _  that some people have it all.\nThe next week I saw her again, and after that it became almost  _  o see her. I would wonder if she and her husband ate out a lot and where they went.  I wanted her to  get out of  the car so I could see her in full length. Did she wear classy, high-heeled shoes?\nA few weeks, I was waiting in my usual spot and the lady's husband came over to their car.He opened the door. Slowly the pretty woman walked around to the passenger side--  _  on a walking cane. She  _  one leg with her hands and then the other one; she had a prosthetic  on her left leg and a brace   on her right one.\nWhen my husband arrived I told him about what had happened. He said he knew her husband and that, when the lady was 12 years old, she had been  _  in a car that got stuck on the railroad tracks. Both her parents were killed.The rail company made a large  _  with her because the crossing had no  _  ; that is why she owned such a nice car.\nFor weeks I had  _  this woman and her way of life. Now I realize how lucky I am.When you meet a person who seems to be much better off than you don't be  _  appearances.",
