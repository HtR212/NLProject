    "article": "My name is Richie Jewell.I'm 20 years old and I've been diagnosed with autism since the age of 2.I'd like to   _   my story with you about my life with autism.\nFirstly,autism makes me a loner.I can't easily   _   too much human-to-human communication at the same time.I find it difficult to process all that spoken and unspoken information.I also   go through   some other stuff that has been a rocky roadblock during my life.It's very   _   to live through the times that I endured during my life   such as   teasing,struggling to adapt to new   _   like schools,on and off depression,  _   seeing my relative's death and the struggles with my disability.Well despite all of those horrible   _   that tried to cut me down,I have overcome them.\nThose things I mentioned are just a(n)  _   part of my life.  _  ,there are good things in my life.Currently,I work at a local library to get some   _  .Outside of that,I'm a writer and motivational speaker to reach people and   _   their spirits .Now,I'm writing a book titled Through My Eyes:The Richie Jewell Chronicles and 50 Poems,which is about my life and the 50   _   I've written.\nEvery day,there will be   _   challenges that are going to confront me,but I will get stronger as I   _   them.Now,autism can still affect me and I go back into my own little   _   for a short time,then I bring myself back by trying to be as   _   as I can.I have a few   _   to be sociable with people.The first one is to ask others about how their day is going.  Wait for   the reply,and then try to talk about something we have in   _  .\nI am happy to lead an independent life and learn more things each day now and in the future.",
