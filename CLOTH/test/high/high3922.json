    "article": "My mother seemed to be able to make dolls out of anything. She made some dolls for me and my two elder sisters. I  _  playing with them, but still, secretly, I hoped for a store-bought  _  like the one our rich cousin had. Her doll  _  open and close its blue glass eyes and even say \"Mamma\". I  _  stopped admiring it and hoping to have one. However, my dream  _  came true when I was six. One day my father came back from his business trip with three  _  dolls! They were much smaller than our cousin's doll and their eyes were just painted ones, but I did not  care about  such differences. They were  _  \"store-bought\"dolls. We each chose one and I named  _  Misako. Soon my sisters and I became devoted  _  . Our \"children\" kept us  _  all day. We gave them a bath,  dressed  them, brushed their hair, took them out for a walk and put them to bed. Several months later, they got more like real children --their  _  and bodies became dirtier; their dresses got stained; their hair less smooth. But, by then,  my sisters'  interests seemed to have moved into  _  toys. Their dolls were abandoned and in bad condition. One had  _  one of her arms, and  the other  was one-legged. \"You can  take care of  them if you want,\" my sisters said to me. Therefore, I had  _  dolls. They were more or less handicapped and they often looked at me as if they needed me to  _  them. I enjoyed this feeling of being needed --being the only one in the world who could protect them with a lot of love. Indeed, they made the rest of my childhood days very happy.",
