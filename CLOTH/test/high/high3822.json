The girl was   brought up  by her brother since their parents died when the girl was only 4\nyears old. They had  _  all their money, and life was hard\nfor them. But the brother wouldn't let his sister die young. So he made a\nwooden handcart and took his sister to a big provincial hospital.\nThe doctors were   _  by\nthe brother and the sister's close relationship and experiences, so the\nhospital decided to have a kidney  transplantation operation for the girl, completely free of charge. Naturally her brother would   _  one of his\nkidneys. The doctors examined the brother to see if his kidney could match his\nsister's. Everything went well and the  _  time\nwas fixed.\nA doctor asked the brother to come to his office and told him with gestures that they would transplant one of his kidneys to his sister.    _  smile froze on his face.\nThe doctor  _  to him that if his kidney was\ntransplanted successfully, his sister would be  _  ;otherwise, she would die. \nThe mute brother   _  for\none minute and nodded to the doctor seriously.  _  to\neveryone's surprise, the brother disappeared that afternoon. The doctor asked\nXiaoxiao what her brother told her before  _  . Her\nanswer was that he had to go home for some reasons.\nThat made the doctors    _     a lot. Then just before the operation, someone rushed to Xiaoxiao--it was her mute brother, saying something excitedly with gestures. Then, Xiaoxiao burst into   _  . She told doctors that her brother had gone back to plant corns in  _  fields and prepared firewood for her. Because he thought he would die\nafter transplanting his kidney to his sister and would not be able to  look after  her any longer.",
