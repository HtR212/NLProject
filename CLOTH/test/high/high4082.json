The blind girl said that if she could see the world, she would marry him. One day, someone donated a pair of  _  to the blind girl. She could see everything, including her boyfriend. Her boyfriend asked her, \"Now you can see the  _  , will you marry me? \" The girl was surprised when she saw that her boyfriend was  _  ! So she refused to  _  him. Her boyfriend walked away sadly, and later wrote a letter to the girl saying, \"Just take care of my eyes, dear.\" This is how human changes when situations change. Only  few  people remember what life was like before. Only few remember the people who were always there for them. Hold every person close to your heart because you  might  wake up one day and realize that you have lost a diamond( ) while you were too  _  in collecting stones. You learn to love, not by finding a perfect person,  _  by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.",
