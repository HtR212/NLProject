    "article": "(20;l,20) ,A,B,C,D,,. Last night I was driving from Harrisburg to Lewisburg, a  _  of about eighty miles. It was late and I was in a hurry. However, if anyone asked me how fast I was  _  ,I'd say I was not over-speeding. Several times I got  _  behind a slow-moving truck on a narrow road, and I was holding my fists tightly with  _  . At one point along an open highway, I  came to  a crossroad with a traffic light. I was alone on the road by now, but as I  _  the light, it turned red and I braked to a stop. I looked left, right and behind me. Nothing. Not a car, no suggestion of headlights, but there I sat, waiting for the light to  _  , the only human being for at least a mile in any  _  . I started  _  why I refused to run the light. I was not afraid of being  _  , because there was obviously no policeman around, and there certainly would have been no  _  in going through it. Much later that night, after I  met with  a group of my friends in Lewisburg and climbed into bed near midnight, the question of why I'd stopped for that light  came back to  me, I think I stopped because it's part of a contract we all have with each other. It's not only the  _  , but it's an arrangement we have, and we trust each other to  _  it: we don't go through red lights. Like most of us, I'm more likely to be  _  from doing something bad by the social convention that  disapproves of  it than by any law against it. It's amazing that we ever  _  each other to do the right thing, isn't it? And we do, too, Trust is our  _  preference. I was so  _  of myself for stopping for the red light that night.",
