At last he heard the slight, steady rhythm of approaching hooves coming along the frozen path. Anxiously, he  _  as several horsemen came around the bend . He let the first one  pass by  . Then another, and another. Finally, as the  _  rider neared the spot where the old man sat like a snow statue, the old man  _  the rider's eye and said, \"Sir, would you mind giving an old man a ride to the other side? There doesn't appear to be a passage way by  _  .\" The rider replied, \"Sure.\" Seeing the old man was unable to  _  his half-frozen body from the ground, the horseman got down and helped the old man onto the horse. The horseman took the old man not just across the river, but to his destination. As they neared the tiny but cozy cottage, the horseman's  _  caused him to ask, \"Sir, I notice that you let several other riders go by without making a(n)  _  to get a ride. Then I came up and you  _  asked me for a ride. I'm curious why, on such a bitter winter night, you would wait and ask the last rider.  What if  I had refused and left you there?\" The old man replied, \"I've been  _  here for some time.

But when I looked into your eyes,  _  was evident. I knew,  then and there  , that your gentle spirit would  _  the opportunity to give me help in my time of  _  .\" Those heartwarming comments  _  the horseman deeply. \"I'm most grateful for what you have said,\" he told the old man. \"May I never get too busy in my own affairs that I  _  to respond to the needs of others with kindness and compassion.\" With that, Thomas Jefferson turned his horse around and made his way back to the White House.",
