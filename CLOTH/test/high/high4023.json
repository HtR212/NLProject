When you  _  to give support to others, it is usually a   _  that you are also stopping giving support to yourself.\nOne of my friends, Donna, told me a story recently that clearly showed the  _  of support. Several years ago, Donna had just  broken up with  her boyfriend of two years and she was having a very  _  time, accepting the loss. She refused to be   _   and stayed at home alone, which certainly was not helping. She just couldn't   _  crying all the time.\nEarly one morning, Donna received a phone call with some   _  news: a car accident had  _  her best friend's brother's life. Donna had known this friend, Mary, and her brother  _   her entire life, and the news was destructive. Donna   _  her sadness and got in the car as soon as possible, driving to her friend's house to be with her. During the funeral, Donna held Mary close while she cried, sat by her and slept   next to   Mary's bed to make sure she did not wake up alone in the middle of the night. During that time she hardly felt any  _   in her heart. Several weeks later, when life began to return to   _  , Donna realized the level of support she had given Mary far overtook any support she had   _  herself during her dark time. She was able to use the support she had given her friend as a   _  for the support she needed.\nWhen you find yourself unable to support someone else,  look into   yourself and see if there is something within yourself that is not supporting.   On the contrary  , when you give complete support to others, it will mirror those places within you that require the same level of attention.",
