They lived in a big house close to the  _  . I like that area very much, because there is a cinema, a swimming pool and a  _  .\nI got along very well with Joan. We shared many  _  interests. Almost every day, we went swimming in the swimming pool. Sometimes we swam in the sea if the  _  was nice. We went to the zoo and I really  _  seeing those wild animals and the  _  ones. I saw those cute koalas and kangaroos, but I didn't get close to them  _  people said actually koalas were not as gentle as they  _  . They might bite people. We also went to the cinema a couple of times and I really liked the films there.\nWe visited Sydney on a sunny day. Brisbane is about 1 000 kilometres  _  from Sydney, so it's not a short distance.  _  , we went there by plane. The journey by plane was quite fast and  _   and it took us only two hours to get there. When I got  _  the plane, I was so excited to see this modern city. The next day, we visited the famous Sydney Opera House. It was amazing!\nThe  _  in Sydney was absolutely beautiful and the food there was well-cooked. My favourite was sea fish. The Smiths were very nice to me. They even  _  me to some very expensive lobster . That was the first time I  had eaten  lobster, and I  _  say it was really delicious.\nThe whole trip was very enjoyable  _  the last day. We planned to go boating on the sea. However, it rained the whole day. We  _  in the hotel that day and chatted. In the end, we decided to go back to Brisbane by  _  , because the ticket was cheaper and also we could enjoy the scenery outside the train windows.\nOn the whole, I really had a great time in Australia. It was a  _  trip. I'd like to go back there again!",
