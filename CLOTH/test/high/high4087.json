    "article": "In 1971, a young man who grew up very poor was travelling across the country, trying to make a new   _   for himself. Along the way, he had   _   run out of money and was forced to spend the night in his car. This  _  until one morning, after a week of sleeping in his car, he walked  _  into a restaurant and ordered a big breakfast.\nAfter eating his first good meal in  _  , he found himself  _  to the waiter, telling him he had lost his  _  . The waiter, who was also the owner, walked  _  the chair where the young man had been sitting. He bent down,  picked up  it had fallen on the floor and said, \"Son, you must have  as if  this,\" the owner said. The young man couldn't believe his  _  ! He quickly paid for the breakfast, left a  _  , bought gas with the change, and headed West.\nOn the way out of town, he began to understand  _  the fellow did. Maybe nobody dropped the money  at all  . \"Maybe that fellow just knew I was  in trouble  and he helped me in a way that didn't   _   me.\" Right then he made a promise to help others if he could.\nLater, he worked very hard and became a rich man. Now, he lives near Kansas City. Each year he  gives away  thousands of dollars. He is known as the \"Secret Santa\" because at  Christmas  time each year, he personally hands money out to those on the streets and at hospitals. \"I've lived the story, so I know it certainly more blessed  to give than to   _  , because it comes back to you many many times over,\" he says. \"It restores some faith in humanity.\"",
