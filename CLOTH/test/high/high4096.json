    "article": "Teenagers at one German school are learning how to achieve happiness alongside other traditional  _  such as maths and languages. The class sits in a circle with their eyes shut and they count from one to ten: someone starts, the  _  voice comes from the far right, a third from the other side. The aim of the game is to  _  for an opportunity to shout out the  _  without clashing with another voice or leaving a pause. On the first try,  _  of the young Germans try to be first, while a few are too shy to join in. But by the fifth  _  , they develop a rhythm . The message gives other people space but also claims your own. This is a requirement for social well-being. Unlike schools in other nations, German schools do not usually have school sports teams or seek to build school spirit. Many teens admit they are  _  and confused, but school is not usually the place to find relief. The Willy Hellpach School in Heidelberg is the first in the nation to develop a happiness  _  It is  _  for 17-19years old students to prepare for university entrance exams. \"The course isn't there to make you happy,\" Ernst Fritz-Schubert, the school principal, warned pupils, \"  _  rather to help you discover the ways to become happy. \" Cooking a meal together will be one of the class  _  , along with improving body language under the  _  of two professional actresses. The course is taught for three periods a week. Despite the happy subject, the pupils themselves insist it is no laughing matter. \"In the first period, we had to each say something  _  about another member of the class and about ourselves. No laughing at people or teasing,\" said Fanny, 17. The message is that self-esteem improves  _  too. Research by the school shows it is not the first to start happiness classes and they also exist at some US universities, but are mainly based on positive thinking, using  _  from studies of depression. \"That would be too one-sided for us. We want to show how decent food or exercise can help too,\" the principal said.",
