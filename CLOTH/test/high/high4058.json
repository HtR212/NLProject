    "article": "Life was hard, and Cam was broke as he had lost his job as a DJ. He had no cash on him but a brand-new dollar bill with all the autographs of the Opry stars, which he  _  carefully and carried with him always.\nOne morning, he saw a young man  _  quietly in an old yellow Dodge in the parking lot. Cam waved to him and drove away. When he went back to the parking lot that night, he noticed the car again, parked in the  _  space. This car had not moved.\nThe next morning, as Cam walked near the car, the man  _  his window down,  _  himself and said he had been in his car for days with no money or food. Then, very  _  , the man asked if he might borrow a dollar for a snack to get him by until the next day. Cam explained his  _  that he didn't have a dollar to lend him. He walked to his car, wishing he could have  _  him.\nThen Cam suddenly  _  his Grand Ole Opry dollar. He  _  with his conscience  a minute or two, pulled his wallet out and  _  the bill. Then he walked back to the man and gave him his  _  dollar, \"Somebody has  _  all over this,\" the man said, but he didn't notice that the writing was dozens of  _  . He took the bill.\nThat very morning when Cam was back home trying not to  think about  what he had done, things began to happen. The phone rang; a recording studio wanted him to do a commercial that paid $ 500, which  _  like a million. In the next few days more  _  came to him out of nowhere. Good things kept coming  _  .\nCam  _  saw the man in the old yellow Dodge again. But whether the guy was a  _  or an angel doesn't matter.",
