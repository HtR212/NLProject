    "article": "I used to hate being called upon in class mainly because I didn't like attention drawn to myself. And  _  otherwise assigned a seat by the teacher, I always  _  to sit at the back of the classroom.\nAll this  _  after I joined a sports team. It began when a teacher suggested I try out for the basketball team. At first I thought it was a crazy  _  because I didn't have a good sense of balance, nor did I have the  _  to keep pace with the others on the team and they would tease me. But for the teacher who kept insisting on my \"  _  for it\", I wouldn't have decided to give it a try.\nGetting up the courage to go to the tryouts was only the  _  of it! When I first started  _  the practice sessions, I didn't even know the rules of the game, much  _  what I was doing. Sometimes I'd get  _  and take a shot at the wrong direction--which made me feel really stupid.  _  , I wasn't the only one \"new\" at the game, so I decided to  _  on learning the game, do my best at each practice session, and not to be too hard on myself for the things I didn't  _  \"just yet\".\nI practiced and practiced. Soon I knew the  _  and the \"moves\". Being part of a team was fun and motivating. Very soon the competitive  _  in me was winning over my lack of confidence. With time, I learned how to play and made friends in the  _  --friends who respected my efforts to work hard and be a team player. I never had so much fun!\nWith my  _  self-confidence comes more praise from teachers and classmates. I have gone from \"  _  \"in the back of the classroom and not wanting to call attention to myself,  _  raising my hand--even when I sometimes wasn't 100 percent  _  I had the right answer. Now I have more self-confidence in myself.",
