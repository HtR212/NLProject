His teacher, Doris Miller, became  _  with him.  _  , she decided to try some more.\nWhen spring came, Doris told the children the story of Jesus. Then she gave  _  of them a box, and asked them to put something inside that  _  new life.\nThe next morning, it was time to  _  the boxes. In the first box, Doris found a flower. \"Oh yes, a (an)  _  is certainly a sign of new life,\" she said. \"When it grows through the  _  , we know that spring is coming.\" The next box contained a plastic butterfly, which  _  very real. \"We all know that a caterpillar    _  into a beautiful butterfly. Yes, that is new life, too.\"\nThen Doris opened the third box, and was  _  to find nothing!  _  it must be Jeremy's, she thought. And obviously Jeremy had not  _  her instructions. She felt very  _  for not having  _  the \"task\" to him. She did not want to make Jeremy feel ashamed,  _  she quietly set the box aside an  _  for another.\nSuddenly Jeremy said, \"Miss Miller, aren't you going to talk about my box?\" Doris replied, \"But Jeremy, your box is  _  !\" He looked into her eyes and said softly, \"Yes, but so was Jesus' tomb! You told us that he brought new life.\" Doris was so  _  that she couldn't speak. Jeremy remembered  _  she had told them.",
