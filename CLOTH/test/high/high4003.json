    "article": "Last November, Nick heard a disorder at a party. A group of people had  _  outside, pointing at something floating in the Bay. As he ran to  _  , he soon saw what was wrong: Two kids in a boat were caught in the  _  and being pulled out to sea. Tim and Jack had climbed into a boat anchored nearby and had rowed out to  _  a football. Reaching beyond the calm waters, the  umbrella  fitted to the boat caught the wind and pulled it into open water. They tried to row back. But they were no  _  for the wind and turned around in circles. Nick dashed to the farthest of land. The boat was already just a  _  on the sea. He knew that the  _  boat would soon be overtaken by the huge waves, and that it was 2 degrees. Nick jumped into the  _  cold water. Every 90 yards, he raised his head to assess his  _  . At one point, he considered turning back before managing to yell to them, \"Take down the umbrella!\" Tim battled with the ropes holding the umbrella. Finally he loosened the ropes and  _  the umbrella. Then Nick caught up, but soon waves crashed over the boat, which began to sink. Nick  _  it would be faster to pull them toward the nearest bank. They  _  wore life jackets , which Nick held in one hand, swimming  _  .\"Are we there?\" they asked repeatedly. \"Yes,\" Nick  _  them each time. It was 30 minutes before they got to the bank and stayed as close as possible for  _  . Worn out, Nick had hardly arrived when he  passed out  .It was an hour later when he found himself in a hospital that he came to. Asked what it took him to make the  _  move, he replied: It is  _  to step out of the comfort zone. Being an onlooker is a cautious existence, but  _  we should never be stuck in. Stand by or stand up.",
