    "article": "Many years ago, I went to  pick up  my mother from work in the afternoon. I got there a little early so I parked the car by the road and waited for her.\nAs I looked outside the car window to my right, there was a small park where I  _  a little boy, around one and a half to two years old,  _  freely on the grass as his mother watched from a short distance. The boy had a big smile on his face  as if  he had just been set free from some sort of prison. The boy would then fall to the grass, get up, and without  _  or without looking back at his mother, run as fast as he could, again, still with a smile on his face. It seemed  _  had happened!\nFor kids,  _  at an early age, when they fall down, they don't regard their falling down as a  _  ;instead, they treat it as a learning experience. They feel compelled to try and try again until they succeed. The answer must be that they have not  _  \"falling down\" with the word \"failure\" yet, thus they don' t know how to feel the state which accomparues failure. Therefore, they are not  _  in any way. In addition, they probably think to themselves that it's perfectly okay to fall down, and that it's not wrong to do so.  In other words  , they give themselves permission to make mistakes. Thus they remain energetic.\nTouched as I was by the boy's  _  , I was equally touched by the manner in which he ran. With each attempt, he looked so  _  and natural. No  _  of fear and nervousness.\nHis only aim was to run freely and to do it as  _  as he could. He was just being a child-just being himself - being completely in the moment. He was not looking for  _  or was not worrying about whether someone was  _  or not. He wasn't concerned about being judged. He didn't seem to be bothered by the fact that maybe someone would see him fall ( as there were others in the park apart from him and his mother) and that it would be  _  if he did fall. No, all that  _  to him was to accomplish the task or activity at hand to the best of his ability. To run and to feel the experience of running fully and freely. I  _  a lot from that observation and experience, and have successfully brought that lesson with me in my many pursuits in life.",
