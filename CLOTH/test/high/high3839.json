    "article": "It is dark now when I begin my early morning walk in the woods. And now that autumn has marched into winter, darkness persists well beyond my 6 a.m. start time.\nPaths have become familiar after years of hiking. But rocks and tree roots have magically appeared from previously  _  ground.\nCertainly I hit my toe against or  _  on some unseen barriers. Fallen branches from last night's storm  _  in wait. Layers of autumn leaves create a false floor through which my trusting footsteps  _  . Sometimes a piece of moon donates some  _  to the mystery path. But when skies are dark, there are no  _  clues for where I step.\nMy very first night hike was during summer camp on a warm August night in the woods. Our leader  _  bright flashlights so we would not scare away the night creatures we hoped to find.\n\"See with your  _  ,\" the leader told us over and over again.\n  _  , that advice took effect. With  _  and courage, it didn't take long before our feet became  _  to the ground's textures  and irregularities. Toes learned to  _  for barriers before trusting full weight on feet. Holes and dips in the ground were detected in  _  of possible fall...\nBut mistakes  _  happen. My foot gets caught on a trip and I fall. Since the pace is  _  , there is little damage except to pride. Once  _  , I pause to feel the firmness of earth beneath me.\nOn my way home, as dawn  makes way for   day, I think about how similar night hikes are to journeys through life.\nThe same rules often  _  for both: slow down, concentration, \"see\" with new senses -- and don't be  _  . Although the path is full of  _  -- hidden barriers, false surface, wet floor -- the earth is solid and firm beneath. It is the nature of night ground. It is the nature of life.",
