One day I was in a taxi and we headed  _  the airport. We were driving in the right lane  _  suddenly a black car drove out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver slammed on his brakes, slide sideways, and at the very last moment our car stopped and narrowly  _  the other car by just inches!The driver of the other car looked around and started  _  at us. My taxi driver just  _  and waved at the guy. And I mean he was really  _  . So I asked, \"Why did you just do that? This guy almost ruined your car and sent us to the hospital!\"This is when my taxi driver taught me what I now call \"The Law of the Garbage Truck\". He  _  that many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of  _  , full of frustration, full of anger, and full of disappointment. As their garbage  _  up, they need a place to dump it and sometimes they'll dump it on  _  . Don't take it personally. Just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on. Believe me. You'll be more  _  . Don't take their garbage and  _  it to other people at work, at home, or on the streets, Life's too short to wake up in the morning with  _  . The mark of your success is how quickly you can refocus on what's  _  in your life. Roy Baumeister, a psychology researcher from Florida State University, found in his extensive research that you  _  bad things more often than good things in your life. You store the bad memories rather easily, and you  _  them more frequently. So...Love the people who treat you right. Ignore the ones who don't. Life is ten percent what you make it and ninety percent how you  _  it! When you follow \"The Law of the Garbage Truck\", you take back control of your life. You make room for the good by  _  go of the bad. Have a Garbage Free Day!Have a marvelous, garbage-free day!The seeds you plant today  _  the harvest you reap tomorrow.",
