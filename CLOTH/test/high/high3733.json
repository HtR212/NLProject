I am afraid that Edmund has been  _  in his mental powers since he  went away  .\"\nThe judge said : \" Edmund, were there any witnesses who could  _  that you gave the ring to Oswald ?\"\nEdmund replied : \"  _  in the field where we were at the time there was nobody. We were talking beneath an old oak tree and there we were  _  .\"\nOswald said : \" I know as little of the oak tree as I do of the ring .\"\nThe judge said : \" Edmund , go to that  _  again and bring back a branch of that oak tree. Oswald ,you wait here in the meantime,  _  Edmund comes back .\"\nSo Edmund left. After some time the judge said  to Oswald: \"How is it that Edmund is taking so long to  _  ?
