    "article": "I was so thrilled and a little frightened when I began to be a student in a kindergarten. The large classroom was full of books and toys, the two things I  _  . I had been always interested in them. But it was also full of kids all  _  than me. Because my birthday was in late September, I was bound to be the youngest kid in my class until 7th grade.\nI think that my mom realized I was a little  _  . That was why she was always there to  _  me up right after school when I could have  _  taken the school bus like my classmates did. I would get on and take the front seat next to her and tell her all about my  _  . Sometimes we would even read a book and wait  _  all the cars and buses had left before we  _  home. I cherished those  _  times when I had my mom all to myself. I felt so  _  and peaceful when we sat in the car together. Beginning the new challenge of  _  didn't seem so difficult when I knew that I could   _  my happiness and sadness with her. Being a tiny, little kid in a scary world wasn't so  _  either. I knew that my mom loved me and that was all I  _  to be loving, joyful and strong.\nAs I  look back on  those happy times, now I can see that they also  _  me for another special relationship I would find later in life. All those times I spent  _  to and being with my mother helped me  _  my heart to the world. Her beautiful love helped me  _  to love. Her comforting arms guided me to comfort others. Mom, I love you forever and will be always  _  to you for what you gave and taught me!",
