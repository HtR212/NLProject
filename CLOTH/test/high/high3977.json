It is the same with the challenges that come with  _  . When we are faced with a challenge, we usually have two  _  . We can try to beat it off, or we can decide that the thing  _  the challenge isn't worth the  _  and call it quits. Although there are certainly  _  when calling it quits is the right thing to do, in most  _  all that is needed is  _  and communication. When we are committed to something, it means that no matter how  _  or how uncomfortable something is, we will always choose to  _  it and work it through instead of running away from it. Communication is making a  _  for discussion and talking about how you feel as opposed to just saying what the other person did wrong.  _  you can say to a friend, \"I got my feeling hurt,\"  rather than  \"You hurt my feelings,\" you are going to be able to solve the problem much faster. In dealing with the many challenges that friendship will bring to you, try to see them for  _  they are: small hurdles you need to jump or  get through  on your way through life. Nothing is so big that it is  _  to get over, and hurt only  _  to make us stronger. It is all part of growing up, it  _  to everyone, and some day you will  look back on  all of this and say, \"Hard as it was, it made me who I am today. And that is a good thing.\"",
