He flew into the water, not  _  that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator  was swimming toward the   _  . His mother, who was looking out of the\nwindow in the house, saw the two as they got closer and closer together. In\nutter fear, she ran toward the water, crying to her son as  _  as\nshe could.\n  Hearing her voice, the little boy became alarmed and swam  _  to his mother. It was too late. Just as he  _  her,\nthe alligatorsnatched  him.\nThe mother grabbed her little boy by the arms just as the alligator snatchedhis legs. The alligator was much  _  than\nthe mother, but the mother tried her best not to let go. A farmer happened to  _  by, heard her screams, raced from his truck and shot the alligator.\nFortunately, after weeks in the hospital, the little boy  _  . His legs were extremely\nscarred by the  _  of the animal and, on his arms, were deep\nscratches    _  his mother's fingernails dug into his flesh in her  _  to\nsave the son she loved.\n  The newspaper reporter who  _  the boy asked if\nhe would  _  him his scars. The boy lifted his  _  . And then, with\nobvious  _  , he said to the reporter. \"But look at my arms.\nI have great scars on my arms, too. I have them because my mom wouldn't let\ngo.\"\n  We have scars, too, not from an alligator, or   _  quite so dramatic ,   _  the scars of a painful past. Some of those scars\nare unsightly and have caused us deep regret.\n  But, some  _  are because love has\nrefused to let go. In the midst of your struggle, she's been there  _  on\nto you.",
