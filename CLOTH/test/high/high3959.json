    "article": "It was my birthday last Thursday. I decided to  _  by inviting a few friends out to supper. I chose a restaurant in a  _  part of town. It is one of my favorite restaurants because the food is good and the waiters are friendly. It is  _  ever crowded, because not many people know about it, so it is not usually  _  to book a table. In any case, Thursday is not a busy evening  as usual  . When we entered the restaurant, we were surprised to find it completely  _  . I looked around but no  _  was free. One of the waiters recognized me. He came across and explained the situation. \"A party of tourists came in about half an hour ago,\" he said. \"It was like an invasion .  _  the place was full! We can hardly manage (,).\" The waiter then pointed to a table in the corner. \"The people there are about to  _  ,\" he said. \"Just hold on and you'll  _  a place there.\" He was right. Fifteen minutes later, the people  _  the corner table paid their  _  , got up and left. I led my friends across and we all sat down.  _  , our table was almost out of sight. We tried to call the attention of the waiter who sent us there,  _  he, like all the other waiters, was  _  with the party of tourists. They ordered lots of food. At last, an hour later, the tourists were finishing their meal and looking very  _  with life. The waiter, now very tired, appeared at our table. I advised my friends about the best dishes and finally the waiter went off with our  _  . A few moments later he returned to our table. We could tell from his face that he had  _  news for us.  _  a little sorry he told us that there was no meat or fish. \"All we can  _  you,\" he said, \"is an omelet !\"",
