    "article": "Since finishing my studies at Harvard and Oxford, I've watched one friend after another land high-ranking, high-paying Wall Street jobs. As executives   with banks, consulting firms, established law firms, and major corporations, many are now 41 _  on their way to impressive careers. By society's 42 _ , they seem to have it made.\nOn the surface, these people seem to be very lucky in life. As they left student life behind, many had a 43 _  drink at their cheap but friendly local bar, shook hands with longtime roommates, and 44 _  out of small apartments into high buildings. They made reservations at restaurants where the cost of a bottle of wine 45 _  a college year's monthly rent. They replaced their beloved old cars with expensive new sports cars.\nThe thing is, a number of them have 46 _  that despite their success, they aren't happy. Some 47 _  of unfriendly coworkers and feel sad for eight-hour workweeks devoted to tasks they 48 _ . Some do not respect the companies they work for and talk of feeling tired and 49 _ . However, instead of devoting themselves to their work, they find themselves working to support the 50 _  to which they have so quickly become 51 _ .\nPeople often speak of trying a more satisfying path, and 52 _  in the end the idea of leaving their jobs to work for something they 53 believe in  or finding a position that would give them more time with their families almost always leads them to the same conclusion: it's 54 _ . They have loans, bills, a mortgage to 55 pay off , retirement to save for. They recognize there's something 56 _  in their lives, but it's 57 _  to step off the track.\nIn a society that tends to 58 _  everything in terms of dollars and cents, we learn from a young age to consider the costs of our 59 _  in financial terms. But what about the personal and social costs 60 _  in pursuing money over meaning? These are exactly the kinds of costs many of us tend to ignore -- and the very ones we need to consider most.",
