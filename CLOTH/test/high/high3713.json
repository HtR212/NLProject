I hope you don't have to face these too much, but such things  _  . Be open to life anyway. You'll find cruelty and  _  in your journey through life, but don't let that  _  you back from finding new things. Don't retreat from life, and don't  _  or wall yourself off. Be open to new things, new experiences, and new people. You will  _  many times, but if you allow that to stop you from trying, you will  _  many chances. Do remember failure is a stepping stone to  _  . You will meet many people who will try to do  _  than you, in school, in college, and at work. They'll try to have nicer cars, bigger houses, nicer clothes, and so on. To  _  , life is a competition. However, I believe life is a(n)  _  . If you always try your best to  _  others, you are wasting your life. Learn to enjoy your life  _  and you will make it a journey of  _  , of learning and of love. Finally, know that I love you and always will. You are  _  a really wonderful journey, and I will always be there for you. Love, Dad",
