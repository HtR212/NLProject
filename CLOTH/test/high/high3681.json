He loved the sea and would stay out until he caught enough to  _   the family.\nWhen we met   _  weather, he would drive me to school with his old truck. And after we arrived, he would bend over and give me a 13 _ on the face and then tell me to be a good boy. I always felt very shy in front of so many other  _  . I was already a twelve-year-old young man, but my father still kissed me goodbye!\nThen on a rainy day I  _  to tell him my feeling. When we stopped at the school gate, the   _   big smile appeared on my father's face. I   _  what would happen next. I  _  put my hand up and for the first time said \"No\" to him. The smile on his face immediately changed into a19 _  look. He looked at me for a long time, and tears began to appear in his eyes. I was shocked. I had never   _   him cry! Then he said, \"You're right. You are a big boy.. a man. I won't kiss you any more. \"\nNot long after that, my dad went to the sea on a bad day. Most of the  _   stayed at home,but not Dad, because he had a big family to feed. But after that day, he  _  came back. Later his boat was found with its nets half in and half out. He must have 23 _ a strong wind and was trying to save the nets.\nHow I wished I hadn't   _  my father's kiss! And from this I have learnt that we should take every chance with our family and friends as the last one in our lives. We can have   _  regrets   by doing this.",
