Carrying a plastic shopping bag of my personal things, I moved in a(n)  _  way to my car, and drove home crying. I had just been  _  .\nFor following weeks, I was troubled by the  _  of that sudden lay-off: What about the people who would be  _  by my abandoned projects? Would I have a chance to get another job?  _  with anxiety, shame and sudden outbursts of tears, I felt completely  _  . \"What should I do next?\" I asked myself.\nOne day, over dinner with my good friend Sophia in a restaurant, I told her about my  _  , \"Being fired came as a  _  . I am not a bad person. I don't know  _  it happened to me. In fact, I was so hard-working and  _  to my company\". After listening to my words, she  _  me, \"Never be so depressed. Being fired isn't the same thing as being bad. There are lots of  _  that we cannot escape in life, and we have to face them  _  and find solutions. I think you should make some changes to help you  deal with  this issue. Unemployment just means a new start.\" Her words gave me a lot of confidence and strength, which  _  me to take action to change the bad situation. I had a firm belief that everything would hopefully  turn out  fine.\nThen a long journey of applying for new jobs began. In addition, I made a decision -- starting to  _  the people who helped me either with the emotional support of my unemployment or in my search for a new job. I would send each of them a thank-you card. Sophia had helped me a lot, and she got my first card.\nExpressing gratitude is the best thing that I have done to  _  my negative thoughts and move forward. Fortunately, I have got a(n)  _  job that fits my skills and interests. No matter what happens in the future, I will  _  this wonderful decision and show more people my thanks.",
