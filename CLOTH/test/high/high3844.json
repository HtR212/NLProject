    "article": "My mind seems always to return to the day when I met Carl. I got on a bus, and  looked for  a place to sit.  At last  , I spotted a place near the back.\nThe occupant( ) of the  _  next to the one I was going for was an older man. Taking the seat next to the man, I began to read the  _  I 'd been carrying. The man   _  next to me introduced himself by asking if I 'd read any other books like the one I was  _  holding. When I told him I had, he seemed to become interested, and, to tell the truth,  _  did I.\nHis name was Carl. He told me about how he loved jazz music and we  _  many stories and a lot of laughs. Carl and I talked about a lot of different things. The more we talked, the more  _  we became at how much the two of us really had  in common  ,despite   the age  _  . Finally, Carl happily  got off  at his stop. I haven't seen him since then, but the thought of our  _  that day never leaves my mind.\nCarl really makes me think about how much we can learn from each other  _  we just  break through  the barriers   we've got. I mean, I would have  _  thought before that day that I could have anything in common with someone so much  _  than I . But Carl  _  me no matter how old we are ,we are just people, and we should make an extra  _  to try and get to know our neighbors and people we see every day. If we all took the time to try to  _  each other, the world would be a much better place.",
