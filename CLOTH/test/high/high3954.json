    "article": "This little story I'm about to tell you happened when I was about 11 years old, and I'II never forget it. I was at my friend Jenny's  _  after school one day, and we were doing (or not doing) homework..  _  I was there, Jenny's mom came over to visit. I don't remember her name  _  what her face looked like. I just remember her hands, her voice and the  _  she taught me. I can still see her hand  reaching out  for mine in our introduction.  _  were so beautiful, I thought; rich, dark skin  _  complemented by the orange colored polish on her nails. Then I  _  her saying, and not at all in a condescending  _  .\"Oh no, that is NOT how you shake hands. Let me show you  _  .\" After that, I just remember her voice  _  the importance of a good handshake, conveying a positive sense of self, looking at  the other  person in the eye, making that first moment matter...I think in that exchange I first understood  _  . I respected her for  _  the time to teach me about one of those subtleties in life. I appreciated the fact  _  she didn't look down upon me because I was 11 or because I didn't know something. And so because of that I felt somewhat respected. I mean the  _  she treated me. It felt good to be  talked to  like a real person. I also appreciate her idea that  if  someone doesn't pay attention to something, be patient and point him or her  _  the right direction. I  think of  her every time I meet someone and shake hands. And I'm so thankful for her little lesson.",
