Communicating with her was  _  because everything she wanted to say to me had to be written on a notepad. As a nursing graduate, I was able to  _  her mind by observing even a slight  _  in a patient's facial expression. One day, when I was checking the patient, she  _  me on the shoulder to show me a note, \"Do you think I could be let go  _  the hospital in a month to see my niece get married? Taking her hand in mine, I told her that I could not  _  her,because I did not want to leave her a  _  sense of hope.  _  , I made her believe that I would be there with her every step of the way on her journey toward  _  . Hearing that, the patient gave me a  _  and a hug. Day by day, I built her  _  by walking around the floor with her. As I did this, I could see before my own eyes that her health was  _  improving and able to walk more steadily. On her last day in hospital, just before her niece's  _  , she wrote me one last note, \"I couldn't have done this  _  you; I love you.\" After kissing goodbye, I had a strong sense of achievement. I realized that moments like this were  _  I woke up early for  _  in the hospital and spent long hours with her. I truly felt, and her  _  confirmed, that I was an  _  part of this woman's recovery. My experience with this patient shows me that this career allows me to touch the  _  of people in ways that people in other  _  will never get to experience.",
