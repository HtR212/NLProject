Soon the three pots came to a   _  . He placed carrots, eggs, and coffee beans into them   _  . He let them boil, without   _   a word.\nIn half a(n)   _   he walked over to the stove and   turned off   the fire. He pulled out the carrots and the eggs, ladled out the   _   and put them in three different bowls. He brought her closer and asked her to   _   the carrots. They were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and   _   it. She pulled off the shell and observed the hard-boiled egg.   _  , he asked her to sip  the coffee. She   _  , as she tasted its rich aroma .\n\"What does it mean, Father?\" she asked.\n\"Each of them faced the same difficult situation, 212 degrees of boiling water.\" he explained, \"However, each   _   differently.
