They can be used to  _  a note to a report turned in to a teacher. They can even be used to post a reminder note in a place where it will be  _  . Many people question how they were invented. The  _  is surprising because the discovery was actually a(n)  _  .\nIn 1968,  _  Spencer Silver was working with different types of adhesives  . He was trying to develop new  _  for a company that created and sold clear tape. One particular adhesive just would not  _  for long periods of time,  _  it could be peeled off easily. He passed the  _  around the company to see if anyone could find a(n)  _  for it. Nobody could imagine a way to use an adhesive that did not stick to a  _  permanently.\nSix years later, Art Fry, another scientist with the same company, became frustrated while  _  with his choir  . The piece of paper he used to mark his place on his music kept  falling out  . Fry wished he had something that would make the paper stay in place.  _  , he remembered the  _  adhesive Dr. Silver had passed around. Fry wondered, \"Would it be possible to use the adhesive?\"\nIt turned out to be quite  _  ! Applying the adhesive to the back of a piece of paper made the paper stick wherever it was placed.  _  , it didn't stick permanently. The paper could be easily  _  . Thus, the sticky note was born.",
