My husband was ordered out on a long-term duty,and I was left in a tiny shack  alone. The heat was  _  -almost 125 0F even in the shade of a cactus . 24 _  a soul to talk to . The wind blew non-stop ,and all the food I ate ,and the evry air I breathed,were  _   with sand , sand , sand !\nI was so sorry for myself that I wrote to my parents. I told them I was  giving up   and coming back home.I said I couldn't stand it one minute longer. I  would rather   be in prison! My father answered my  _    with just two lines-two lines that will always sing in my  _   - two lines that completely changed my life :\nTwo men looked out from prison bars\nOne saw the mud ,the other saw the stars\nI read those two lines  over and over  I was ashamed of myself. I made up my mind I would find out what was good in my present  _  ; I would look for the stars. \nI made friends with the natives,and their  _  amazed me. They gave me presents of their favorite artworks which they had   _  to sell to toueists . I studied the delightful forms of the cactus .I watched for the desert sunsets,and  _   for seashells that had been left there millions of years ago when the desert had been an ocean   _  \nWhat brought about this  _  change in me ? The desert hadn't changed ,   _  I had .I had changed my  _  And by doing so ,I changed an unhappy experience into the most amazing  _    of my life . I was excited by this new world that I had dicovered I had looked out of my self-creatded prison and   _  the stars",
