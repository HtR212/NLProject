My mother  insisted on  knowing where we were at all times and who our friends were . She insisted if we said we'd be gone an hour, then we be gone one hour or  _  --not one hour and one minute.She made us wear the clothes made by herself,just to  _  money.Now you can see how  _  she was. The  _  is yet to come. We had to be in bed by 9:00 each night and  _  at 7:45 the next morning.We had to wash dishes.  _  beds,and learn to cook.I believe she lay  _  at night thinking up mean things to do to us. Through the years,things didn't  _  a bit.We could not lie in bed,pretending to be\"  _  \"like our friends did to miss school.Our friends'report cards had beautiful colors on them,black for passing,red for  _  .My mother,  _  ,would only be content with black marks. As the years  _  by,we graduated from high school.Out of the four children,a couple of us  _  !higher education than university level.With our mother  _  us pushing and demanding,  _  of us was allowed to drop out of school.She forced us to grow up into educated and honest adults. Now I'm trying to  _  my three children.I'm filled with  _  when my children call me mean.Because,you see,I thank God,he gave me the meanest mother in the whole world.",
