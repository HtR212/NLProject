    "article": "Valentine's Day is a popular festival of love and romance. There are  _  legends associated with the festival along with the belief that birds began to mate from this day. Historians trace its  _  to an ancient Roman festival. It is said that in ancient Rome, people  _  a holiday on February 14th to honor Juno--the Queen of Roman Gods and Goddesses. On the following day, February 15th,the festival of Lupercalia was celebrated to honor the Roman God of Agriculture. An interesting  _  was followed on the festival of Lupercalia to bring together young boys and girls who otherwise were strictly  _  . On the eve of the festival, names of young Roman girls were written on a slip of paper and placed into jars. Each young man  drew out  a girl's name from the jar and was paired with the girl during the festival. Sometimes the  _  lasted for a year until next year's celebration. Quite often,the couple would fall in love with each other and  _  marry. The custom lasted for a long time until people felt that it was un-Christian and that mates should be chosen by sight, not  _  . The pairing of young boys and girls set the mood of the Valentine's Day Festival as we know today. But it was  _  due to the efforts and daring of a priest St Valentine that the festival got its  _  and clearer meaning. The story goes that Emperor Claudius II of Rome found it  _  to get soldiers and felt the reason why men did not join the  _  was that they did not wish to leave their wives and families. As a result, Claudius cancelled all marriages and engagements in Rome. St Valentine challenged Claudius's  _  order and secretly married couples. When his disobedience was  _  ,Valentine was put to death on February 14, around 270 AD. After his death Valentine was named a saint.",
