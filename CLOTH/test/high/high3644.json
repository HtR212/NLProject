    "article": "A policeman was walking along the street. In the doorway of a shop, a man was standing in the   _   light, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth. The policeman   slowed down   and then walked up to the man.\n\"I'm just waiting for a friend here,\" the man said \"It's a(n)   _   made twenty years ago.\" The man struck a match and   _   his cigar. The light   _   a pale face with a little white scar  near his right eye. \"Twenty years ago tonight, when I said goodbye to Jimmy Wells, my best friend to   _   for the West to make my fortune, we   _   we would meet here again exactly twenty years  _  that date and time.\" \"I hope your friend will come around soon.\" said the policeman,   moving away  .\nTwenty minutes later, a(n) tall man hurried across the street. He went directly to the waiting man. \"Is that you, Bob?\" he asked. \"Jimmy Wells?\"   _   the man with excitement. \"You have   _  , Jimmy. I never thought you were so tall.\"\nWhen they both looked at each other   _  , the man said suddenly \"You're not Jimmy Wells. Twenty years is a long time,   _   not long enough to change a man's   _  .\" \"It sometimes changes a good man into a   _   one,\" said the tall man. \"You are under   _   now. Well, here is a note from your friend.\" His hand was steady when he began to read, but it   _   a little by the time he had finished. It reads: \"Bob: I was at the appointed place   on time  . When you lighted your cigar I saw it was the face of the man   _   by Chicago police.   _   I couldn't catch myself, so I went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job.\"",
