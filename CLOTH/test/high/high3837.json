    "article": "Rebuilding a broken friendship can be difficult. The   _  may not be easy to get over,\nbut you should try. Be the first to talk to your friend. If it wasn't your\nfault, then it should be easy to  _  your friend. Tell\nher that her friendship is more  _  to you than\nany silly misunderstanding. Be generous, and she will accept your apology.\nNever return to this painful  _  unless she brings it\nup.\nIf the fault was yours, tell her so and   _  that you should never have said what you said or done what you did.\nDon't send her an email or  _  her. You have to be\nbrave and apologize to her in person. If you're lucky, she might  _  it at once; otherwise, you will have to give her  _  to\nrecover. Get your shared friends to help if your first attempt has been  _  . But don't give up. Prove to your friend that she's worth fighting for and\nthat you're  _  to show how sorry you are by\nbeing mature and  _  until she's ready to forgive\nyou.\nA friendship can be broken in a minute due to   _  talk or jealousy. A true friendship however\nis worth mending but take it  _  , step by step. Talk\nto her about the good times you had and the bad times when you helped each\nother. Tell her how  _  it would be for you to\nlose someone you value and respect so much. Show her that your broken\nfriendship must be mended because you cannot  _  to\nkeep it broken forever.",
