    "article": "The Town of Pressure and the Town of Pleasure were neighbors but had nothing in common. Residents built walls to  keep out  influence from the other town. In Pressure,  _  struggled to be the very best. When women gave birth, they would  _  to have the baby with the loudest cry. There was violent competition in every aspect of life. Because  _  was the index of success, people were  _  busy making money, with  no time  for relaxation. Some young people couldn't bear the intensity and resorted to drink or drugs to escape.  _  , over in Pleasure, the motto was \"As long as you like it, do it.\" People grew up without  _  and  _  do anything they liked. Children played computer games day and night. At school, teachers didn't  _  whether students showed up or not. Workers might sit around the office  all day long  sipping coffee and doing nothing.  Thanks to  the lack of regulations, nobody worried about losing their jobs. It was  _  that mattered. No one had the  _  thought of moving forward, either for themselves or for the town. The computers they used were  the old  models from Pressure. Some of the young were addicted to  _  because of the meaninglessness of their lives. Then, people in the two towns began asking themselves, \"What is  _  for?\" But, just before life in the two towns completely  _  , there came a saint - Mr. Reason. He went from door to door, talking with people and giving advice. People in Pressure learnt to be  _  with what they had, while people in Pleasure began to make plans. They  pulled down  the walls between them and built a road to connect the two. The towns' people came to realize the truth--there is no space between Pressure and Pleasure if they don't go to extremes.",
