The water was so   _  , he filled his leather canteen  so he could bring some back to a tribal elder who had been his   _  .\nAfter a four-day journey he   _   the water to the old man who took a deep drink and   _  his student lavishly  for the water he offered. The young man returned to his village with a   _  heart.\nLater, the teacher let another student taste the water. He spat it out, saying it was awful. It   _   had become stale because of the old leather  _  \nThe student   _   his teacher: \"Master, the water was foul . Why did you pretend to like it?\"\nThe teacher replied, \"You only tasted the water. I tasted the   _  . The water was simply the container for a (n)   _  of loving-kindness and nothing could be sweeter.\"\nI think we understand this lesson best when young children give   _  innocent gifts of love.   Whether  it's a tray or a bracelet, the natural and proper   _   is appreciation and expressed   _  thankfulness because we love the   _  within the gift.\n  _  doesn't always come naturally,   _   most children and many adults   _  only the thing given rather than the feeling in it. We should remind ourselves and teach our children about the  _  and purity of feelings and expressions of gratitude. After all, gifts from the heart are really gifts of the heart.",
