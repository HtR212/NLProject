For example, Steve taught me to face the   _   of my behavior. Once when I returned in   _   from a Saturday baseball game, it was Steve who   _   the time to ask me what happened. When I   _   that my baseball had flown through Mrs Holt's basement window,   _   the glass with a crash, Steve encouraged me to   _   to her. After all, I   _   not have played in the path between buildings.   _   my knees shocked as I explained, I   _   to pay for the window if she would return my ball.\nI also learned from Steve that   _   property is a sacred thing. After I found a silver pen in my fifthgrade classroom, I wanted to   _   it, but Steve explained that it might be important to   someone   else in spite of the fact that it had little value. He reminded me of   what   I'd hate to lose the small dog my father gave me. I returned the pen to my teacher, Mrs. David.\nYet of all the   _   Steve gave me, his respect for   _   is the most vivid in my mind. When I was twelve, I killed an old brown sparrow in the park with a BB gun.   _   with my accuracy, I screamed to Steve to come from the house to have a look. I shall never forget the   _   he stood for a long moment and stared at the bird. \"Did it   _   you first, Mark?\" he asked. I didn't know what to answer. I really felt terrible then, but that moment   _   out as the most important lesson my brother taught me.",
