    "article": "Growing up in a military family, I moved a lot. I mostly went to   _   with other kids whose parents were also in the military. But when my dad   _   from the Marines after twenty years of service, I found myself   _   a civilian school with twelve-year-olds who shared no similar life experience with me.\nI was a stranger in a strange land. Everyone in my class had grown up together, and they had no room to   _   for a newcomer. I wore different clothes, had different thoughts, and spoke with an accent. I   _   for the first few weeks of school. I had no friends, no activities, and no   _   of a bright future. To deal with it all, I began   _   in my diary every day---stories of adventure, of old friends, of feelings that I could not speak. I wrote as if my life depended on it, as if the very next breath I took could not happen   _   I wrote down words.\nOne day, my teacher, Mrs. Bush, came to me and asked why I always sat there writing instead of playing with others. I told her I enjoyed writing and   _   writing to playing. She smiled at me and walked away. About three weeks later, Mrs. Bush gave us a writing assignment. I was   _   that I could now participate in something I knew I excelled in.\nThat night I worked and worked on the essay. I wrote with great   _  . It was my one chance to feel important and   _   by the class.\nA few days after we handed in our assignments, Mrs. Bush called me up to the   _   of the classroom. I stood before thirty pairs of eyes looking at me, and I got   _  . Was I in trouble? Did I do something wrong?\nThen Mrs. Bush told the class how much she   _   all the work that went into the essay and everyone had done a great job. But, she said, one student stood   _   as an excellent writer, one with imagination, creativity, and word mastery. That student was me!\nThe class clapped politely and Mrs. Bush handed me my paper, with the following   _   on it: \"Malinda, you are an excellent writer. You fill your paper with the breathings of your heart. Please keep on writing and share your   _   of writing with the world. I am proud of you and glad you are in my class.\"\nMrs. Bush helped me feel a sense of   _  , a place of purpose, and a way to survive a transition in life. She helped me gain   _   in myself that stayed with me beyond sixth grade.",
