What did you write?\" The man said, \"I just wrote the  _  .I said what you said but in a different way.\"\nWhat he had written was: \"Today is a beautiful day but I  _  see it.\"\nDo you think the previous sign and the new one were  _  the same thing? Of course both signs  _  people that the boy was blind.  _  , the first sign simply told people to help by putting some money in the hat because of his blindness.The second sign told people that they were  _  enough and able to enjoy the  _  of the day , which the boy couldn't.\nThere are at least two  _  we can learn from this simple story.\nThe first is : Be  _  for what you have.Someone else has  _  . Help where you can.\nThe second is : Be creative. Think  _  There is always a better way.",
