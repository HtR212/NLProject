    "article": "It was pouring outside. We all stood there  _  , some patiently , others annoyed  because  nature messed up their hurried day . I got lost in the sound and sight of the heavens  _  away the dirt and dust of the world. \"Mom, let's run through the rain,\" a girl's voice  _  me. \"No, honey. We'll wait until it  _  down a bit,\" Mom replied. The young girl waited about another minute and  _  : \"Mom, let's run through the rain.\" \"We'll get wet if we do,\" Mom said. \"No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning,\" the young girl said as she  _  her Mom's arm. \"This morning?  _  did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?\" \"Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said,\" If God can get us through this, he can get us through  anything  .\" The entire crowd turned  _  . Mom paused and thought for a moment about  _  she would say. Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being  _  . But then we heard, \"Honey, you are  _  . Let's run through the rain. If we get wet, maybe we just need washing,\" Mom said. Then  _  they ran. We all stood  _  , smiling and laughing as they ran past the cars. Yes, they got wet. But they were  _  by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the  _  to their cars. Circumstances or people can take away your material possessions, and they can even take away your  _  . But no one can ever take away your precious  _  . So, don't forget to make time and take the  _  to make memories every day! I hope you still take the time to run through the rain.",
