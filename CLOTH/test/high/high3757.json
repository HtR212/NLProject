    "article": "Towards the end of the baseball game, a controversial call was given. At full speed Paul Harvey slid and, thinking he had just  _  a game-changing run, he stood up only to face the words, \"You're  _  !\" Angry, he threw off his helmet and ran over to explain to the  _  why the call was wrong. Before his  _  really got out of control, someone pulled him away, and he walked to the bench---  _  . Long after the coaches, players, and fans had gone home, he realized the impact of his  _  . Like most of us do when we are faced with the  _  of our actions, he could have just let it go, reasoning, \"Everybody  _  it.\" However, in the silence of his heart, he knew that just  _  everyone else does it, that doesn't make it all right. And so, long after his friends had gone home, he  _  that coach back up to the school--not to  _  his car. No, the boy tracked this man down so he could tell him face to face, \"I'm sorry, Sir. It was all my  _  .\" It takes true courage to stand up to face the  _  we all make and say, \"I was wrong. I'm sorry.\" What makes this  _  unique is that it wasn't meant for the world to  _  , it was meant simply as a way to stay  _  to his own heart. The truth is at one time or another we have all been this boy ---  _  out in anger, saying hurtful things, and feeling  _  for doing so. But the real test comes later when we are  _  with the choice to say \"sorry\" or to walk away thinking, \"Ah, they'll get over it.\" Maybe the \"they\" is a customer, a friend, or a child. Whoever it is, don't pass up the opportunity to get right with your own heart. The time for apology is now! Courage is a  _  of the heart.",
