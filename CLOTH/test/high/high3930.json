    "article": "Signs can sometimes be seen at the entrance of a house, expressing that a tramp has passed. This special sign-language is frequently   employed  by tramps to inform their  _  whether\nthe host of a certain house is friendly or unfriendly, and to  _  them the trouble of making unnecessary calls.\n    Quite    by chance  one day, I came across a real tramp. He\nwas such a rare sight these days that I stood some distance away and watched\nhim. He was dressed just as a tramp should be  _  , old\nworn trousers, and a jacket many sizes too big for him. On his head there was a\nbattered old hat and his boots were so old and worn; they were almost coming\ninto  pieces  . But the man himself looked cheerful as if he\nhad not a  _  in the world. He rubbed his nose\nwith his forefinger,  _  a funny turn, laid a\nsmall parcel by the front gate, and began  _  a\nsign made by a former caller. Although the sign was meaningless to me, it must\nhave been  _  , for the tramp's face lit up with  _  . He entered the front gate confidently and rang the bell. When the door\nopened, I saw him  raise  his hat but couldn't hear\nhis words. The  _  was very short indeed, for no sooner\nhad he spoken a few words than the door closed fiercely in his face. I\nfelt  _  for him as he walked  _  out\nof the house, But just as quickly, his face lit up again and he moved quickly\ntowards the gate. There he stopped, looked at the sign, and  _  his head seriously as if he had made a bad mistake.  _  deeply\ninto his pockets, he produced a piece of chalk, rubbed out the  _  sign and made a new one in its place. He stared at it for a moment\nsmiling to himself, then gathered his  _  , pushed back\nhis hat and began walking towards the next house at an unhurried  _  , whistling as he went along.",
