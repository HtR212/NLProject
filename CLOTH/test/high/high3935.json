    "article": "It was a warm sunny Saturday afternoon some fifteen years ago. I   _  to\ntake  my daughter to the local playground. As soon as we got there, my\ndaughter headed for the  _  and asked for a push.\nAs I was helping my daughter to go higher and higher, I noticed another little\ngirl trying  in vain  to get her own swing going. Her\nelderly grandmother was sitting quietly on a nearby bench and  _  at me.\nI walked over to the little girl and   _  if she could use a push, too. She\nsmiled and said \"Yes!\" I soon had her  _  flying\ntowards the clouds while she laughed  _  . For\nthe next two hours I found myself  _  swings and\nplaying games with my daughter and the little girl. By the time we headed home,\nI was  _  worn out, but my spirits were still\nflying higher than those swings.\nTwo years later after a long day's work I went to   pick up  my kids from the local\ngrade school.  _  , I stood in the parents'\nwaiting area  _  for my children.  _  , I felt two tiny arms around my stomach. I looked down and there was\nthe little girl from the  _  smiling up at me.\nShe gave me one more big  _  before heading off\nto catch her school bus.  _  I watched her back,\nI didn't feel quite so tired anymore and my   _  were once again rising in the Heavens.\nIn this life,every single bit of love we share    _  its way back to us again. It may take seconds or it may take years.\nThe law of love,  _  , is never broken. The love\nwe share, the kindness we give and the  _  we\ncreate will always come back to bless us.",
