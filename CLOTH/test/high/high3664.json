    "article": "My husband and I insisted that our children were old enough to clean their rooms and make their beds. But they thought  _  . My complaints, even self-justified  _  , were always landing on  _  ears. Very often a whole hour's scolding would end with their  _  into tears. I felt very frustrated. I realized I needed to  _  my method of \"mothering\". One day when they were at school, I spent some time tidying their rooms. On their desks, in plain  _  , I left the cards: \"Dear Bill(the other card was  _  to Sarah), your room was messy this morning and I'm sure you like it clean. Love, the Room Fairy.\"  _  arriving back, the children were  more than  excited to receive the little note from the Room Fairy. The next day, their rooms were fairly tidy. Sure enough, there was another note from the Room Fairy  _  for them, thanking them for their nice \"gift\" of a clean room and  _  asking them to play a certain violin  _  . Each day, thank-you notes would be written differently to keep the ideas  _  . Sometimes the Room Fairy would propose a little  _  : \"If you can finish your homework and go over your lessons before dinner, I'd like to watch a particular television program with you tonight.\" Sometimes some colored markers or other little items would be left in  _  of well-done jobs the day  _  .  Actually  I can't remember how long \"the Room Fairy\" continued leaving her love notes. When they were age appropriate, we used various versions of Post-Its . The bathroom mirror became the  _  centre of our home. Appointments, notices about visiting relatives, lesson schedules, and changes in plans could be  _  . We all benefited from and  _  the idea of sharing reminders and daily details of life through notes. I believe the true advantage of the Room Fairy notes survives in our frequent and enjoyable communication.",
