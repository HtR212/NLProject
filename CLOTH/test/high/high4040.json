    "article": "We had moved from Cairo to Illinois, away from my grandmother when I was eight years old. I  _  her terribly. I was told I was her favorite  _  ; she was my favorite \"Granny.\"\nMy heart  _  for a long time after we went away. Mother must have noticed I wanted to see her,  _  she would take my  _  and me back to visit my Granny sometimes. I know Granny loved us.  _  it was something you could feel with your  _  . She didn't live in a fancy  house or have  _  things, but I never cared.\nAlthough she didn't have much,  _  did we, she did something for my brother Tommie and me. I will always remember she saved her  _  in a glass jar, which had  belonged to  her since she was married. I am sure Granny could have  _  those pennies herself but she saved them to  _  us when we came to visit. Because I was the older, I was  in charge of  dividing  the pennies  _  between my brother and me.\n\"One for you, one for me,\" I would  _  the words until the jar was empty. I don't remember how much we collected on our  _  and the amount  wasn't important at all. It was the idea that she remembered us and cared about us  _  moved me. Those  _  of my childhood still give me warm feelings when I'm sad. I often wonder if I found a penny  _  on the ground somewhere, could it possibly be Granny tossing  me pennies from heaven?",
