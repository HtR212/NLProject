Though Michael was the  _  of the class when he entered high school, his  _  continued to encourage him, but also made it very clear that he did not have to play  _  if he didn't want to. However, Michael loved football and was  _  to try his best at every practice. All through high school, he never  _  a practice or a game, but remained a bench warmer all four years. His  _  father was always in the stands, with words of  _  for him. It was the end of the football season, and as Michael ran slowly onto the practice field shortly  _  the big final game, the coach met him with a telegram. Michael  went through  the telegram and became deathly silent--his father died that morning, and the sad man left for  _  immediately. In the third quarter, when the team was ten points  _  , a silent young man eagerly  _  onto the sidelines. The coach and his players were shocked to see their team-mate back so  _  . \"Coach, please let me  _  . I have to play today,\" said Michael. Feeling sorry for him, the coach  _  .
