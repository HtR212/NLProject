The fire had   taken away  all those things with my memories.\nI have never known my mother to be   _  . In fact, my whole family has always been   _  . But when picking up my ashen   clothing on this cold winter morning, she moved with emptiness. The   _   was so heavy to us.\nDays passed and the situation didn't become   _  . After moving to the temporary house, my father told me dealing with this would cost   _   money. It brought about a wave of   _   and life became a struggle.\n\"Hey, Tony,\" a classmate came up to me at lunchtime with a box in her hands.   _  , all my classmates stood up. \"Tony, we know what 51 _  a few days ago.
