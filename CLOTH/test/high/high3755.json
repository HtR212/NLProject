They feared the awful  _  that spread across the Atlantic, damaging the buildings and crops.  _  the farmer interviewed applicants for the job, he received many  _  .\nFinally, a short, thin man, well past middle age,  _  the farmer.\" Are you a good farmhand?\" the farmer asked him.\n\"Well, I can  _  when the wind blows,\" answered the little man.\nAlthough  _  by this answer, the farmer,  _  for help, hired him. The little man worked well around the  _  , busy from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt  _  with the man's work. then one night the wind howled loudly in from offshore. Jumping out of bed, the farmer took a lantern and  _  next door the hired hand's sleeping room. He shook the little man and  _  , \"Get up! A storm is coming! Tie things down  _  they are blown away! The little man rolled over in bed and said  _  , \"No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows\"  _  by the answer, the farmer was tempted to fire him on the spot.  instead  , he hurried outside to prepared for the storm.
