When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand,the professor said,\"If you have  _  ,all the nicelooking expensive cups have been  taken up  ,leaving behind the plain and  _  ones.Of course,  _  it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves,that is the  _  of your problems and stress.\" \"It is sure that the cup itself  _  no quality to the coffee.  In most cases  it is just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we  _  .\" \"What all of you really want is coffee,not the cup,but you went  _  for the best cups.And then you began  _  each other's cups.\" \"Now consider this:Life is the coffee;the jobs,  _  and position in society are the cups.They are just tools to  _  and contain life,and the type of cup we have does not define,nor  _  the quality of life we live.Sometimes,by concentrating only on the cup,we  _  to enjoy the coffee.Value the coffee,not the cups!\" Don't let the cups  _  you.Enjoy the coffee instead.",
