    "article": "The Hand Thanksgiving Day was near. The first grade teacher gave her class fun work to draw a picture of  _  for which they were thankful. Most of the class might be  _  to be economically poor, but still many would  _  a big holiday dinner with turkeys and other traditional goodies of the season. These, the teacher thought, would be the  _  of most of her students' art. And they really were. But Douglas made a  _  kind of picture, for Douglas was a different kind of boy. He was the teacher's true child of pity and love,  _  and unhappy. As other children played at break, Douglas was likely to stand close by her side. One could only guess the pain Douglas felt  _  those sad eyes. Yes, his picture was different. When he was  _  to draw a picture of something for which he was thankful, he drew a  _  ---nothing else. Just an empty hand. His picture brought out the heated  _  of his classmates. Whose hand could it be? One child guessed it was the hand of a farmer because farmers  _  turkeys. Another suggested a police officer's because the police protect and  care for  people. And so the discussion went --- until the teacher  _  forgot the young artist.  _  the children had gone on to do other work, she  turned to  Douglas' desk, bent down, and asked him whose hand it was. The little boy looked away and said in a very low voice, \"It's yours, teacher.\" She recalled the  _  when she had taken his hand and walked with him here and there and how  _  she had said, \"Take your hand, Douglas, and we'll go outside.\" or \"Let me show you how to hold your pencil.\" or \"Let's do this together.\" Douglas was most  _  for his teacher's hand. Brushing aside tears, she went on with her work. In fact, people  _  not always say \"Thanks\". But they would remember the hand that  reached out  .",
