There was only a 41 _  space between the line of people and the tables, which she   _   to drive along. She drove over my foot and didn't   look back   saying nothing at all.\nI got annoyed and expected she would have   _  , but then I just decided to 45 _  it and got down to selecting which pastry   to go with my coffee. The lady and I ended up sitting at adjacent   tables. She was on the end of a row so that she could park her 46 _ . After about half an hour, when she had 47 _  her coffee, she got up and back onto her scooter. It 48 _  start. She tried to turn the key several times 49 _  she telephoned the place she purchased it from.\nAn engineer   turned up   within 5 minutes. The place must have been local. I couldn't   _   overhearing their conversation, and it turned out she had just   _   the scooter that morning. This was her very first outing in it. She felt really   _   about driving it.   _  , she wasn't used to its speed, nor its 55 _ , and this combination made it quite 56 _  to drive it through narrow gaps.\nSuddenly, I felt 57 _  for the lady. It really didn't 58 _  me at all that she'd driven over my foot. I had made an assumption, 59 _ , that a person doing that should apologize.\nNext time you're about to   _   someone, pause for a second and remind yourself that people have judged you without knowing what was going on in your mind or your life.",
