    "article": "Double Angels\nIt was Christmas Eve, and the stores were going to be closing pretty soon.I was trying to   _   my way through the crowds when a guy in a black coat came up to me , told me that he had lost his brown leather   _  and shoved his gray business card into my hand.\nPlease call me at the number on the card if you happen to find it,\" he said.I looked at him, shrugged my shoulders and   _  , \"Yeah, no problem.I'll do that.\"\nSuddenly, I noticed a flat, green box   _  under some wrapping paper.I opened it up to find an amazing   _  plate with a Nativity scene on it.There it was.I smiled  _  , gathered it up and headed  _   the cash register.As the cashier was ringing up my   _  , I reached into my pocket to get my money.  _  my pocket was empty!  I began to scramble around searching every pocket when I   _  I had left my wallet at home.\nSo I did the only thing I could think of at that moment: I ran outside the store and started to beg people for   _  .Some looked at me like I was crazy; others just  _  me.Finally, giving up, I slumped down on a cold bench feeling totally   _  .\nI reached down to tie my shoe when I spotted a   _   wallet lying next to the front leg of the bench.I wondered if it   _   be the wallet that the man in the black coat had lost.I opened it and read the name on the driver's license inside.Yep.It was his.Then my mouth dropped in awe   _   I discovered three hundred dollars inside.\nI never even questioned what I should do.I found a nearby pay phone and made a/an  _  call to the number on the gray business card.The man was so excited that he thanked me over and over .Then he opened up the wallet and   _   me four twenty-dollar bills, thanking me again and I hurried to get my mom a present before the mall closed.\nI bought the glass plate and started skating home,   _  that everything had worked out.I realized that I had been sort of a Christmas angel for the man who had lost his wallet, and that he had been the same for me when I'd   _   mine.Double angels!
