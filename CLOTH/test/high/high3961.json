    "article": "When sailors are allowed ashore after a long time at sea, they sometimes get drunk and cause trouble. For this reason, the navy   _   has its police in big ports. Whenever sailors cause trouble, the police come and   deal with   them.  \nOne day, the police in a big seaport received a telephone call   _   a bar in the town. The barman said that a big sailor had got drunk and   was breaking   the furniture in the bar. The officer in charge of the police guard that evening said that he would come immediately.  \nNow, officers who   had to go   and punish the sailors   heavily   drunk usually chose   the biggest   policeman they could find to go with them.   But   this particular officer did not do this.   _  , he chose the smallest and   _   man he could find to go to the bar with him and   seize   the sailor.  \nAnother officer who   happened to be   there was surprised when he saw the officer of the guard chose such a small man.   _   he said to him, \"Why   _   you take a big man with you? You have to fight the sailor who   is drunk  .\"  \n\"Yes, you are   _   right,\" answered the officer of the guard. \"That is exactly   _   I am taking this small man. If you see two policemen coming   _   you, and one is   much smaller than   the other, which one   _   you attack?\"",
