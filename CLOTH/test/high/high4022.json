    "article": "I went online to check if my pay was in my bank  _  . To my amazement I discovered that not only had I been paid, a  _  I'd never worked for had also paid me! I knew I'd have been beside myself if my own salary was not in my account, so I tried to get the money  _  to the right person. Easier said than  _  .\nThe bank couldn't help as it wasn't a bank  _  . The human resources department at the company that paid me was unable to help as I didn't have enough  _  . I rang the bank again.  _  , I had a sympathetic call operator who gave me a(n)  name  , so I again rang the company \"Daniel\" worked for.\nI expected the bank would  _  me to arrange to take the money from my account and repay Daniel. I heard  _  for a month and the money remained in my account when Daniel called,  _  he'd tried to get back his money but had been unsuccessful as neither the bank nor his company felt it was their  _  . He had rung to ask if I could speak to the bank, but after chatting for a few minutes we realized we could probably  _  this problem ourselves.\nWe decided I would take the money from my account and he would  _  it up from me. Due to my busy job I was unable to meet Daniel  _  but he left me a lovely bottle of wine  in exchange for  what was rightfully his. I never had any  _  of keeping Daniel's pay but red tape  made  _  difficult to do the right thing. It all came down to    _  people being able to do what a huge bank and a large company couldn't do----  _  a mistake has occurred and fix it.",
