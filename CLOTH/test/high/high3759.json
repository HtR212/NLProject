    "article": "My ears are recently full of joyous remarks from my friends such as, \"Oh, Beckham is so handsome, so cool, that I can't help falling in love with him!\" or \"What perfect skills he has!\" Yeah, I  _  to some degree, though I sometimes do want to  _  them how much they know about Beckham, apart from his  _  and how much they know about football apart from  _  goals. It seems funny that we are  _  for things, with which we are unfamiliar or about which we are  _  , but we all, my friends as well as I, consider this one of life's  _  . We need these pleasures to brighten up our lives. But that doesn't amount to craziness or nonsense. As an old saying goes: \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\" We  _  not judge anything from its appearance. We should all know, it is one's good  _  and great contribution that make one a star and unforgettable. Therefore we'd better say  _  about Beckham's good looks. If we close our eyes, falling in deep thought, we can find that the things that move us to be really happy or sad have a  _  meaning. If we don't go deeper and are just satisfied with  _  things, sooner or later we will find that we have not really gained anything because our first  _  has blinded and misled us, and we'll remain ignorant  _  we realize that and make some changes. It is believed that thinking and going deeper than before is a sign of great progress. If one day we are willing to go deeper into everything, no matter how much it pains us, we will finally prove how much we have  _  up, how much more sensible, mature, and intelligent we have become.",
