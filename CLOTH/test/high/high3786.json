    "article": "It was a warm March evening,and I'd just taken a seat on the bus that would take me home.It was nearly 6:00 PM,but the bus was not yet full and the driver gave no  _  that he intended to start the bus. A middle-aged woman took a seat opposite me . She was crying.Not speaking to anyone in particular,she  _  told her story. She had come to the city to visit her daughter.On the way to the terminal ,a thief had  _  one of her bags.It had contained half of the money she'd brought with her.The other half was hidden under her blouse, so she  _  still had some money left.The bus conductor,driver,and other passengers listened to her tale. At this time, an old man  in rags  got on the bus.He sat in the seat directly in front of the woman.After a few minutes, all seats were  _  .The driver started the engine.The bus conductor collected tickets and began asking us where we were  getting off  .When he came to the old man's seat,he became  _  and asked the old man whether he had any money.The old man  _  that he did not.He explained that he  had spent  all his money this morning when he'd accidentally got on the wrong bus and now he was trying to go home. Upon hearing this,the bus conductor  _  the old man to get off the bus.The old man was almost in tears as he begged the bus conductor to let him take that bus  _  he could get home before dark.The bus driver approached the old man,and repeated the conductor's  _  to get off the bus. \"Stop troubling him! Can't you see he's only trying to get home?\"she interrupted.\"He doesn't have any money!\"the driver shouted.\"Well, that's no  _  to throw him off the bus,\"she insisted.Then she said,\"How much is his fare?\"The bus conductor mumbled the amount.\"Fine.\"said the woman.She  _  inside her blouse, took out her  _  money,and handed the fare to the bus conductor.\"Here's his fare and mine.Just stop giving him a hard time.\" All eyes turned  _  the woman,who,just minutes before,had been crying over the money she'd lost.\"It's only money,\" she shrugged. By the time the bus pulled out of the terminal,she had given the old man some bread and a dollar.She rode the rest of the way home  _  a Mona Lisa smile of peace and grace,and the money she'd lost  _  was forgotten. On the road of life,the politeness and smiles of  _  can lighten our loads and lift our spirits.How much sweeter the journey when we make it a little smoother and richer for others !",
