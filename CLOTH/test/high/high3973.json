A few months later, the wife came to the husband with a proposal, \"I read in a magazine about how we can  _  our marriage. Each of us will write a list of the things that we find a bit  _  with the other. Then, we can talk about how we can  _  them together and make our lives happier together.\" The husband  _  . So each of them went to a(n)  _  room and thought about the things that annoyed them about the other for the rest of the day. The next morning, at the breakfast table, they decided that they would go over their  _  . \" I'll start,\" offered the wife. She  took out  her list. It had many items on it, enough to fill 3 pages. After the wife had read all three pages to her husband,  _  the husband seated, \"I don't have anything on my list. I think that you are perfect the  _  that you are. I don't want you to  _  anything for me.\" The wife, touched by his honesty by his depth of his love for her and his  _  of her, turned her head and wept.
