    "article": "One cool morning I was asked to go to several garage sales together with my mother.We finally  _  at a pleasant house in the woods.The elderly  _  told me that he and his wife were retired teachers.As we were searching, I heard the gentleman's wife say her  _  to someone, and I immediately  _  who she was.She looked at me and said, \"You're Susan Miller.\" I looked at her  _  , for it had been nearly thirty years  _  I had been in her class.\nMy mother immediately said sorry to her for any bad  _  that I might have done.She apologized again after learning that I wasn't the sweet little child.Mum thought that if this woman  _  me after so many years, I must have done something  _  .My teacher looked at my mother and  _  said, \"Oh, no, she was very good.\"\nMy teacher  _  that during the last week of school, I brought  her a plant from my mother's garden.It was a lamb's ear.She took us to her garden  _  she planted the lamb's ear.Over the years, it spread.As I looked down her driveway with lamb's ear  growing  on both sides, she said, \"Every day when I leave my house and drive up the driveway, I think of you.And when I come home, they  _  me and I think of you.\" Tears  came into  my eyes.There at her home was a piece of my life that she had raised.\nAt that moment, she taught me far more about  _  than I could imagine.We give away pieces of ourselves every day  _  thought.We seldom imagine the effects that we have on others' lives.That piece may grow and spread, becoming a  _  part of a life.In the end it is not the big things that matter,  _  the small things that make all the  _  in the world.",
