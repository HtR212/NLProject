It's a story of pizza and being   afraid of  of buying ice cream with a US $20 bill.\nI was going to Marblehead, Massachusetts, with my racing team on the highway and we were all   _  Luckily, we saw a rest area   _  . I had a brand-new US $ 20 bill, and I had   _   had that kind of cash before. Spending it on food   _  to me like throwing it away.\nWe all rushed into the pizza line.  _   I got a cheese pizza and drink. Halfway through the   _  , I realized I had not actually   _  any money to the cashier. I felt terrible. I just couldn't go back to the cashier and   pay for  my stolen pizza. I would feel embarrassed.\nI was so upset that I refused to give myself the  _  of an ice cream in fear that someone would say, \"Hey, Jeff, why don't you   _   the change from the pizza instead of that nice, new US $20 bill?\" I was not so proud of my   cash   now.\nFor the next two years, whenever I was   _  of the \"Pizza incident,\" I   _  my eyes and said to myself, \"Not gonna think about it, not gonna think about it...\"\nI think this   _   the saying, \"A coward   dies a thousand deaths, a hero dies   _  .\" I was a coward and have felt  _   about that incident at least a thousand times. If I had been a \"hero\" and gone   _  up to pay for the pizza, then I would have felt a little embarrassed about it only once, or maybe twice.",
