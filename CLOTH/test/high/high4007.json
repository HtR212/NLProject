    "article": "Terry Evanshen was one of Canadian football's greatest receivers. But his memories of his playing days were   _   lost after a car accident in 1988. \nThat accident seemed to have   _   effect on his body, but it cleaned all his memories. He didn't even   _   his own wife or children. What he   _   was not only his memories of people and events, but also his   _   to do the basic things. He was   _   to the level of a child. At the age of 44, Terry   _   his life all over again. He had to   _   how to think, how to speak, and even learn something as   _   as how to wash his face. \nBut for his family, what was really difficult was that Terry's brain could not understand any human   _  . He recalls what it was like to live   _   a sense of what love is: \"Not knowing what love meant, I wouldn't know how to show   _   reaction to others. What is right; what should I do?\"\nThough Terry had so many   _  , his family always supported him. Terry wouldn't give up, either. Finally, in 1992, his memory began to   pick up   quickly. Many things began to fly back to his   _  . But it still took him several more years to   _   his normal life. Today, more than 20 years after his playing days, Terry is a very popular   _  . He tells his story of perseverance   and courage in his speech called Seize Each Day. \"We're all in this game of   _   together,\" he said, \"we will get to the finish line one day. Seize today, because yesterday is   _   and is never coming back.\"\nIn 2005, Canada made a film on him, called The Man Who Lost Himself. It has been   _   many people since it was put on.",
