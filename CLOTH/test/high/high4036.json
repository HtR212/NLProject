    "article": "It was Mother's Day morning and I was doing some shopping at our local supermarket with my five-year-old son, Tenyson.\nAs we were leaving, we found that an elderly woman had fallen over at the  _  and had hit her head on the concrete. Her  _  was with her, but there was blood everywhere and the woman was embarrassed and clearly  in shock  . Walking  _  the scene, Tenyson became very upset about  _  had happened to the couple. He said to me, \"Mum, it's not much fun falling over in front of everyone.\"\nAt the front of the supermarket, a charity group had set up a  _  selling cooked sausages and flowers to  _  funds. Tenyson  _  that we should buy the lady a flower. \"It will make her feel  _  ,\" he said. I was  _  that he'd  come up with  such a sweet idea. So we went over to the flower seller and asked her  _  we could buy a flower for the lady to cheer her up. \"Just take it,\" she  _  . \"I can't take your money for such a wonderful gesture.\"\n  _  we walked up to her, my son became frightened by all the blood and medical equipment. He said he was just too  _  to go up to her.  _  , I gave the flower to the woman's husband and told him, \"My son was very upset for your wife and wanted to give her this flower to make her feel better.\"\n  _  that, the old man started crying and said, \"Thank you so much, you have a wonderful son. Happy Mother's Day to you.\"\nThe man then bent down and gave his wife the flower,  _  her who it was from.  _  badly hurt and shaken, the old lady looked  _  at Tenyson with love in her eyes and gave him a little smile.",
