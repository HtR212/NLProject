I went to the spot where I used to take my kids-when I still had kids. Now they had  grown up  and were leaving. I was sitting alone in my car when I saw a man in his seventies, whose problem appeared bigger than mine. He stood near the edge of the road,  _  a kite spindle in his hands. Apparently, lost in thought, he stared skyward. I  _  my neck to see how successful he had been in  _  the clouds. Following his string with my eyes, I almost lost  _  0f the other end. Finally, the kite rested on what seemed to be the highest branch of the  _  tree in the park. Obviously, that was his grandson's kite! The kite was a replica of a beautiful bald eagle, and its wings spread  _  0pen. Grandpa had only one  _  to his problem: cut the string. \"You wanted it to fly as high as it could. Bill. didn't you?\" \"Yes, Grandpa,  _  wanted to keep it forever. \" \"There just comes a time when the only thing you can do is to cut the string and let it go. Perhaps by doing that, when it flies very high like real eagles do, it will come back to us. \" Grandpa said. I  _  how the old man cut the string to let fly the kite. As the two walked away, looked to the  _  . There I saw my answer, too. Today I have to cut the final strings that kept my two boys  _  my reach. Though I want to keep them forever, I have taught them to fly like an eagle. Maybe by doing this, when it's time to soar like real eagles do. one day they would come back to me.",
