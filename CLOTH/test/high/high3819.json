At 12 inches long and  _  only one pound and nine ounces, she was a premature baby.\nBut the doctor's soft words dropped like  _  . \"I don't think she's going to make it\" he said. \"There's only a 10-percent  _   she will pull through the night, and even then, if by some chance she does make it, her future could be a very   _  one.\"\nDavid and Diana listened as the doctor  _   the serious problems the newly--born baby, Anna, would   _  face if she survived. She would never walk; she would never   _  ; she would probably be blind; and so on.\n\"No! No!\" was all Diana could   _  . She and David, with their 5-year-old son Dusfin, had long   dreamed of  the day they would have a daughter to become a  _  of four. Now, within a matter of hours, that dream was slipping away. But Diana insisted, \"I don't care what the doctors say! One day she will be coming home with us!\"\nCertainly, there was 51 never  a moment when Anna suddenly grew  _  . But as the weeks went by, she did   _  gain an ounce of weight here and an ounce of   _   there. At last, when Anna turned two months old, her parents were able to  _   her in their arms for the very first time though  _  continued to gently but coldly   _  that her chances of surviving, much less living any kind of normal life, were next to zero.\nFinally, Anna went home from the hospital, just as her mother had   _   . Today, five years later, Anna is a little but lively young girl with bright gray eyes59 and                  <IMG>  a strong interest for life. She shows no   _  of any mental or physical injuries. Simply, she is everything a little girl can be.",
