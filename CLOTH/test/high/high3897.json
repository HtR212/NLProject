    "article": "Years ago, if a teenager had some problems in his life, he might go home and write in his diary; now, a teenager with  the same  problems might go onto the Internet and write about them in a blog . In many ways, a diary and a blog are very  _  . But what makes bolgging different from writing in a(n)  _  diary? The biggest difference is that a blog is much more  _  than a diary. Usually, a teenager treats his diary like a book full of  _  that he does not want to  _  with others. It's interesting that someone who writes in a blog  instead of  a diary will probably write nearly the same information. I have a little sister, and sometimes I go online to read her  _  . She writes about things like waking up early for swimming practice and not studying enough for her chemistry test.  _  I was her age, I wrote about the same things, but  _  in my dairy. Then, after I had finished writing, I would hide my diary in a secret place because I was  _  that my sister might read it. The biggest  _  with blogging is that anyone can read what you write. If I was angry with a friend during high school and wrote something  _  about him in my diary, he would never know.  _  , if my sister ever wrote something bad about a friend, that friend might  _  her blog and get angry. There are also  _  to blogging, of course. If I was feeling sad one day and wrote in my diary, \" Nobody cares about me\", because no one would  _  about it. However, if my sister wrote the same sentence in her blog, her best friends would quickly  _  and tell her how much they  _  her. Blogs help people  _  in contact with their friends and know what the people around them are doing.",
