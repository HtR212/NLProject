I   _  was a\ntwelve -year old black boy, attended a   _  where everyone was white.\n   Soon after we   _  we realized that our new neighbors had a deep- rooted prejudice against   _   people. Like the grown-ups, some of the   _   were very   _   . They\n  _  stones at me and spat   on my bike seat. I felt ashamed of   being different   ----a  person who was looked down upon. However, different from other   _  people, our history teacher Miss Bean believed that black people were   equal  . So things began to change when I walked into her   _  .On the morning after having read our first assignment  ,she asked me the first question. My   _  was not an excellent one, but it did prove that I had read the assignment. Later in the hour, when one of my classmates had given a   _  answer, Miss Bean asked me to get it right, and my correction proved me to be a   _   person.   Therefore  , the teacher began to help me gain self-respect.",
