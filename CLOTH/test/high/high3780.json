Just as we had   _  , my good friends and I were in the   _   class, including Derek, a boy  I have   _    for a long time. He was nice to everyone and always brought excitement to us.\nFor the first few months, Derek   _   his Maple Leaf jersey   to school almost every day, because that was his   _   National Hockey League (NHL) team uniform. He spent all of fall and most of winter   _   soccer with other guys, guarding the net   _   in a big snowstorm. Then, a few weeks before school ended for the Christmas holiday, Derek   _   coming to school. I didn't think much of it and just kept   _   preparing for final exams.\nOn December 19, 2013, our class was   _   because it was the second-to-last day of school before vacation. Then as we   settled down   into craft making, game-playing and chatting mode, our English teacher walked into the   _  . Her nose was bright red, as if she had been   _  . And then the school principal  walked in. She was   _   by a few people carrying Derek's belongings. She moved to the front of the class and we   _   fell silent, wondering what could have   _  . \"I have some bad news about Derek,\" said the principal with great   _  . Suddenly, my feeling told me that Derek wasn't well, but I hoped I was wrong. \"Last night, Derek died. He was a(n)   _   boy, for he saved a little girl from a rushing car, for which Derek was in a   _   condition. After a few weeks, he left us for ever.\"\nA silence fell on the class. No one   _  . But for a second, everyone was crying. Derek, we could miss you.",
