Then we get frustrated because our children are not old enough, and that  _  will be well when they are older. Then we are frustrated  _  they reach adolescence and we must deal with them. Surely we'll be  _  when they grow out of the teen years. We tell ourselves our  _  will be better when our spouse gets his/her act together, when we have a nicer car, when we can take a  _  , when we finally retire. The truth is that there is no better time to be happy than  right now  .If not, then when? Your life will always be full of challenges. It is better to admit as much and to decide to be happy  in spite of  it all. For the longest time, it seemed that life was about to start--real life. But there were always some obstacles along the way, an ordeal to  get through  , some work to be finished, some time to be given, a bill to be  _  .Then life would start. It finally dawned on me that those  _  were part of life. Little by little, that point of  _  also helped me see that there isn't any road to happiness. Happiness is the road. So, enjoy every moment. And bear in mind that  _  waits for no one.
