    "article": "After seating myself in my room and turning on my computer, I noticed a Post-it note stuck to my monitor . It read, \"Don't  turn on  your computer. You stayed up until midnight doing your homework last night.--Mom.\" I  _  the note into the wastebasket. \"Why do they  _  ?\" I thought. \"They're never here anyway.\" Right after high school started, I almost  _  contact with my parents. With all their business  _  , they asked the neighbors to watch over me. Of course, the neighbors didn't do such a(n)  _  job, as they had kids of their own to worry about. The only means of  _  between me and my parents was through Post-it notes. After spending about eight hours away from home, I usually came home to find the house  _  empty. It made me sad. I would come home from school to be welcomed by  _  , to talk to no one and to be watched over by my neighbors. That was when I started  _  more clubs and staying after school more often  _  I didn't have to feel so lonely. Luckily, at school, my friends were there  _  me. They were all there to give me a  _  or talk with me when I wanted to talk. I felt  _  when I was at school. Yet, something was still  _  -- my parents. Now I realize that nobody can  take the place of  my parents. I wish that they would be there at home,  waiting for  me to come back from school. There are  too many  things my parents don't know about me. I wish that they actually had a(n)  _  to understand me. I want them to understand that they're my parents and I'm their kid and I  _  them.",
