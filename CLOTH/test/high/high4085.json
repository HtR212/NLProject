    "article": "Cheerful Charlie was a very special boy. When he was still in his mother's tummy  , she had had an accident, which   _  that Charlie couldn't walk. But that had never been a(n)  _  for him; he had always been happy. When he became older, they had\nstarted calling him Cheerful Charlie because of his joyful and  _  nature. He really brightened everything up for those around him.\nThere wasn't a postman, or a taxi driver who wasn't   _  to see Charlie. \"Cheer up, Mr. Postman, that way you'll  _  more letters today!\" he would say, or \"That was great, Mr. Taxi\nDriver. You  _  that thing better than anyone\nelse.\" He also had great ideas and  _  for\neverything; and he shared them so  _  that, just\nabout every day in that town, someone did a great job, or  _  something new, thanks to Charlie's ideas.\n       One day, though, he came up against a real   _  . A young\nboy came to town on his holidays. He was known as Waterworks and was a real crybaby.\nNo matter what Charlie said to him, Waterworks would always find some  _  to be sad: \"I don't have many sweets...my parents didn't buy me that\ntoy...\" Everything seemed so bad to him. But Cheerful Charlie wasn't going to be  let down  , and he kept spending more time with Waterworks,  _  trying\nto cheer him up, just as he did with everyone.\n       Then, one day, when they were together in the street, someone   _  a pie from a window above by chance, and it landed  _  on Charlie's head. He got such a fright that he couldn't even move\nhis lips. He was speechless, and  _  Waterworks\nwas just about to cry, he  _  Charlie's happy\nwords so much that he finally said, \"Wow, Charlie, that's a nice clown mask   you just   put on  !\"\n       On saying those words, Waterworks felt so   _  that\nhe finally understood why Charlie was always so happy and cheerful. He realized\nthat he was so used to Charlie's enthusiasm that he couldn't help but see the\nfun  _  of everything.",
