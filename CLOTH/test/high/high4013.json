    "article": "As of Monday, Amy Carrickhoff's video \"Spoiled deer getting her bottle\" was viewed more than 792,000 times and shared 9,600 times. In this heartwarming video, Carrickhoff stands outside her house in Oakridge, North Carolina,  _  for a deer she has named \"Little Girl.\" The deer comes out of the  _  and jumps on her. It hurries up the driveway and  _  Carrickhoff into the house, where it then sucks down a baby bottle of goat's milk. When the  _  is gone, Carrickhoff wipes its mouth with a tissue. While some animal lovers were touched by the obvious  _  Carrickhoff had with the deer, others felt she wasn't doing the deer any  _  . They said she was allowing the deer to get too  _  around humans and it could have been hit by a car, been shot by a hunter, or hurt someone. \"You just gave this animal a death  _  -- you also have put all your neighbors and their children at  _  of being attacked when this deer matures, and when it doesn't get  _  , it attacks someone,\" one reader wrote. Carrickhoff's comment was that if she had known the video would get so many  _  she would have changed out of her gym clothes. As for the deer,  _  , the update isn't a happy one. Little Girl continued coming back for bottles until around January 2011, when it moved onto  _  deer food, Carrickhoff said. \"She walked off into the woods and we never saw her again,\" she said. \"We  _  those woods ... we never found anything.\" Looking back, Carrickhoff said getting to know the deer was a special  _  that she wouldn't regret. Friends had brought Little Girl to Carrickhoff's home because the woods in their backyard were protected, and the deer would be  _  from hunters. School children loved visiting the gentle creature, who would  _  them with its soft tongue and didn't mind being  _  . Carrickhoff is confident that she didn't over-domesticate the animal. Even when Little Girl was bottle-fed, she lived in the woods and did \"deer things\", Carrickhoff's daughter said. The deer gave birth to a  _  of its own the following June, and toward the end, it wouldn't come when it was called. It was becoming  _  again. She and her husband got so attached to Little Girl that they don't ever want to take care of another animal. \"I just watch the videos and she kind of lives on,\" she said.",
