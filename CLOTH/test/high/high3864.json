    "article": "I wished I had known earlier the fact that I was a low achiever because there was a reason beyond my control. Then I  _  have worked so hard in my late twenties and early thirties. But I just didn't  _  that. I was writing and writing. I was working for no other reason than to hear people praise me.\nMost people who  go through  university read at least twice as fast as I do. I can never tell my left  _  my right. I avoid dialing a telephone if I can help it, because I sometimes have to try three times before getting the number  _  . I hear that recording \"The number you have reached is not  in service  \" more than any man on earth.\nDespite my  _  I view my dyslexia(difficulty in reading) as a gift, not a curse . Many dyslexics are good at right brain, namely abstract thought ,and that is  _  my king of creative writing is. I'm starting with  _  and coming up with something that didn't exist before. That's my strong point. I  _  my career to Ralph, Salisbury, my writing instructor at the university of Oregon, who looked past my misspellings and gave me  _  and hope. I just carried on and never looked  _  . I'm also very\"visual\" .This means nothing in school, but when I write books or scripts, I'm seeing everything in my imagination. I write  _  . I go like the wind and can  _  up to 15 pages a day. Writing is not the  _  . I have no problem downloading; it is inputting  _  things get messed up.\nThe real  _  I have for dyslexics is not that they have to  _  with messy input, but that they will quit on themselves before they finish school. Parents have to create victories whenever they can,  _  it is music, sports or the arts. You want your dyslexic child to be able to say, \"Yeah, reading is  _  . But I have these other things I can do.\"",
