One day, Mrs. Nanette O'Neill gave an arithmetic   _  to our class. When the papers were marked she discovered that twelve boys had made exactly the   _   mistakes throughout the test. \nThere is nothing really new about43 _ in exams. Perhaps that was why Mrs. O'Neill  _  even say a word about it. She only asked the twelve boys to  _  after class. I was one of the twelve. \nMrs. O'Neill asked  _   questions, and she didn't   _   us either. Instead, she wrote on the blackboard the   _  words by Thomas Macaulay. She then ordered us to  _   these words into our exercise-books one hundred times. \nI don't   _  about the other eleven boys. Speaking for  _  I can say :it was the most important single  _  of my life. Thirty years after being introduced to Macaulay's words, they  _  seem to me the best yardstick , because they give us a   _  to measure ourselves rather than others. \n  _  of us are asked to make  _  decisions about nations going to war or armies going to battle. But all of us are called upon daily to make a great many personal decisions.57 _ the wallet, found in the street, be put into a pocket  _     turned over to the policeman? Should the  _  change received at the store be forgotten or returned? Nobody will know except  _  . But you have to live with yourself, and it is always better to live with someone you respect.",
