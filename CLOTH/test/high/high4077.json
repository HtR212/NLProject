    "article": "The inhalation of asbestos particles is associated with a number of lung diseases, such as asbestosis and  _  cancer. Asbestosis is caused by the entry of asbestos particles into the wall of the alveoli, causing scarring which limits the functioning of the lungs. The lung  _  its elasticity and may change shape. The initial symptoms of asbestosis are a tightness in the chest and breathlessness. In its  _  stages, sufferers develop the barrel-shaped chests associated with emphysema, cyanosis, (where the skin takes a bluish  _  ) and club fingers. Lung cancer, the generic  _  for malignant tumors of the alveoli and bronchial tubes, has been shown to be directly  _  to the inhalation of asbestos particles. As in the case of asbestosis, there is generally a period of inactiveness which may  _  from 25 to 30 years after initial exposure, despite the  _  of further exposure. Research suggests that there is a direct correlation between the degree of exposure to asbestos  and  the incidence of lung cancer. Where exposure occurs, the level of risk is further  _  by cigarette smoking. Asbestos workers who smoke cigarettes have a 90% greater risk of catching lung cancer than workers who do not  _  . Exposure to blue asbestos has been shown to producemesothelioma, a rare cancer of the outer lining of the lung or pleura. In a normal population the incidence of mesothelioma is extremely  _  . Where epidemiological surveys have revealed a higher incidence of the disease, it is almost always related to  _  exposure.  _  changes in lung tissue caused by exposure to asbestos are pleural plaques and effusions. The former refer to a thickening of the lining of the chest wall,  whereas  the latter consists of a collection of fluid in the chest region outside the lungs. Pleural plaques commonly remain undiagnosed and generally have no detrimental effect on health.",
