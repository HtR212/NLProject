    "article": "So tired as I was, I bothered myself to open up my cafe shop on the cold morning. With many consumers streaming in, I knew another long business day began. And I had to serve far into the night. As I rushed among the tables, suddenly, a  _  asked if I could mind a child. I was quite  _  but I could tell the man was quite desperate . So I had to make a  _  with him that if he wanted his son to stay and wait for him, he had to  _  something in the shop. This was quite  _  for the man to do; I could  _  he was quite poor by the  _  he was dressed. It looked as if he had tried to come in his  _  clothes. But they still looked a bit old and worn out  as if  he had often worn them, just to make himself look best. Looking down I could see his  _  were also a bit shabby and the heels were in a terrible state. I thought he was going for a job interview. In the end he bought a small box of  _  for his little son and seated him down in the corner. I could tell the boy was feeling down and only could  _  with a bit of cheering up. Seeing that the kid sat there for quite a while, I was a bit  _  as the poor little kid was sitting  _  his own. People watched him and some kids even came over to pick on him. I was  _  to see one of them even knocked his cookies off the table. He quickly went and got them back without saying a word. I was hoping his father would  _  up and come back for his son's  _  . At closing time, the only person left was the little boy. After a while, the father finally came in with a tiresome look. I  _  he didn't get any job. As they were leaving, I offered the kid a little cake, but the man rejected it. I  _  he felt as if I had just abused him. Of course I didn't mean to. But I could understand why he felt like that. I only wished them good  _  whatever happened. The man opened the door to leave -- father and son hand in hand.",
