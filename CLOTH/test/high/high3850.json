We   had fun   playing basketball and shopping for cartoon books and became great friends. Then I got   _  .\nIn most   _   ,stepkids live with their mom and stepdad. This makes our case quite   _   . Four years into our marriage, after going between their mom's place and ours, the boys  _   in with us full-time.\nI was   no longer   a part-time friend, so everything changed. For example,   _   the kids to help didn't appear an important thing before, but now they became unwilling. Once, after I'd asked my elder stepson to set the table, he   _   said, \"You're not my mother; I don't have to   listen to   you.\"\nIt was   _   but I realized it was about keeping   _   clear in our new family life. I told him he was right--I wasn't his mom; I was another person in his life who   _   him, and we needed to get things done   _   .\n  _   in a life-in situation, a step-parent isn't the parent. You help with everything and   _   lots of hugs and laughs. But you also have to learn to stand in the   _   . For example, when there were only enough   _   for Mom and Dad to sit up front, I sat in back. It was hurtful, but I realized it wasn't personal.\nToday, my stepsons know where to find me, whether it's for long chats or a(n)   _   e-mail to say hi. And I know where to find them. The caring is surely there, even if the   _   isn't.",
