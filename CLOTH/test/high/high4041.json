I am just not good at making homemade bread into holiday-themed shapes like other mothers.  _  , I'm happy to try, even though it'll  _  me a long time to do it. People say that housewives should have the  _  to make delicious meals, keep their houses clean, and  _  every minute of their child's life. Their words used to  _  me a lot. I felt that I should also be able to do those things as a housewife. So  _  I couldn't make the turkey-shaped cookies, I  ended up  feeling like a failure as a mom. After many  _  attempts at baking, and many afternoons spent crying over my inabilities as a mother, I finally accepted the  _  that my lot in life is to be the juice box mom. I worked hard to be the  _  one in the elementary school. And after one of my daughter's class parties, it  paid off  . Her teacher stopped me as I was leaving and said, \"Thank you so much for always bringing  _  drinks. Sometimes parents forget that other children will also  _  class parties, and they end up being left out because we don't have enough  _  for everyone.\" I just accepted her appreciation, rather than telling her that I brought extra drinks because I could  _  remember how many kids were in the class. But her  _  taught me an important lesson: I'm not a failure as a mom. Not everyone is cut out to be a(n)  _  mom. I believe it's okay to be the juice box mom. I may not bake cookies and decorate them beautifully, but I  _  something to drink. And I think that's just as  _  .",
