    "article": "There was once a boy called Mario who loved to have loads of friends. He always  _  off how many friends he had at school. One day his grandfather said to him, \"Mario, I  _  you a big bag of popcorn that you don't have as many friends as you think. I'm sure many of them are nothing more than companions.\" Mario  _  the bet without hesitation. However, he wasn't sure how to test  _  his schoolmates were real friends or not, so he asked his grandfather. The old man answered, \"Wait a minute.\" Then the old man left,  _  soon as though carrying something in his hands, but Mario could see  _  there. \"Take it. It's a very special chair because it's invisible . It's rather  _  to sit on it, but if you take it to school and  _  to sit on it, you'll activate its magic and you'll be able to  _  who your real friends are. \" Mario, brave and determined, took the  _  and set off for school. At break time he asked everyone to form a(n)  _  , and he put himself in the middle, with his chair. Having difficulty seeing it, Mario tried to sit on it and  _  straight onto his backside. Everyone around him had a pretty good laugh. \"Wait!Let me try again,\" Mario said. But again, he missed the seat,  _  more surprised looks and a few catcalls (,). Mario didn't  give up  and kept trying to sit on the magic chair. But he kept falling onto the ground...until,  _  he tried again but didn't fall. Looking around, Mario saw three of his best friends  _  him up. Meanwhile, many others he had  _  as friends had done nothing but make  _  of him. And there, the show  _  to an end. Mario understood that true friends were those who  _  for him, and not just the companions that happened to be passing by. And someone who took joy in his misfortunes was even less of a friend.",
