    "article": "My parents were a team, as if they were one person. Sure, they  _  , but undoubtedly any   _   would be solved. They began their married life   _  , but they worked hard and,   _   the years built a very successful business .They had strengths and weaknesses, but so   _   as they worked together, you never saw weaknesses, just strengths.\nThe biggest   _  about love and marriage my parents taught us kids was how to talk \"about\" your partner. Have you ever heard husbands and wives make   _   remarks  about their partners? It's one those things people just seem to do. Sure, they are \"only kidding\" or maybe they are not. But words   _  . And words teach, whether positively or negatively. Dad always speaks of mom in positive words,   _   does she of him.\nOne day we were getting carpet fixed. The crew boss said, \"Women will really spend your money, won't they?\" Dad   _  , \"Well, they were right there with you before you had any money, it's a   _   to do anything for them you possibly can.\" This wasn't the answer the boss expected to hear. The crew boss  _   one more time, \"And they'll take that as far as they can, huh?\" Dad responded again, \"She's the best thing that has ever happened to me. I'll do anything to make her happy.\"\nI tried not to   _  . I knew he wanted Dad to   give in   just a little bit and say, \"Yeah, I guess that's true.\" But it wouldn't happen... not in a million years!\nMy parents are retired and still enjoying their life together, just   _   out, reading, shopping. Throughout the years,   _   Mom would remind me I should be   _   for someone to get married to, I'd say, \"Ma, I have plenty of time.\" She'd  _   reply \"I don't have 'that' much time\". Dad would then look at me and say, \"Hey, you   _   all the time you need. If you marry someone just   _   the woman your mother is, you'll have a great life.\"",
