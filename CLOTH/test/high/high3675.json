    "article": "A few years ago when my daughter was about two years old, I went through a difficult time. My marriage was   in trouble  , I was pregnant   and not particularly well and I didn't   _   much money. Looking back I think I was also a bit   _  , but I had to get on with taking care of my   _   the best I could.\nOne day I thought I would take my daughter for a nice day   _   at our park as she liked it there, and I thought it was a nice thing to do. I   _   to walk because the bus was   _  , so it took us a long time to get there. When we   _   got there, immediately my daughter began to cry. She was cold, she was   _  , and she wanted to go home.   To be honest  , I had not prepared properly. I didn't even have any money to buy a drink or to   _   the bus back home. I was so frustrated and my dream of a nice day   _  .\nI started   _   back home (it was nearly 2 miles), and my daughter would not  _   crying. I felt so miserable and angry with myself and my   _   that I started crying too.\nAt that point a car stopped and a gentleman   _   us a lift. He took us home, and seemed so   _   that he even offered me all his change ! The   _   of this stranger to a stranger like me really made me feel better. I   _   saw him again and I don't know who he is but he really helped me out that day, so I am just   _   to him.",
