    "article": "When a person is curious about something,it means he is interested in it and wishes to know more about it.There is  _  wrong with curiosity in itself.Whether it is good or bad  _  on what people are curious about. Curiosity is always silly or wrong.Some persons with nothing to do are  _  of curiosity about what their neighbours are doing.They are  _  to know what they are eating or drinking,what they are  _  home or taking outside,or  _  they have come home so early or late.To be interested in these things is  _  because they are not at all  _  .It is none of their  _  to know what their neighbours do or are doing.Such curiosity is  _  not only foolish but also  _  .For most probably,it  _  to a small talk which often brings harm,shame or disrespect to others,and thus  _  their feelings. On the other hand,there is a  _  curiosity--the curiosity of wise men,who  _  at all the great things and try to find out all they  _  about them.Columbus could  _  have found America if he had not been  _  .James Watt would not have made the steam engine  _  his curiosity about the raising of the kettle lid.All the discoveries in human history have been made  _  a result of curiosity.But the curiosity is never about unimportant things which have little or nothing to do with the happiness of the public.",
