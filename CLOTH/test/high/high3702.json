One day, Mrs Nanette O'Neill gave a maths 41 _  to our class. When the papers were   _  she discovered that twelve boys had made exactly the  _  mistakes throughout the test.\nThere is nothing really new about 44 _ in exams. Perhaps that was   _   Mrs O'Neill  didn't even say a word about it. She only asked the twelve boys to   _  after class. I was one of the twelve.\nMrs O'Neill asked   _  questions, and she didn't   _   us either. Instead, she wrote on the blackboard the   _  words by Thomas Macaulay. She then ordered us to copy these words into our exercise-books one hundred times.\nI don't know about the other eleven boys. Speaking for 50 _  I can say: it was the most important single   _  of my life. Thirty years after being  introduced to Macaulay's words, they 52 _  seem to me the best yardstick  , because they give us a 53 _  to measure ourselves rather than others.\n  _   of us are asked to make  55 _ decisions about nations going to war or armies going to battle. But all of us are called  56 _ daily to make a great many personal decisions. Should the wallet, 57 _  in the street, be put into a pocket or 58 turned over  to the policeman? Should the 59 _  change received at the store be forgotten or 60 _   ? Nobody will know except you. But you have to live with yourself, and it is always better to live with someone you respect.",
