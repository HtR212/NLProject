    "article": "My husband Val and I had not been getting along well lately. We didn't argue,but we hardly   _  . I  knew that one  _  was\nthat I often scold him. Unfortunately, I looked only at his faults and forgot\nto notice how  _  he had done in everything.\nI really didn't want to be   a wife  talking too much, but it\nalmost seemed as if I could not  help myself  .However, I  made up my mind to  have a change  .Could I?\nI decided to try. Each day I would find one thing I liked in  my husband  and mentioned it to him.The first day, again, appeared the greatest\nproblem. I noticed  quite a few  things I didn't like about Val. Why did he \nleave his books everywhere in his study instead of putting them  in order  ?How\ncould he wear that  _  shirt again? And I had a difficult time  coming up  with\nanything good I could mention.\nI thought and thought.  After all  he was good sometimes.When\nsomething needed repair around the house, Val  worked hard  until he\ndiscovered what was wrong.\n  The next day  ,I told Val I was glad he was patient with my faults and said  _  about the way I often scold him. He  smiled a\nsmall, weak smile that made me  _  ,\"Maybe this isn't going to work.\" I\nsaid to myself. But as  three weeks continued, finding something \ngood about my husband came  more easily  .He deals honestly with everyone; he\ntreats our children with  _  .Why had I seen so many unpleasant things?\nBy the end of the 21 days, I couldn't believe how easy  _  had\nbecome to praise Val. And Val did seem  different  .In fact, he\nmentioned that I seemed to have changed a lot.",
