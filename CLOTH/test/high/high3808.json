    "article": "I have been applying, interviewing, etc since July with no prospects . I have been told mostly that I am overqualified, or they need fulltime etc. I had been getting pretty down and discouraged. I was actually asking myself why can't someone be kind enough to take me on as an  _  . This past Tuesday evening it was  freezing cold  outside and going to be 9 pm as I was waiting at a bus stop. Just as the bus  pulled up  a young woman approached me. She had a T-shirt, Capri pants, and slippers on. She also was wearing several hospital bracelets. I  dug in  my purse and took out $5.00 so she could get something to eat. I then took off my jacket and  tennis shoes  and gave them to her. I said, \"These are a little big but they should keep  _  warm.\" She looked at me and said \"Aren't you going to be cold?\" I told her my being cold for 15 minutes  _  I got to my place was worth it if I knew she would be a little warmer. She sobbed and thanked me with a hug. I just told her to  pass it on  . Then after I got on the bus that's  _  the miracle of spreading  _  happened. I stepped up to pay the  _  and the bus driver said, \"Mam, I saw what you just did and your fare is  _  me, even though technically we aren't supposed to let you get on the bus without shoes.\" he said with a wink. A lady who was dressed in a very  _  business suit called me over to her seat. She said, \"I want to know the  _  of the person who just did the most  _  thing I have ever seen.\" I told her my name and she said , \"What can I do for you to  _  what I just witnessed?\" I  _  said a paying job would be nice. The next day she called me and said that she had a  _  administrative assistant position  _  in her company and wanted me to meet with the manager. It  turned out  that the lady was the head Human Resources person. I start Monday morning at 9am! Thank you all for inspiring me to keep passing the kindness on! I never expected to get so much back in return!",
