    "article": "I went to a dinner party at a friend's home last weekend and met her five-year-old daughter for the first time. Little Maya was all curly brown hair, dark eyes, and lovely  _  her shiny pink nightgown ( ) .I wanted to say, \"Maya, you're so  _  !\nTurn around and model that pretty gown for me. You're beautiful!\" But I didn't.\n\"Maya,\" I said,  _  into her eyes, \"it's very nice to meet you.\"\n\" Nice to meet you, too.\" She said, in that  _  , talking-to-adults, good girl voice.\n\"Hey, what are you reading?\" I asked. Her eyes got bigger, and the practiced, polite facial  _  gave way to real excitement over this  _  . But she seemed too  _  to answer me.\n\"I love books,\" I said. \"Do you?\"\nMost  _  do.\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"And I can  _  them all by myself now!\"\n\"Wow,  _  !\" I said. And it is, for a five-year-old.\n\"What's your favourite book?\" I asked.\n\"I'll go and get it! Can I read it to you?\"\nPurplicious was Maya's  _  , and a new one to me, as she sat next to me and  _  read aloud every word. Then I told her that I'd just  _  a book, and that I hoped she'd write one, too, one day. She was crazy  _  that idea. We were both sad when Maya had to go to bed,  _  I told her next time to choose another book and we'd read it.\nTry this the next time you meet a little girl. She may be  _  and unsure at first, because few people ask her about her  _  , but be patient and stick with it. Ask her what she's reading. What does she like and dislike, and why? You're just  _  an intelligent   conversation that respects her brain. Tell her about your  _  and accomplishments, and your favourite books. Set a good example for her of what a  _  woman says and does.",
