    "article": "My good friend and neighbor is dying. She has  _  more health problems through the years than anyone should have to tolerate. Now as she approaches her 57th birthday she knows that it will  _  be her last. She has started  _  a lot of her things. She has given all of us around her much more than just her things though. She has also given us her friendship, her kindness, and her joyful smile. She has given us her shining spirit that has made all of our lives so much  _  . When a local dog was  _  killed by a bear, my friend welcomed it into her home and nursed it back to  _  . When any of us needed anything she was there doing all that she could with a  _  full of love and a soul full of goodness. She did all of this too while her health  _  to grow worse and worse. My friend,  _  , is not afraid of death. She has told me several times that she believes it will only be like a brief  _  and then she will awaken in Paradise. I am  _  as well that she will fit right in there because she already has a lot of paradise within herself. It is the paradise within her that she has so freely and beautifully given to us all. We all have a bit of paradise within ourselves. She has shown me that the best way to enjoy that paradise is to  _  it with everyone you meet. I wish my friend only joy in her  _  days here and endless love and life in her coming days in Paradise.",
