    "article": "My parents had some strange rules when my sister and I were growing up. For example, they never  _  us soda or juice. Our choice was water or iced tea  _  no sugar. My mom's  _  for it was that she didn't like kids who only drank sweet drinks, or worse, kids who did not like  _  ! She wanted to teach us to like water or  other  unsweetened drinks that did not come in a bottle. We, on the other hand, wanted to  _  a coke when we ate out. Now I can make my own decisions, but I  _  choose juice or soda. I don't  think about  it. It's not because I don't like it. I'm just used to drinking water. Many people  _  to think that a kid needs juice. If the child can't get it, he or she will secretly buy this kind of drink elsewhere. I found this really  _  , since I was raised  _  no juice or soda, and I didn't really  care about  only having water. Now people  _  kids to make their own choices,  _  I grew up in a family where the children's opinions were seldom  _  for, and the parents made the final decisions.",
