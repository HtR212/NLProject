And when he got there, he saw a lot of fruit, but much of it was expensive. Then he saw one basket, a big basket of some very red, long fruit. And it was the cheapest in the shop, not expensive at all.\nSo he went up and asked, \" How much a kilo?\" And the shopkeeper said, \"Two Rupees.\" Two Rupees in India is _ , just like waste paper  . So he bought a whole kilogram of the fruit and started eating it. But _ he ate some of it: Oh, my God! His eyes watered, his mouth watered and burned, his eyes were burning, his head was burning and his face became _ . As he coughed   and was nearly out of breath, he jumped up and down, saying, \"Ah! Ah! Ah!\"\nBut he still continued   to eat the fruit! Some people looked at him and said, \"You're _ , man. Those are chilies  ! You can't eat so many; they're not good for you! People put just a little into food for taste. You can't just eat them like that; they're not fruit!\" But the master said, \"No, I can't stop! I _ money for them, and now I'll eat them. It's my money!\"\nWe do a lot of things like that. Sometimes we know there's no more hope that things will change in the future, we still continue just because we put a lot of money, time and love into it. Just like the man who ate the chilies but couldn't stop because he didn't want to waste the money.\nSo even if you lose something, let it go and move on. That's _ than continuing to lose.",
