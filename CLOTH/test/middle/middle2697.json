    "article": "Yesterday afternoon Misty and I were sitting on the grass _ the girls were playing at the park. We saw a(an) _ man pushing a shopping cart  and struggling with each step he took. On two different occasions, I heard him telling people that he was lost and I felt  _ as I noticed these people pay no attention to _   he said.\nAfter thinking about it for a moment, I _ that he probably had dementia . I walked over to him and asked him if he knew _ he was. He said that he didn't know. I asked his _  , and he told me his name was Ray. I asked him how long he had been walking and he said he had been lost for hours.\nAt this point, I walked over to Misty and told her what the _ was about and she called the police to let them know the situation. I walked back over to him and offered him  _   to drink. I asked him if he would like to join us at the park so that he could sit down. He agreed and as soon as he started to walk _ the support of the shopping cart, he was very unsteady  on his feet. I told him to lean on me while we walked and he did exactly that.\nIt turned out  that his family had reported him missing, so Misty and I let him know that we were going to wait with him until his family arrived to pick him up . I could tell that he was very nervous and uneasy., so I asked him if I could pray with him. He said he would love it . He grasped my hands as we began to pray. He said he was thankful to Misty and I, referring to us as \"beautiful angels\". Half an hour later, his daughter came. Her eyes were filled with tears as she thanked us for our kindness.\nI was so happy that God _ us the chance to do just what he would have done--the right thing and the loving thing. It truly is more blessed to give than to receive.",
