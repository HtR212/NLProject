    "article": "Mr. Smith lived in a village far away  _  a town . One day he felt very ill and every one  _  he would die . They sent for a doctor . The doctor  arrived  and looked at the man closely . The doctor asked for a pen and  _  paper to write down the name of the medicine . But there was no pen  _  paper because all the villagers never went to school before. The doctor had to use a piece of charcoal to write down the name of the medicine on the door of the house. \"Get this medicine for him .\" he said , \"and he will  _  get better .\" Mr Smith's family and friends didn't know  _  to do . They could not read the  _  writing . Then Mr. Smith's son had an idea . He shut  _  the door of the house , put it on his back and ran to the nearest town . He bought the medicine , he soon got rid of his  _  . He would not let anyone wash the magic words from the door .",
