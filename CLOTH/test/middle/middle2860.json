Try to  listen  to English on the radio and on TV. Don't just read the  _  that you use in the class. Go to the  library  or a bookshop and read easy English books. Try to  _  something in English as much as you can, such as the things you did during the day. These  _  are not hard, but they are the work that you  _  do. If you do them, with the  _  of your teacher, you will learn English  _  .",
