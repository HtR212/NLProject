    "article": "Several years ago, I was at a train station in Amsterdam. I saw a young homeless man  _  people for money so he could buy breakfast. Most of the  _  simply took no notice of the young man or gave him a dirty look. There was one exception though: an older, well-dressed lady. When the young homeless man moved  _  this elegant lady, she turned and looked straight into his eyes and  _  asked, \"How much do you need?\" I couldn't hear what the young man said but watched  _  the old man pulled several bills from her wallet and  _  them in the young man's hands. I don't know whether the young man actually used this money for breakfast or for some other purpose. What I do know is that I saw two completely different reactions to the same  _  . I saw people who were either afraid or annoyed or distrustful . And then I saw this old lady who  _  the homeless man as her brother. I decided then and there that, even though we have to be  _  in this world, I would rather be like her. Every day may bring us many chances for  _  . The key is to do it or not.",
