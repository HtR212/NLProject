They often say they have  _  more important things to do. What are these important things? Exams! They have to get themselves ready for all kinds of exams and tests in school, so many of them almost  _  bookworms. In the past in the summer holidays, they could do  _  they like, but now they have to spend all their time preparing for exams. So  _  have kept them away from going in for sports. Because of the pressure ( ) from their parents and teachers, they have to work harder and spend most of their time on  _  . As for the students themselves, they don't want to fail the exams  _  they want to continue their further studies. So it becomes necessary to give all of their spare time to their studies and  _  up their school sports. It is  _  that a good education cannot go without physical training, and the same is true that a quick mind hardly goes along with a(n)  _  body.
