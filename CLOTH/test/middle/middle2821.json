    "article": "It was the first day of school. I had a new classmate, a little old lady with a warm smile. She said, \"Hi, young man! I'm Rose. I'm 87 years old. Can I give you a hug? \" I said  _  , \"Of course!\" \"Why are you in college at  _  an age?\" I asked. She joked, \"I'm here to meet a  _  husband, get married, have children, and then travel around the world.\" \"No, seriously,\" I asked. \"I always  _  of having a college education. Now I'm getting one!\" she told me. After a year, Rose became popular. She easily made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she enjoyed the attention from  others  . At the end of the semester we invited Rose to  _  at our party. I'll never forget what she taught  _  . \"We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow  _  because we stop playing. Here are the  _  of staying young. You have to laugh and find humor every  _  . You've got to have a dream. When you  _  your dreams, you die!\" she said. \"There is a big  _  between growing old and growing up. Anybody can grow old. That doesn't take any talent or ability,\" she added. \"But to  grow up  , you have to find the chance in change. Have no regrets. We usually don't have regrets for what we did ,  _  rather for things we did not do.\" Finally we graduated from the college with Rose. One week  _  graduation, she died peacefully in her sleep. She taught us by example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.",
