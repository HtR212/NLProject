    "article": "A boy was walking home from school when he saw a large, red apple on the tree near a house. The boy didn't like eating  _  very much. He preferred a piece of chocolate if he was given the choice, but this time, seeing the nice apple, the boy wanted it very much. The more he looked at the apple, the  _  he felt and the more he wanted it. He stood on tiptoe , stretching as high as he could, but he was still unable to touch it. He began to  _  up and down, as high as he could, at the top of each jump stretching his arms to get the apple. Still it remained out of  _  . Not giving up, he thought, if he had something to  _  on, he could reach it. His school bag wouldn't give enough height and he didn't want to  _  the things inside, like his lunch box, pencil case, and Gameboy. Looking  _  , he hoped he might find an old box, a rock, or, with luck, even a ladder, but he found nothing that he could  _  . He had tried everything he could think to do. Without seeing any other choices, he gave up and started to walk away. At first he felt angry and disappointed thinking about how hungry he had become from his  _  , and how he really wanted that apple. The more he thought like this, the more unhappy he became. However, the boy of our story was a  _  one, even if he couldn't always get what he wanted. He started to say to himself, \"This isn't helpful. I don't have the apple and I'm feeling unhappy as well. There's  _  more I can do to get the apple. That is unchangeable. But we should try to  _  our feelings. If that's the case , what can I do to feel better?\"",
