We say them  when someone gives us a drink, helps us to pick up things, hands us a letter, lends us a book, gives us a book or a present.\n Another important word is \"please\". Many people forget to use it. It is not polite to ask someone to do something _ saying \"please\". We have to use it when we  ask for  something, too. It may be a book or a pencil, more rice or more tea. It may be used in the classroom, at home, at the bus stop or in a shop. We have to use \"please\" to make each  other _ .\nWe have to _ to say \"sorry\" too. When we have hurt someone, we go up and say we are _  . When we have told lie ( ) and feel sorry, we use the same word. When we have forgotten something or broken something, we use the word \"sorry\", too. \"Sorry\" is a word that can make people forget wrongs.",
