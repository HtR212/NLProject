    "article": "(15;l,15) Mr Clarke works in a middle school. He likes reading and often  _  some books from the library. He  _  to the radio every morning and reading  _  after supper. So he knows much and teaches well. His  _  worship him very much. Mike, Mr Clarke's little son, is only nine. He  _  likes reading books. And he often asks his father some questions. Mr Clarke always thinks he's too  _  to understand him and chooses  the easiest  ones to answer. Of course the boy is not satisfied with(...) it. One day Mike read  _  about the electric lights and was  interested in  it. When his father told him to do some housework, he went on thinking of it. He asked him  a few  questions, and his father answered all. Then his father said proudly, \"Fathers always know  _  than sons!\" The boy thought for a while and said,  I don't think so  \" \"Oh? Why?\" Mike didn't answer and asked,  _  , \"Who invented the electric lights?\"  Thomas Edison  \"answered Mr Clarke. \"Why didn't his father invent them, then?\" Looking at his son, Mr Clarke didn't know  _  to answer!",
