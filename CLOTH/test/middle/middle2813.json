    "article": "My class and I visited Chris Care Center in Phoenix, Arizona to comfort the old people who needed a little cheering up during the holiday season.\nThe first two _ there were for persons requiring help in taking care of themselves. We sang _  for them. They loved our sweet songs and the flowers that we left with them.\nAs we were _ on the third floor for old people with Alzheimer  , most of them stared at the walls or floor. However, one lady  _ my eye. She was sitting by the door, in a wheelchair, singing songs to herself. They weren't the songs that we were singing, at least they didn't _ like that. As we got _  with each song, she did as well. The louder we got, the louder she got. _   she was singing, she was also _ out to us with her hands and body. I knew that I should have gone over to her, but I thought that my   _  were to my students. People who worked at the care center could attend to her, I thought. Just when I stopped feeling _ about not giving her the attention she needed, one of my students, Justin, showed me what the holiday season is really about.\nJustin also  _ the same lady. The difference between us is that he _ on her needs, but I didn't. During the last song, \"Silent Night,\" Justin walked over to her and held her hand. He looked this aged lady in her   eyes and with his actions said, \"You are important, and I will take my _ to let you know that.\"\nThis tired, elderly lady stopped singing and held his hand. Then she touched his cheek  with the other hand. Tears began to fall down her face. No _ can completely describe that touching moment...\nIt _ a boy to teach me, a man, about kindness and love. Justin's example of a complete, selfless attitude toward another was a lesson that I will never forget. He was the teacher that day.",
