Then each time his corn was the _ and won the first prize.\nOne year a newspaper reporter interviewed him and learned _ surprising about how he grew it. The farmer  offered  his seed  corn to  his neighbors .\n\"How can you _ your best seed corn with your neighbors?\" the reporter asked in surprise.  \"You know they are taking part in the competition with you each year.\"\nBut the farmer said _ , \"Didn't you know? The wind picks up pollen {)from the corn and moves it quickly from field to field. It will affect the quality of my corn. So if I want to grow good corn, I must help my neighbors to grow good corn. \"\nThe farmer knew his corn couldn't improve _ his neighbor's corn improves.\nAs a great man says, \"We make a living by what we  get; we make a life by what we give.\" We can't   live _ food, clothes, and many other things. However, a meaningful life is not decided by how much we can get,   but   by how much we can give others.\nGiving, intead of taking, makes us   different   from other animals.  So those who choose to live well must help others to live well and those who choose to be happy must help others to find   happiness in their lives.",
