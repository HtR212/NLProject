She was _ in all the things in the garden and always had lots of questions to ask.\n\"Why do you have big rocks in your garden, Grandma?\" Emma asked _ she was watering lettuce. Grandma was doing some digging. \"Keep your eyes open,\" she said, \"One day you will see why.\"\nEmma looked at the rocks every time she went into Grandma's garden. They just sat there, as if   they were waiting _ her to find out their secret. .\nOne morning Emma went into Grandma's garden to _ tomatoes. It had rained the night before, so it was a bit _ . But now the sun was shining warmly. _ Emma stopped and looked. On a big rock near her sat two beautiful yellow -and-black butterflies  . As Emma watched, the butterflies were ready to fly, soon they flew away. Emma looked closely at the rocks. But they looked _ special. Emma touched one. She smiled. She picked the tomatoes quickly and ran back into Grandma's house.\n\"I know why you have big rocks in your garden, Grandma!\" she called. Grandma laughed. \"This cool morning gave you the answer, _ it?\" She said. \"Yes,\" said Emma. \"I saw butterflies sitting on the rocks, warming themselves so they could fly.\" \"That's it,\" said Grandma. \"They can't fly when their bodies are cold.\" \"I wonder how they know the sun warms the rocks,\" said Emily. \" Another mystery  !\" said Grandma.\nEmma laughed. \"I'll have to work on that one,\" she said. \"But I know one thing, Grandma. When I grow up, I'm going to have a garden just like _ . And it will have lots and lots of butterfly rocks!\"",
