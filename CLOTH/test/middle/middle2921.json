    "article": "Today, I want to write something about my mother. When I had something difficult to do, I often asked my mother for  _  . But she always said, \"Do it yourself, dear.\" I was not happy about this at all. I thought she was the  laziest  mother in the world. For example, one day, I decided to  _  some friends to my home. My bedroom was not in order . Books were  _  , and I didn't make the bed. I asked my mother to help me clean it,  _  she still said, \"Do it yourself, girl.\" Because of my \"lazy mother\", I had to  _  my clothes and clean my room. I have to help my parents do  _  . I even had to go to the dentist by myself. It was really hard for me to do everything well, but I have  _  a lot. As time goes by, I understand my mother. She made me clever and diligent .  _  a great mother! A  _  mother is worth one hundred teachers! Don't you think so?",
