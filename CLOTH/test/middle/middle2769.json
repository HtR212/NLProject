They have not eaten for days.\" After I asked him where the family was, I took some  _  with me and left. When I finally got to that family, I  _  those little children were too hungry to say  a word  . I gave the food to the mother. She took half of it, and then  went out  . When she returned, I asked her, \"  _  did you go?\" She gave me this simple  _  , \"To my neighbours -- they are also  _  !\" I was not surprised that she gave the food to others, because poor people are always very  _  . But I was surprised that she gave her  _  half the food when her children were still hungry. Usually, when we are in trouble, we always think of ourselves first, and we have no time for others.",
