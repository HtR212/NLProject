When I came home at night, Mum asked,\" How did you  _  your lunch, dear?\" I answered, \"I made some new friends in the supermarket, twin brothers, their mom and dad. They were my customers. They invited me  _  lunch.\nMum was happy that I had made new friends but she wanted to know what kinds of  _  they might be.\nSeveral days later, I asked my friends to come to the supermarket where I worked  _  let Mum meet them. Mum was very  _  to find out that the twin brothers were joined at the chest . She felt very strange because I didn't tell her about that before.\nWhen Mum asked me about this , I said,\" I know that too. But do you know that their mom has to make all clothes because it's  _  difficult to find anything to fit them? They are also good  _ . That day, Joe, the one on the right , made me noodles for lunch.\"\nWhen Mom saw the twins, she must have thought how strange they  _ . But to me, what I cared about was that they had difficulty _ clothes and they were good cooks,",
