So she was  _  now and wanted to have something there. The waiter received the visitor  _  . But he knew little English and the woman couldn't speak French. They talked for a while  _  couldn't understand each other. She had to point to her  _  and then slapped the dog's belly . The waiter seemed to know  _  she wanted and carried the dog into the kitchen. About half an hour some dishes were brought to the woman. They were all  _  and she was pleased with them. After she paid for her bill. She didn't leave. She waited for a while and said  _  to the waiter and they began to quarrel . Just at that moment the manager came back. He talked with the woman and then with the waiter. At last he understood. The English woman told the waiter to  _  her dog, but he thought she told him to cook it for her!",
