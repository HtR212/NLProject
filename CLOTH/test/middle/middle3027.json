I was sad and had lost my confidence. I decided to go to a class which can tell me how to be  _  . The speaker walked into the room. But he did not start talking  _  a teacher. Instead, he held up a twenty Yuan note ! \"Who wants this?\" he asked. Unsurprisingly,  _  of us in the class held up our hands. The speaker smiled. Then he put up the note on the blackboard and asked the same question. Again, we all put up our hands. The speaker smiled again, but  _  nothing. Suddenly, he threw the note onto the floor! Then he asked the same  _  a third time. I didn't  _  what the speaker was doing. Why was he asking the same question again and again? I didn't know what to do. I wanted the note,  _  I put my hand up again. After a while, he  picked up  the note and started to laugh. \"You have all just told me how to become successful,\"  _  said to us with the note in his hand. \"The note is worth twenty yuan. It is  _  worth twenty yuan, even though I throw it on the floor. You are like the note. No matter  _  happens to you, you still have your worth.\" When I heard those words, I was deeply moved. Suddenly, I  _  I was worth a lot. I may have done badly in an exam, but it doesn't  _  I can't do well in the future. If I believe in myself, I will be successful!",
