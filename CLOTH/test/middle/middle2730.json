    "article": "These days,cars are designed using computers.Let's look at how a new car is created. First,several  _  talk about the new car and any good ideas that they have.Then they sit down at their computers and  _  many sketches.The best two or three drawings are chosen and then more detailed drawings of  _  are developed on the computer.You can change the size,shape or color of any part on the computer to see  _  the car would look and then you can choose the best design. Both the inside and the outside of the car have to be designed.Part of the inside of the car is  _  so that the designers can sit in it.They can feel if there is enough  _  inside and if they can reach  _  .Then some cars are built-there are more than 15,000 parts of a car to  _  . When everything is known to be  _  ,the cars are made in the factory.Again,computers are used to make sure that all the parts are  _  as they are needed.The factory usually stays open all through the night so that the car production never stops.",
