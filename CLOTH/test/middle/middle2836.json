    "article": "The best woman in the world is my mother; the sweetest sound in the world is mother's  _  . Each day when I get back home from school, I see my mother cooking in the kitchen  _  and happily. I really want to give her an embrace . Mother often said:\" Parents don't want a return from their  _  . The one thing they hope to see is their kids have a happy life.\" My mother is different from my classmates' mothers. When she  gave birth to  me, she was nearly 42 years old. When I become a university student, my mother will be 60 years old. My mother is in  _  health for a long time. She suffers from a very serious illness. Maybe she will never fully recover .  _  she still works hard for me every day. I want to help her but don't know what I can do or  _  to start. Each time my mother can't get up from her sick bed, I feel  _  and don't want to go to school. But mother always says to me lightly: \"You must go to school. I can  look after  myself.\" Hearing this, I wonder if I am not a good son. The  _  thing I can do is to give her a warm embrace after school.",
