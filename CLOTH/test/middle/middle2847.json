In many countries, New Year begins on January1st, but people start celebrating on December 31st, New Year's Eve. In New York, many people go to celebrate in Times Square. While they're waiting for the New Year, they  listen to  music, sing traditional songs and have fun. Just before 12 o'clock, everyone  _  down from 10, 9, 8 ... As soon as it' s 12 o'clock, everyone shouts very loudly, \"Happy New Year!\" and they say, \"Out with the old year and in with the new!\" Suddenly there  _  fireworks and special drinks. Sometimes people sing an old song  _  \"Auld Lang Syne\". New Year's Day is often a family day. Some people relax at home. Some families get together for a special  _  with grandparents, aunts and uncles. When the weather is  _  , many families go out for a walk. On New Year's Day, many people make resolutions for the new year. They write down a list of things, such as \"I will help out more at home. I will work harder at school.\" Or \"I won't spend so much time  _  video games.\" When they have made their list, they read it to their family or friends. So it does not matter how they celebrate, for people in countries all over the world, it is a time to  _  goodbye to the old year, and to welcome the new.",
