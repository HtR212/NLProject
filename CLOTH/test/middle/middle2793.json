There was  _  inside it  _  some changes and an old photo--a picture of a woman and a young girl of about twelve years old who looked  like  the woman's daughter. I put the photo back and  _  the purse to police station,  _  I handed it to an officer. Before I left, the officer took my name and address  so that  the owner might want to write and thank me.",
