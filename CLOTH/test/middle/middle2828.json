He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to make  _  body through that little hole. Suddenly it stopped. So the boy  _  to help the butterfly, thinking the butterfly might be  _  .He took a pair of scissors and cut the hole  _  .The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it  _  a little different. It had a weak body and small, thin  _  .The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The boy acted with  _  but he didn't understand why it could be like this. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of  getting  out of the cocoon makes the fluid from the butterfly's body into its wings. It helps the butterfly be  _  to fly. If the butterfly never has to squeeze itself out of the cocoon, its wings will never get the fluid and it can never fly.  Sometimes  struggles are what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be  as strong  as we could have been and we would never fly. In our lives, pain and suffering is the key to all windows, and sometimes even  _  growth, without it , there's no way of life. We can't avoid  _  or problems. So, next time you are  faced with  a problem or difficulty, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little----then fly!",
