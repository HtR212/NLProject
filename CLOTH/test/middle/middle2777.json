At least that was what I had told him--  _  I had an important question to ask--that had been on my mind for a couple of weeks and this was the first time I had been able to  _  with him alone. \"Dad...\"I started. And  _  . \"Yes?\" he said. \"The kids say there is no Father Christmas. They say I'm  _  to believe in Father Christmas anymore...it's only for little kids. But I believe what you told me. Father Christmas is  _  . He is, isn't he, Dad?\" \"The real life and spirit of this magical elf lives forever in your heart, my heart, Mom's heart and in the hearts and minds of  _  people who believe in the joy that giving to others brings. The real  _  of Father Christmas becomes what you can give rather what you get. Once you understand this and it becomes  _  of you, Father Christmas becomes even more exciting and more magical because you come to  _  the magic comes from you when Father Christmas lives in your heart. Do you understand what I am  _  to tell you?\" My heart was filled with pride and I'm sure my eyes were shining with  _  .\" Of course, Dad. I want him to be in my heart, just like he's in yours. I love you, Daddy. You're the best Father Christmas who has  _  been in the whole world.\" When it comes time in my life to  _  the reality of Father Christmas to my children, I hope that I will be as eloquent and  _  as my dad was the day I learned that the spirit of Father Christmas doesn't wear a red  _  . And I hope they will accept me as I did that day. I'm sure they will.",
