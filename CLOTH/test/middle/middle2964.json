I forget what the argument was about, but I will never forget the  _  I learned that day.\nI thought that I was right and he was wrong. _  he thought that I was wrong and he was right. The teacher _  to teach us a very important lesson. She brought us to the front of the class and asked him to stand on one side of her desk and me on  the other . In the middle of her desk was a large , round ball. I could  _  see that was black . She asked the boy what color the ball was.\"White,\" he answered.\nI couldn't  _ he said the ball was white, while it was obviously black! Another argument started  _  us. This time it was about the  _ of the ball. The teacher told us to change the places and then asked me what color the ball was. I answered, \"White.\" It was a ball with  _  differently colored sides, and from his side it was white. Only from my side it was black.\nSometimes we need to  look at  problems from the other person`s opinion in order to truly understand his or her opinion.",
