    "article": "I was recently invited to dinner by a friend. During the meal, the manager came over and said that our meal was free. He stood there  _  at me, he seemed to know me.  _  I asked if he knew me. He laughed and said I had probably  _  him, but I had changed his life. He said that twelve years ago he was in  _  stress management class. I asked the group what their number one stress was and  _  of them, including him, said it was their  _  . He said I listened carefully and then took a chair and placed it in the center of the room. I  _  on the chair for a few minutes and then I invited everyone to do the same. I wanted them to look at the room from  _  there. After everyone had done it, I asked the group to think about how  _  the room looked when they changed their perspective . Then I asked them to  _  their bosses. Was this the same person who had seen their good  _  and hired them? Do they remember how happy they were to be  _  for the job? How did these wonderful people become terrible bosses? He said I looked at him and asked if he had  _  said thank you to his boss for the opportunity to make a living. He answered no. He told me his  _  changed that night. He went back to work with a  _  card to his boss. He had been the manager for 8 years. He said he owed it all to me: I had taught him to look at life from different perspectives and I had taught him to express gratitude.",
