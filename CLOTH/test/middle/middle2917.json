    "article": "Jenny, from Germany, spent some time traveling in India. While she was there, she stayed with her Indian friend, Leela. However, there was a language barrier for her there. It was very  _  for her to communicate in the new environment, which was very different from  _  of her own country. One day, together with Leela, Jenny went to  _  an orphanage . All the children there were very young. At first, Jenny was not sure if she could have a way to communicate with them. She went over to the children  _  and sat beside them. After some time, one of the children  smiled at  her. She felt a little relaxed and smiled back. Then she went close to the child. She slowly put her arm around the child and started  _  a song in German. The child kept smiling and started repeating the words after her. The words that came from the little mouth were different from those that Jenny sang, but the rhythm was the same. Jenny sat a little more and the child followed her again. Wanting to join in the  _  , another child went up to Jenny and started singing the rhythm. Then more children joined. They  _  many smiles together. From the other side of the hall, Leela was smiling and watching them. Noticing Leela's  _  on her, Jenny had an exciting feeling from her heart: \"See, I don't have any language barriers here. We  _  speak and communicate!\" At that moment, she understood: we're all simple human, and we have the ability to connect with each other.",
