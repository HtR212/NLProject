    "article": "Dear friends, Do you remember your first day at a new school or in a new area? How about the  _  when your family  _  to a new state? Ugh! What about the feelings of being a stranger? Then, with time, you find someone who likes  _  you like. Friends are great gifts in life. I have good friends too, but not because they are completely  _  .Sometimes they talk too much; sometimes they need me a lot. I know I ask too much of them. I hope my friends, like my father,  _  about me a lot. I once told my friends to give me all their love and be generous and gentle. I told my friends, in other words, to love me  _  I loved them. They didn't  _  me at first, but then they became kinder. My love for them slowly made them learn to  _  friends. They learned to love others and  _  the idea that LOVE is part of life. If we listen to and try to understand each other, love  _  .We should work on it, even if it's hard at first. A true friend loves US at all times. Your friend, Jesus",
