They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of  _  would be considered a very poor family. On their return from their trip, the father asked his son, \"How was the trip?\" \"It was great, Dad. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they have a creek that has no  _  . We have imported lanterns in our garden and they have the  _  at night. Our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the  _  horizon . We have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go  _  our sight. We buy our food, but they grow  _  .\" With this the boy's father was speechless . Then his son added , \"Thank dad for showing me how  _  we are.\" Too many times we forget what we have and concentrate on what we don't have. What is one person's worthless object is another's prize possession . It is all  based  on one's opinion. Make you wonder what would happen if we all gave thanks for all the bounty we have,  instead of  worrying about wanting more . Take joy in all you have.",
