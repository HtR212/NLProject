The Hunan girl was first  _  when she got two gold medals in the 2008 National Championships in Tianjin.  _  thought Sui would go to the Beijing Olympics. But Sui made a few small  _  in the following two World Championships in Russia and France. She wasn't  _  to be in the Olympic team. The  _  girl cried her heart out.

She proved  _  again at the 11th Chinese National Games. At the Games she  _  two gold medals. Now, Sui's  _  is to go to the 2016 Olympics. 'I've  _  been to the Olympics,' said Sui.
