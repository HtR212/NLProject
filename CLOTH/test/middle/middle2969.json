    "article": "Two little boys were playing one day when a Fairy suddenly appeared before them and said, \"Father Time asks me to  _  you New Year presents.\" She handed each child a package and disappeared immediately. Carl and Philip opened the  _  and found two books with clean pages in them. Twelve months passed and the  _  came again and said, \"I have brought you another two books and will take the first one back to Father Time.\" \"May I keep  _  book a little longer?\" asked Philip, \"I'd like to paint something on the last page.\" \"No,\" said the Fairy. \"I wish that I could finish reading mine at a time,\" said Carl, \"I can only open the book once each day  _  see only one page every time, because when the page turns over, it sticks fast.\" The Fairy said, \"Well, you can  look at  Philip's book.\" Then she lit two little lamps for them. By the light of the  _  they saw the pages as she turned them. \"Who did this?\" they asked in surprise, \"Every page was  _  when we first opened it. But now some pages are drawn with beautiful things like birds and  _  and some pages with ugly, black spots and scratches on them!\" The Fairy, smiling at the two little  _  , said, \"See, Philip, the beautiful birds and flowers appeared when you share toys with your friends, or when you try to be kind to others.\" \"But what made the ugly,  _  spots and scratches?\" asked Philip. The Fairy said, \"That came when you told a lie one day, or when you did not listen to your mum. All these ugly spots and scratches in your books were made when you were naughty . Each pretty thing in your books came on its page when you were  _  .\" \"Oh, we wish to read the books  _  !\" \"They can't be read once more,\" said the Fairy, \"See! They are only for this year, and they must now go back into  Father Time's  bookcase, but I have brought you each a new one, and perhaps you can make these more beautiful than the first ones.\" With these words, the Fairy  _  . The boys were left alone, but each held in his hand a new book open at the first page. And on the back of each book was written in letters of gold, \"For the New Year\".",
