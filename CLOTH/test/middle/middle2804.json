During those days, the office was often filled with people who had a cold, which made me even busier than usual. It seemed I was going to be late _ home and my husband would be ready to pronounce me late once again. But maybe _ I hurried, I could still make it.\nI was heading inside to _ for my gas when I noticed an old couple at the counter. I heard them asking the _ to the nearest hospital. It was the hospital that I had just _ a few minutes ago.\nThe young man at the counter was trying to be _ by explaining how to get there. But the fact was that he was telling them a whole _ route. So I walked over to the couple and said, \"Would you like to _ me to the hospital?\" Then I saw a look of relief over their faces. \"I'm going there, too,\" I said, which wasn't a lie since I had just _ up my mind to do it perfectly.\nI got in my car and began to drive _ . I looked back several times to be _ they were right behind me. It took us only fifteen _ to get there as rush hour traffic was beginning to die down.
