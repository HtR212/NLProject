    "article": "It was a cold afternoon in winter. My oldest son, Stephen, was at school, and Reed, my husband, at work. My  _  little ones were sitting around the kitchen table. Tom was perfecting a paper plane, while Sam was  _  on an oil painting. But Laura, our only daughter, sat quietly and was  _  in her project. Every once in a while she would ask how to  _  the name of someone in our family, then carefully form the letters one by one. Next, she would add flowers with small items. She finished off each with a sun in the upper right hand corner. Holding them at eye level, she let out a long sigh of  _  . \"What are you doing, Honey?\" I asked. She looked quickly at her brother before looking back at me. \"It's a  _  .\" she said, covering up her work with her hands. Next, she put her work into a box. When she had finished, she disappeared up the stairs. It wasn't until later that evening that I  _  a \"mailbox\" taped onto the doors to each of our bedrooms. There were little notes saying that she loved all of us. She hadn't  _  Sam or baby Paul. They are pages of colored scenes including flowers with happy faces. \"He can't read yet,\" she whispered , \"  _  he can look at the pictures.\" Each time I received one of my little girl's gifts, it  _  my heart. I was touched at how carefully she paid attention to what wrong happened to us. When Stephen lost a baseball game, there was a letter telling him she thought he was the best ballplayer in the whole world. After I had a  _  day, there was a message thanking me for my efforts. This same little girl is grown now, driving off every day to the state college, but some things about her have  _  changed. Yesterday I found a love note next to my bedside. \"Thanks for always being there for me, Mom,\" it read, \"I'm glad that we're the best friends.\" There are angels among us. I know I live with one.",
