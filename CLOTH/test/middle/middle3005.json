    "article": "Yesterday, I read a report on a charity show in a newspaper. The aim of the show was to  _  money for the poor children. In the country areas, some children are out of school  _  their parents can't  _  for their education.  _  my surprise, many famous performers  took part in  the charity show, such as Andy Liu, Jay, Faye Wang, Kitty Chen and so on. The stars didn't ask for any pay. They did it for  _  ! There were a lot of performances  _  singing and dancing. The  _  was  _  excited that they clapped their hands from time to time. Of course, the show was  successful  . All the people followed the star's example. A great number of people showed their generosity in  _  their money to the show. Both the ticket money and the donated money were soon sent to the poor areas and some of the poor children can get back to school now. Now many charity shows are held in our country, not only to  _  education in poor areas  but also  to help people in trouble. As the Chinese saying goes, \"All the others will come to one's rescue  _  one is in trouble.\" I  _  the whole world will become better if every one of us gives charity to others.",
