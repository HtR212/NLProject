We worked hard  _  it was getting dark. After we finished our work, we realized that we hadn't brought our umbrellas to school  _  it wasn't raining then. All of our classmates,  _  Xiao Ling and me, were taken home by their parents.  _  noticed us and we felt lonely and afraid. We waited and waited until Xiao Ling's grandma came. She asked Xiao Ling to go with her. But Xiao Ling  _  do. She said to her grandma, \"I can't leave my friend alone.\" Xiao Ling's grandma said, \"well, let's go first. Maybe her parents will come soon.\" \"Oh, no, her parents work in a faraway place. They won't come. I can't leave without taking her,\" Xiao Ling insisted . I was so  _  that tears came into my eyes. At last we shared the same umbrella in the rain. When I got home, the rain stopped. A ray of colorful  _  came out.
