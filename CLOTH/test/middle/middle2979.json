    "article": "In English the weather is changable. It is a  _  subject of conversation. \" Isn't it a nice day?\" \"Do you think it will rain?\" \"I think it's going to snow. \" People often  start  a conversation  _  these words . Many people think they can tell what the weather is going to be like, but they hardly ever agree with each other.  A man  may say,\"Do you see  it is cloudy  in the east ? It's going to rain tomorrow . \" Another man will say,\"No . It's going to be fine . \" People often  look for  the weather they want. When a farmer needs water , he looks for something to tell him. \" It's going to rain. \" He won't believe anything else. When friends have a picnic , they hope the weather is going to be fine and they can  sit  under the blue sky . Almost everyone  listens to  what the weather will say. But he doesn't always  _  us what we want , and sometimes he makes mistakes . Still he usually  comes  closer to being correct than anyone else.",
