You can see even  _  with a telescope. You might see stars where you only saw dark space before. You might see that many stars look larger than others. You might see that some stars  _  look white are really red or blue. But scientists believe there are some things in the sky that we  never see  . We can't see them with the biggest telescope in the world, even when it is the clearest night of the year. That's  _  they're invisible. They're the mysterious dead stars called black holes. You might find  _  hard to imagine that stars die. After all, our Sun is a star. Year after year we see it up in the sky, burning brightly, giving us heat and light. The Sun certainly doesn't seem  to be  getting old or weak. But stars do burn out and die after billions of years. As a star's gases burn, they give off light and heat. But when the gas runs  _  , the star stops burning and begins to die. So the next time you stare up at the night sky, remember: there's more in the sky than that meets the eye.  What  amazing space it is!",
