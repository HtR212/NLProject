    "article": "\"Look, it's Baldy!\" A boy shouted in my direction across the playground. Even though I was used to regular insults because of the  _  on my hed, it was  _  horrible to hear. I sighed as I headed back to the class. When I was just 20 months old, I suffered serious  _  after a bowl full of hot oil fell on my head. I was  _  to hospital and had to say there for weeks while the doctors  _  to save my life. \"Holly's very  _  to be alive,\" they told Mum and Dad. \"But she'll be  _  with scars on her head, and of course her hair won't grow there.\" As a child, I cared much about my scars, so I  _  wore a scarf to cover them up when I left home.  _  I didn't, people would call me horrible names like Baldy. Although my friends were always comforting me ,they never  _  understood how it felt. Then through the hospital I was  _  to a children's burns camp, where children like me can get any help. There, I  _  14-year-old Stephanie, whose burns are a lot more serious than mine. But she is so  _  that she never lets anyone put her down. \"You shouldn't  listen to  what people say about what you look like because we're not different from anyone else, Holly,\" she  _  me. \"And you don't need to wear a scarf because y0ou look great  _  it!\" For the first time in my life I could speak to someone who'd been through something  _  . So weeks later, at my 13th birthday party,  _  by her bravery, I gave up my scarf and showed off my scars. It felt amazing not having to  _  away behind my scarf. Now, I am  _  of what I look like and much happier, because I have realized it is your personality that decides who you truly are.",
