    "article": "New rules and Behavior Standards for middle school students came out in March. A middle school is going to start new rules  to decide  who the top students are. The best students will  not only  have high marks, they will also be ones who don't color their hair, smoke or drink. The following are more of the new rules. Tell the truth. Have you ever copied  someone else's  work in an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something  _  students should do. If you are playing computer games in your room, don't tell your parents you are doing homework. Do more activities at school. Good students love animals and  care for  others. April is Bird Loving Month in China. Is your school doing anything to celebrate it? You should join! That way you can learn more about animals and  how to protect  them. When more people work together, it brings us more  _  . Learn to co-operate. When your basketball team is  _  , only working together can make your team  stronger  . Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself. Be open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll  discover  Earth II someday. Don't look down upon new ideas. All the ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone. Pay attention to your safety. You should not walk  _  outside, especially at night.  Make sure  where the public phones are. If  anything dangerous  happens, you can find them quickly. If you take a bus to a place far away, please don't sleep. This stops a stranger from  stealing  money from you. Use the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for your studies.  _  not everything on the Internet is fit for kids. You may enter healthy websites for your homework or just for fun.",
