My father asked me to sit  next to  him and handed me this watch which was a gift from  _  . It weighed 8 oz and all of it was made of silver . Then he said, \"Essa, did you have fun  _  your friends today? What you did was not very nice and you should be sorry for your  _  .\" I felt sorry and told my father that I wouldn't do it again.
