    "article": "It was the last day of school and I planned to travel to my friend's hometown. I hadn't seen him for years and this was a good  _  to meet him again. I was busy at school so it was rather  _  when I came back home. It was already 10 o'clock at night. Time was running out. After a hurried meal I left.  _  I found a taxi very soon. Asking the driver to drive me fast to the station, I relaxed for a while, imagining what my friend looked like now. I was soon at the station and was sure that I would be able to  _  the train. Unfortunately, I fell on the way and lost some time. To my complete  _  , when I reached the platform, I saw that the train had just left! It was the last train so I had to  _  home. My mother was glad to see me back as she had a feeling about my trip. But I was unhappy. I tried to relax and went to bed but I had a  _  sleep. The next morning I was very tired. As I was having breakfast the  _  arrived. I read over the pages and was shocked to  _  that the train I missed had had an accident. How  _  I was that I missed the train!",
