Many college students, like Ellen, do this often. They think that in the morning, they will  _  everything that they studied the night before. Ellen thinks that this is a good way to study, but many doctors  _  . They say that sleep is very important for memory and brain development. Scientists at Harvard Medical School in the USA studied sleep and memory. They studied 24 people. First, they asked the people to look at a picture and  _  t. At night, they put the people in  _  groups of 12. Group One went to sleep. Group Two did not. A few days later, scientists showed some  _  to both groups. They asked the people to find the picture they  _  before. The people in Group Two did not do so  _  as those in Group One. It wasn't  _  for them to remember the picture. What happened? Scientists say that sleep  _  our memory. After we learn something new, sleep helps us remember it. And when we don't sleep, we can  _  new things. Scientists say that many teenagers, like Ellen, sleep too  _  They go to school and work, too. They also  _  time with their friends. They're always  _  and they think sleep isn't important.
