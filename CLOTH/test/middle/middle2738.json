    "article": "Jim is a boy who thinks a lot and learns a lot. One day when he was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped. He saw a group of elephants and these big animals had a rope around their front  _  . The rope was very  _  , so the elephants could break it easily. But to his surprise,  _  did not. Jim saw a trainer near the elephants. Then he walked over and asked him  _  . \"Well,\" the trainer said, \"When they were very young and much smaller , we used the same  _  ropes to tie around their legs and, at that age, they were sure they  _  hold them. As they get bigger and bigger, thy still believe the ropes can hold them, so they  _  try to get away.\" Jim thought a lot  _  that. These animals could break their ropes at any time, but because they  _  they couldn't, they didn't give it a try. Like the  _  many of us believe that we can't do something in our life, just because we didn't do it successfully in the past.",
