People  _  coming into such a dirty place and the poor man was lonely and sad every day. He thought it was poverty  that led to  his unhappy life.  One day, the poor man dropped in on a wise old man and asked him for  _  about changing his life. The old man gave him a beautiful vase  and said, \"This is a magic vase that will bring you  _ .\"  The poor man looked at the vase  _  . Why would he need a vase in his poor house? However , he didn't want to  throw away  such a beautiful vase, so he brought it home on the table.  \"It.s not right for something so beautiful to be  _ .\" the poor man looked at the vase and thought. Then he picked some wild flowers and put them into it, making it even more beautiful.   _  he was still not satisfied . \"It is not good for such a beautiful thing to stand next to a spider web.\" At this, he started to do some cleaning in the house and paint the walls.  His house turned into  _  place immediately. The poor man  cheered up  . He suddenly realized that in the past it was his laziness that made him poor and unhappy. From then on, he worked hard and his life got better and better.",
