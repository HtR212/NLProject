But a huge rock fell from a nearby mountain and stopped in the middle of the road.\nWhen the earthquake _ , many people came to the road and saw the huge rock. Some of the strongest men tried to lift the rock _ the road. But they couldn't move it. They tried to push it but failed. They tried to _ it with ropes but nothing worked.\n\"Well,\" they all agreed, \"There's nothing we can do about it. We'll have to change the _ .\" At this time a boy of 12 years old said, \"I think I can help you to move the rock.\"\n\"You?\" they shouted, \"What are you talking about?\" The men all _ at the boy.\nThe next morning some people came into the street. One of them shouted, \"The rock is _ !\" More people ran out to see. It was right. The rock wasn't in the road any more. It wasn't _ near the road.\n\"This is _ ,\" they said, \"Where did it go?\"\nThe boy stood in the street, _ , \"I told you I could move it last night.\"\nThe boy walked over to where the _ had been and uncovered some earth. \"I buried it,\" he said.\nThe people looked _ . \"You see,\" he said, \" I dug a deep hole next to the rock and I dug a small incline  up to the rock and the rock _ down into the hole by itself. I covered it with earth.\"\nThe crowds shouted, \"What a _ boy!\" And some of them said, \"Why haven't we thought of this good _ ?\"",
