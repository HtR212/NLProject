It has much more fun now.\" Other members of them of the team are as  _  as Chang Tong. A driver named Mao Lixin was saved from serious situation . One night, two men  _  his taxi and told him to drive them to a far-away place. During the drive, they wanted to go to different  places  many times. Mao was afraid that  something bad  would happen and sent a message for help. Some member drivers got the  _  , and they drove close to Mao to follow his car. At last two men got out of the car without  _  him any money, but nothing else happened. When one driver is in need of help,  others  from all across the city will give him or her a hand.
