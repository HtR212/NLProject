Anyhow, not wasting electricity save money, because we do not have to pay for the electricity we do not use.\nThe second thing that we often waste is water. Fresh water is precious , _ it shouldn't be wasted.It is only a simple matter of turning off a tap*. I am sure _ can do this easily if he wants to.\n Another big waste is food. My mother used to cook so much food that much of it was thrown away. I told her we had wasted so much _ . She thought I was right and now cooks  _ what we can eat.\nIt is not _ to be wasteful. I find there is a simple _ of not wasting things. That is to use only what we _ . Do not touch what we do not need. _ this way we can stop being wasteful.",
