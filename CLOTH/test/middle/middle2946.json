    "article": "I went to the supermarket with my kids last weekend. On the way, we found a man holding a piece of paper that said, \"Lost my job. Family to feed.\"\nAt this store, a sight like this is not normal. My 10-year-old kid noticed him and thought how bad it must be to have to stand _ in the cold wind.\nIn the store, I asked each of my kids to _ something they thought our \"friend\" would _ . They got apples, a sandwich and a bottle of juice. Then my 17-year-old kid suggested giving him a gift card. We were low on cash   ourselves, but sometimes giving from our need is _ what we need to do! All the kids declared   something they could do away with (, ) for the week.\nWhen we handed him the bag of _ , he cheered up and thanked us with watery eyes. When I handed him the gift card, saying he could use it for _ his family might need, he burst into tears.\nThis has been a wonderful _ for our family. For days the kids have been looking for others we can _ ! Things will happen so differently if I simply say, \"No, we really have no _ to give more.\" Stepping out not only helped a person in need, it also gave my kids the _ taste of helping others. It'll go a long way with them.",
