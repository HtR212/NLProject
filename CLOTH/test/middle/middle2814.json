    "article": "Dear Aunt Kate,\nThank you very much for inviting me  to stay  with you for a week in summer holiday. It's very kind  _  you. I always like staying at your home in the countryside because it is so  _  there. In Shanghai, our house is near Hongqiao Airport. Planes often fly right over us, so it is very _  sometimes. And there is also a factory near our house, and that  _  a lot of noise, too.\nI am sure I will have a good time there.\n _  is Uncle John? I believe he is feeling a little  better now. We were very sorry to hear about his  _ , I have drawn a picture for him and I  will bring  it with me when I visit you. Mother and Father send him their best wishes, and I  hope  he will soon be well..",
