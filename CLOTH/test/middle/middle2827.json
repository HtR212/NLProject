    "article": "Many people like eating bread and milk with an egg for breakfast. I don't like eating  _  at all. But it was today that I thought bread delicious for the first time.  Thinking  that I had much homework to do this afternoon, I had lunch very quickly and went to school  in a hurry  , But unluckily, I left the money on the desk, which I would use to pay for  supper  . At about 5:20, all the students left the classroom. Some went home for supper,  others  just went to the shop to have some fast food. My home is far from school. I  used to  buy something in the shop. But just when I put my hand into my pocket, I found that my money wasn't there. I remembered that I  had left  it at home. What should I do? I was too shy and I never borrowed money  _  my classmates. I had to go back to the classroom. \"It won't matter much if I don't have supper. I can have water  instead of  food.\" I thought. I drank two glasses of water. Now I was full. I was sure that I would feel  _  better. But I was wrong. After a short while, I felt even hungrier than before. \"  _  can I spend the three hours this evening?\" I tried to put all my effort into study and forget the food. But I couldn't keep on doing my homework as I was too  _  . I tied the belt tighter. And I  seemed  much better. How I wish the time could run more quickly! The evening classes were over at 9:30. I wanted to ride my bike  _  , but I couldn't. Twenty minutes later, I got home. I found a piece of dry bread on the table. I couldn't wait  to eat it up  though I don't like eating bread at all. What delicious food! Just as my mother says, \"The food that is eaten when you are hungry always tastes delicious!\"",
