One day he saw a baby elephant near the river. \"Hey, baby elephant, you are so  _  , and you'll never catch me.\" said the monkey. \"  _  do you have to laugh at me?\" the baby elephant asked. \"I  _  make trouble or make anyone upset.\" \"It's so fun.\" said the monkey. The monkey  went away  , jumping from tree to tree. Then he saw a turtle  _  with his mouth open. The monkey thought it would be a lot of fun putting his finger  _  the turtle's mouth. He did so,  _  the turtle shut his mouth just at that time. The monkey shouted  in pain  .The nice turtle woke up and let the monkey go. The monkey climbed up a tree and shouted all the way.",
