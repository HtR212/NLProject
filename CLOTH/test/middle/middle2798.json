Tom was  _  with his father's idea.\"That isn't my job. I have  too much  school work to do.\" Hearing this, his father said, \"I promise to give you the best present if you  _  finish one year's work.\" Tom thought for a while and  _  . Starting one Saturday, the boy got up early and worked hard until evening, just like  any other  farmer. Time passed quickly. Tom's crops grew well.  _  the last day of the year, the father called his son to him. \"I'm happy to see that you have worked very hard the whole year,\" said the father. \"Now, tell me  _  you want.\" The boy smiled and showed his father a big piece of bread  made from  his wheat. I've already got the best present: No pain, no gain. I think this is what you wanted me to know.\" His father was  _  to hear that.",
