    "article": "Middle school days are both fun and busy. Students spend their days in class, listening to the interesting and sometimes  boring words of the teachers. They spend the _ breaks running, playing, and shouting happily before going back to the classroom again. But _ should students spend their free time outside school?\nIn Western countries, it is ordinary for students to have a part-time job after school and at weekends. Students can make their own _ and learn more about the \"real world\". They enjoy the independence( ) and of course money, and parents enjoy the quiet house.\n _ , it seems that, in China, parents _ so much about their children's studies that they would prefer to see their children _ most of their free time studying and preparing for all those _ . It is natural for _ to feel that way in China, but I believe the answer lies in balance. Sometimes, Western school children work _ hours after school to make money, and so they become too tired to listen in class or have no time for homework. But Chinese students spend _ much time _ their studies that all else becomes less important until they want that new MP4 player.\nSo, find a good and healthy balance! If you have a part-time job, you'll be _ , and your parents will also be happy _ you're spending the money you make and not theirs!",
