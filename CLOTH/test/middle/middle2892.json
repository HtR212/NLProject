    "article": "The Magic of Waving\nIt began a year ago, around Christmas.\nWhile driving around the corner of our townhouse sports center, I always noticed an old man sitting by his front yard.He was usually smoking or drinking and looked grumpy  .\nOne day, while I was driving past him with my daughter, I decided to _ at him with a lot of excitement.At the beginning, when he noticed me waving at him, he looked a bit shocked .Then, I saw his _ go up and he waved back.\n\"Why did you wave at him?\" my daughter asked.\nI told her that it was just an act of kindness that didn't _ anything, and it gave both him and me a sense of joy.She responded by saying that she was a bit embarrassed   to wave to a _ , but next time she would try it as well.\nLucky for us, we lived close to the old man, so we _ him rather often.Whenever we drove by, both of us would wave at him and, pretty soon, the old man _ waving at everyone who passed by his house.\nOne day, my daughter's friend came to visit and she told my daughter that she saw this strange old man near our home who waved at her very _ .She mentioned that she waved back at him, even though she didn't know him, and that it felt really good.\nUpon hearing this, my daughter told her friend the story of how all the waving began.\nHer friend responded, \"Tell your mom that's really _ !\"\nOther friends made similar comments , and this response taught my daughter just how much an act of kindness can be very natural and effortless, if you really want to do it.It showed us how giving happiness _ both the giver andthereceiver.\nInspired by all these positive effects, we're planning to give our elder waving neighbor a thank-you card, to express our thanks for the warmth that he communicated through his enthusiastic waves.And to thank him for _ this simple joy with all who pass by his house.",
