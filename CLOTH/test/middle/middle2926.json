    "article": "The world is divided into two parts. One half of the world is rich and the _ half is poor. In the poor part, a lot of people _ get enough to eat. When they are ill, none of the hospitals can _ them because they have no money. In the rich part, a lot of people eat too much. For example, a dog _ a cat in North America eats better than a child in the poorer countries. The poor countries have some _ problems. Sometimes the land is too poor to grow  _ on. People there have neither rich land nor enough water. The land can be made better,  _ a lot of things must be done. The people must be taught and water must be found.\nBut rich countries have _  too. There are not always good places to live in. Sometimes the air is not clean and the rivers are too _ to swim in or to drink. The roads and streets are full of people and buses. Cars and buses have to move _ . There is too much noise. Something must be done about these problems. The air and the rivers must be cleaned and be kept clean. More houses have to be built. But these can't be done easily.",
