    "article": "As an American writer, Mark Twain, once said, \" Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody  _  anything about it.\" It is true that everybody talks about the weather. Many people begin their talks _  saying:\" Isn't it a nice  _ ?\" \" Do you think it will rain?\" \"I think it's going to snow.\"\nMany people think they can tell  _  the weather is going to be like. But they  _  ever agree with each other. One man may say, \"Do you see how cloudy it is in the east? It's going to rain tomorrow.\" Another man  _  say, \" Yes, it's cloudy in the east. We are going to have fun weather tomorrow.\"\nPeople often look for the weather they want. When a farmer needs water, he looks for something to tell him it's going to rain and he won't believe _  else. When friends have a picnic, they are so  _  the weather is going to be fine very  _  that they still sit eating their lunch while it is raining.\nAlmost everyone listens to what the weatherman says. But he doesn't always tell us what we want, and sometimes he makes a mistake. Still he is  right  most of the time.",
