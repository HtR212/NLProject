    "article": "During my second year of middle school, our teacher gave us a test. I studied hard and  _  well in all the subjects, so the questions were not difficult for me.  _  I stopped when I read the last one: \"What is the  _  of the woman that cleans the school?\" Of course this was a joke. I saw the cleaning woman every day. She was short and about 60 years old. She had dark hair. But  _  would I know her name? I had never talked with her before. In fact, I had never even thought  _  talking to her. I started to feel rather guilty. Finally, I  handed in  my paper, without finishing the last question. Before the class ended, one student asked, \"Will the last question count toward  _  grade?\" \" Of course,\" the teacher said. \" In your life, you will meet many people. All are important. They deserve your attention and care, even if you just  _  and say hello to them.\" I've  _  forgotten that lesson. I should get to know all of the people who work and live around me. That was, perhaps, the most  _  lesson of my life. Later, I learned that the cleaning woman's name was Dorothy.",
