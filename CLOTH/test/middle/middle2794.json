    "article": "The first way to make friends is to smile. When you smile, people think you are  _  and easy to talk to. It may not be easy at first to smile. But, you can practice in the mirror . When you look at yourself, think if you'd like to  _  to your smiling face or your usual face. Of course the smiling face. Most people stay away from an  _  face. One easy way to start a conversation with someone is to say  _  nice about them. For example, you could talk about an interesting  _  to a teacher's question, good match at the ball field, pretty shirt, etc.... Think about how great you feel when someone says something nice to you. Doesn't it make you want to  _  talking to that person? Ask your new friends questions about themselves. Such as: \"Who's their favorite singer?\" \"Where do they live, who's their teacher?\" \"What do they do after school?\" ... etc. They are all good questions to start a  _  . When someone asks you a question, do have an answer for them. If you don't  _  who your favorite singer is, or what your hobbies are, think about it. There's nothing that will  _  a conversation quicker than a shrug for an answer. Shy kids often have some trouble with complements. When someone says something nice, shy kids often say nothing. This leaves the other person  _  if they said something wrong. The best and easiest reply to a complement is a simple \"thank you\".",
