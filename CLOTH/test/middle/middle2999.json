    "article": "My earliest memory of dad is grabbing his hand while we walked together. As I  _  older, I remembered my father and I listened to many basketball games on the radio. I always fell asleep  _  the game was over. When I woke up in the morning, the score sheet with the  _  score on it would be lying next to me. I'll always remember that. On cold mornings my father would drive his bread truck by the house. I used to ride on the floor of that bread truck as he delivered the bread to the stores. The  _  and the warmth from the bread made me hungry and kept me warm. I'll always remember that. My father would attend all my games. One night before an important game my father told me  _  that he wouldn't be able to watch the game because he had to deliver the bread and it was a three-hour  _  from his route. The next day as the game time drew near, I thought about my dad. I happened to look across the field and  _  saw his bread truck pulling into the stadium. He tried to make the game. I'll always remember that. Years later I became a teacher. I'll never forget the voice on the phone early one morning telling me dad had just been killed in a traffic accident. I could hear my heart beat in my ears. I  _  up the phone and went back to my bedroom. After that nothing was very important to me. One day I was on the playground when a little boy walked up to me and grabbed my hand. His hand held mine the  _  way I used to hold my father's by the last two fingers. At that moment I found my  _  in life again. You see even though my father was gone, he left something with me. He left me his smile, spirit and touch. My purpose was to use those gifts as he did. From that day I started. I'll always remember that!",
