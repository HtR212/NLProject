    "article": "It is autumn. A strong wind is blowing. It _ flower seeds  high in the air. One of the seeds is tiny. Will it be able to keep up _ the others? Finally the wind stops and seeds fall quietly down on the ground.\nNow it is _ . After a long trip the seeds feel very _ . They look just as if they are going to sleep in the earth. Snow falls and covers them like a soft white blanket.\nSpring comes. It gets warm. The sun shines. Rain falls. The seeds grow so full and round that they start to break open a little. Now they are not _ . They are plants. First they put roots   into the earth. Then their little stems   and leaves begin to dance in the sun and air.\nIn summer, the tiny plant is all alone. It grows on and doesn't stop. The sun shines on it _ the rain waters it. It has many leaves. It grows taller and taller. It is taller than the people. It is taller than the trees. And now some flowers grow on it.\nAutumn comes back. The wind blows past the flowers. _ petals   drop over the land and down to the ground. The wind blows harder. The flowers have lost all of their petals. Once more the wind shakes the flowers, and this time the flowers' seed pods   open. Many new seeds come out. Quickly in the wind they are on the way to new plants again.",
