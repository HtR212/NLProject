    "article": "In the middle of a forest there was a little tree standing among many big trees. He was very  _  at not being as big as the others. When the birds flew into the forest and  _  their houses, he used to say to hem, \"Come  _  and have a rest in my body!\" But the birds always said, \"Oh, no. You're too small!\" The worst part was when people came to choose trees, they would pass him by  _  he was too small. The other trees said that when they were taken away by people, they might be  made into  the mast of a large ship, go far away from the  _  , and see many wonderful things; or they  _  become part of a fine house in a great city, and experience life there. All these were just dreams to the little tree. One cold  _  morning, some people came searching the forest. \"There are  _  that are little enough,\" they said. \"Here is one,\" said one man. \"It's just the right  _  .\" And he chose the little tree. The little tree was very happy because he knew they were about to take  _  away. Later all kinds of beautiful things were  _  all over him. The children all said, \"  _  beautiful!\" \"It's the  _  Christmas tree we've ever seen!\"  _  , the little tree knew what he was. He was a Christmas tree! He was just little enough to be the nicest Christmas tree in the world!",
