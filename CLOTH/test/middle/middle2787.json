Because their parents do almost everything for them at home. This is a big problem. Joy is 14 years old. One day her parents went away  _  business, so she had to stay at home alone. At first she thought she would be happy  _  her parents were not in. She could do everything  _  she liked. But it was six o'clock in the afternoon, she felt  _  . \"Oh, it's time to have supper. Where can I get my food?\" she said to herself. Later she found some food in the fridge, but she  didn't  know how to cook. At that moment, she missed her  _  very much. At last she could only go to the supermarket and  _  some food to eat. Many of teenagers are  the same  as Joy. So I think they should learn some basic life skills, like cooking, tidying up their rooms or dressing themselves  _  . They shouldn't depend too much on their parents.",
