Just before that I had dropped off a bag of clothes and a few other things I no longer needed.\nThe couple moved _ around me in search of things they had on a list.\n\"Can I help you _ something?\" I asked curiously.\nThey stopped, looked at me and said, \"We're looking for _ things that look new.\"\n\"Every year in the past, we tried to _ the year with new things. It was a goal   to have new things around us so that we had a new _ , new hopes and dreams for the new year,\" said the old man. \"But nowadays we also believe that even though something is old, it _ be new to someone who has never seen it before.\"\n\"So, at the end of each year we search for things that are _ to no one but new to us,\" the old woman added.\n\"What have you found so far?\" I asked.\nThe man showed two things: a small frame made of sticks and one baby boot.\n\"We still need one more thing,\" he said.\n\"Got it!\" I heard a loud _ .\n\"What did you find?\" the old man shouted, too.\nThe old woman walked slowly towards us _ something in her hand. \"Look! It's a flower vase. Well, it looks _ , but it's new to us!\"\nThey then headed for the checkout without saying another word.\nEverything that you see for the first time is new.",
