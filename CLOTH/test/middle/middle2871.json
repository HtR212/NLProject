Perhaps you even feel sorry about taking time for yourself -  after all  , shouldn't you  _  that time with your kids, or your spouse , or your parents? We all need time  to rest  and recharge. If life feels  _  busy that you believe you can't manage to have a few hours for  _  , then it's especially important that you make some \"me time\". You Need to Take Care of Your Health If you run yourself into the ground, you're not going to be much help to the people around you. You need to  _  yourself that your health is important. Good physical and mental health requires care of your body, mind and soul. You Want Space to Breathe and Think If your life is starting to  feel like  a treadmill , it's time to stop. When you're in the thick of things, it's hard to get more ideas. Perhaps you're struggling with a particular decision - like a  _  of jobs, or the chance to take an important qualification . It can be all too easy to put off decisions or make hurried choices if you don't take the time  to stop  and think. You Are Important Too Sometimes, we put other people first because we're secretly convinced that they're  more important.  , or more needy than us. We don't care about our own needs-  in order to  help them. Perhaps you've got a relative who's ill, or a friend  _  facing huge struggles in his life, but don't forget that you are important too. No matter  _  busy you are, you can find time for yourself -  even though  you have to start with just a few minutes each day, or an hour or two every weekend. What could you do this week to make more breathing space in your life?",
