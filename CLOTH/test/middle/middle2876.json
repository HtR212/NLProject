As we walked towards the entrance to the restaurant, a man, with a messy beard and  _  hair, jumped up from a bench outside the restaurant and opened the door for us. Paying no attention to his  _  , he greeted us in a friendly way.

Just then, the \"doorman\"was opening the door for a couple. They  rushed past  him without even noticing his presence. Letting them in first, I said a loud \"thank you\" to  _  as I went out. When I returned, we talked a bit. He said he was not allowed inside  _  he bought food. I went back and asked our waitress to  _  one soup and sandwich.

Back in the car, I fell into deep thought. While we can't choose many things in life, we can choose  _  to show gratitude.
