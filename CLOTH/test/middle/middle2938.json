    "article": "My life is always full of sadness and little joy. However, no matter what happens, I can always face it bravely. Last year, I couldn't believe the  _  that I could enter the only key high school in my hometown. Then I rushed to my home and told my parents. But my father didn't seem as  _  as I was. He just kept smoking without saying a word and my mother put her head down and couldn't help  _  . I knew very well what my family was  _  . My mum had been ill in bed for 2 years. We lived a hard life and I couldn't continue my schooling. I felt so upset but I could say  _  to my parents. I decided to help my father with his work  to support  my family. To my surprise, things completely changed  _  the beginning of the new term. My head teacher came to my family  _  some money, which was raised by my schoolmates. He encouraged me, \"Always have a dream.\" With tears in my eyes, I stepped into the key high school. I have been studying hard since I entered the high school. No matter when I meet difficulties, I always  think of  my teacher and schoolmates. I have a college dream and I must work hard for it, no matter how  _  life is. Just as a great man says, \"When one door shuts, another opens in life.\"",
