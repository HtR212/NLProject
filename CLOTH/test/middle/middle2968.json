We must learn how to change these \"problems\" into \"challenges\". _ is an important part of our development. As young adults, _ is our duty  to try our best to deal with each challenge in our education _ the help of our teacher.\nBy comparing yourself to other people, you will find your problems are not so terrible. Think about Stephen Hawking, for example, a very clever scientist _ regards his many physical  problems as unimportant. He can't walk or even speak _ he has become very famous and successful. We are probably quite healthy and smart. Let's not worry about our problems. Let's face the challenges Instead .",
