He opened his bag to take a drink. He noticed that lady looked  _  , so he offered her a piece of cake. She accepted and smiled at him. Her  _  was so wonderful that he wanted to see it again. Then he offered her a can of coke. Once again she smiled at him. The boy was pleased! They  _  there all afternoon, eating and drinking without saying a word.  _  it began to grow dark, the boy got up to leave, but before he had gone no more than a few steps, he turned around , ran  _  to the old woman and gave her a big hug . She gave him her biggest smile. When the boy arrived home, his mother was  _  by the look of joy on his face. She asked, \"What has made you so happy today?\" He  _  , \" I had lunch with God. She's got the most beautiful smile in the world!\" And when the old woman returned to her home, she told her son that she had lunch with God.
