Some dog--owners don't take care of their dogs well enough,and they let their dogs make mess on the roads and in gardens, This makes the environment  _  .I would like to tell the dog--owners  _  their behavior is too bad,and at the same time they are making people feel unhappy.We should keep the environment  _  . It is reported that some people  _  rubbish out of the windows.It is dangerous because falling objects  may  hurt others.It is against the law.We should put up a notice to teach people not to do so.If it is found,we will record the names and address of those people who throw objects.Then,a warning will be given and  _  will be punished by law. A safe and comfortable living environment is important to us.  _  we try our best to carefor our community,it will be a good place to live in.Thank you for your coming.",
