Music has always been a great love of mine and, in my 20s, when my  _  was more manageable , I  _  ten years as a professional singer in restaurants, playing and singing folk songs.  _  that was years ago and times have changed.  _  I live with mother on a country farm. Two years ago, I decided that I would need to have some kind of extra work to make up for my disability pension .  _  I needed to sleep in the afternoons, I was limited in my choices. I decided that I would consider  going back  to singing in restaurants. My family are all musicians, so I was  _  when I went into our local music store. I explained that I wanted to sing again but using recorded karaoke music. I knew that discs were very expensive and I really didn't have a lot of  _  to get started. And often you find only three to four songs out of ten on a disc that you can  _  use. When I told the owner of the shop about my  _  ; he gave me a long thoughtful  _  . \"This means a lot to you, doesn't it?\" he said. \"Come with me.\" He led me  _  the crowded shop and to a bench with a large professional karaoke box on it. He placed his large hand  _  on his treasure and said, \"I have 800 karaoke songs in here. You can take your pick and I'll record them for you. That should get you started.\" I could have cried. Thanking him, I made a time with him to listen to all the songs and choose  the ones  that I could sing. I have come full circle with his help. His  _  still warms my heart and makes me do just that bit extra, when I have the chance.",
