So the doctor called the old lady who cleaned the office floors , and said to the rich lady,\"I'm going to ask Mary to tell you how she found  _  . All I want you to do is to listen.\" So the old lady put down her broom ,sitting on a chair to tell her  _  ,\"Well ,my husband  died of  malaria ( ) and months later my only son was killed by a car . I had nobody ... I had nothing  _  . I couldn't sleep; I couldn't eat ; I never smiled at anyone; I  _  thought of the death . Then one evening a little cat  _  me home from work . I felt sorry for the cat . It was cold outside , so I decided to let the cat in . I got it some milk , and it licked( ) the plate  _  . Then it rubbed against my leg , and for the first time in months, I smiled . Then I stopped to think : if  _  a cat could make me smile , maybe doing something for  _  could make me happy ,too . So the next day I baked( )some biscuits and took them to a neighbor who was  _  in bed. Every day I tried to do something  _  for someone . It made me so happy to see them happy . Today I don't  _  of anybody who sleeps and eats better than I do . I've found happiness by  _  it to others . \" When she heard that , the rich lady cried . She had everything that money could buy ,but she had  _  the things which money couldn't buy .",
