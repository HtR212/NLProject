    "article": "One afternoon, my son Adam asked me, \"Are all people the same even though they are different in color?\"\nIt was a serious question. I _ for a while, and then said, \"I'll explain it sooner. Let's go to a fruit shop. I have something interesting to show you.\"\nAt the fruit shop, we bought some apples in different _ --red, green and yellow ones. After we got home, I told Adam, \"It's time to _ your question now.\" I put one apple of each kind colour on the table. Adam _ carefully. He had a _ look on his face.\n\"People are like apples. They come in all different colors, shapes and sizes. On the _ , some of the apples may not even look as delicious as the others .\" While I was talking, Adam was _ each one carefully. Then, I took each of the apples and peeled  them, placing them back on the table , but in a different place.\n\"Okay, Adam, tell me which is which.\"\nHe said, \"I _ tell. They all look the same now.\"\n\"Take a _ of each one. See if that helps you decide _ one is which.\"\nHe took big bites, and then a huge smile came across his face. \"People are _ like apples! They are all different, but once you take off the outside, they're pretty much the _ on the inside.\"\nHe totally _ it. I didn't need to say or do anything else.",
