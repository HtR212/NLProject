    "article": "What will you do to make sure you reach your goals? There are  _  main steps . First, sit down and  _  your dreams out. By writing them you will get a better idea of where you really want to go. Imagine yourself at the end of the year or maybe  _  five years. What do you see?  _  do people see you? What are you doing? Are you  _  ? Well, a dream is just that. It's a vision of how you  _  yourself in the future. As long as you know the direction in which you want to go, you can begin  working on  some goals.  _  come the goals. Goals are 'wants'. So are dreams, but goals are more specific . If you want to be rich, tell how much  _  you need to be rich. If you want  _  grades, tell what you mean by 'good'. In fact, the more specific the goal is, the  _  it will be to get it. Give numbers and times. Don't use words like 'lots' or 'more'.  For example  , I want a 'B' in each of my subjects. Third are the objectives . They tell  _  what you will do and when you will do it. When you think about what you will do, don't use words like '  _  ' or 'maybe'. Be sure your objectives can be measured . Every day or every week you can ask, 'Did I  _  this?' and you can answer with either a yes or a no. Don't leave room for 'maybes'.",
