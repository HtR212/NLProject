She  _  told us not to be late for the bus, not to be late for school, and so on. \" Don't be late\" became our family rule. Mother  _  as a teacher when my twin brother and I started the first grade. Every school day morning, she called us to get up, and cooked  _  breakfast. School started at 8:00 am,  _  we arrived at the school before 7:30 am each school day morning. When we were in high school, our  _  once told my mother that we had been late for three times in one month. That made my mother so  _  that she beat us. After that I was not late for anything. I kept the  _  of being on time for a long time. When I  _  a teacher, we were asked to get to school at 8;00 am, but I always got there at 7;15 am. That gave me more time to do my job  _  .
