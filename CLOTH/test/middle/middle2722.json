If we read newspapers, we'll learn that the forests on the earth are getting smaller  all the time  . We are cutting down large numbers of trees  _  we need wood and farmland. Some scientists say that there will not be any great forests  _  20 or 30 years. What will happen if the forests disappear? A lot of plants will die and the animals will  _  their homes. In many places the new farmland will soon look  _  the old desert. Crops will not grow there. There won't be enough  _  , and the weather will get hot and dry. If the climate of the earth changes, life will be  _  for everyone. Our living environment will become  worse and worse  . More and more rich farmland will disappear. We will suffer a lot from both droughts and floods. It's our duty  to protect  the forests well. Everyone should try his best to make a contribution to taking care of the forests. Stop cutting down the trees and make the world greener!",
