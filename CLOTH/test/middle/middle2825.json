They worked hard all year round,  _  still, they lived a hard life and sometimes they even didn't have enough  _  to buy food. The swan was  _  to see that. She said to herself, \"I'll give one of my  feathers  to them each day, then they can live a happy life with the money selling my feathers.\" That evening, she  _  to the poor woman's house and left a golden feather on the table without saying  _  . From then on, the swan came every day and gave them a feather. The woman was very happy because their life was much  _  than before. But day after day, the woman became greedy .She said to her  _  . \"The swan may fly away one day. If so, we will be poor again. We should take all  _  feathers if she comes next time.\" \"Oh, no, Mom!\" cried the daughters, \"This will  _  the swan. She helps us a lot!\" But the mother wouldn't listen. When the  _  came as usual, the mother caught her and took all her feathers. But suddenly, the golden feathers  changed into  chicken feathers. Then, the Golden Swan said, \"Poor Mother, I came to  _  you, but you wanted to kill me. Now, I am leaving and will  _  come back. Never be greedy!\" With these words, the swan left.",
