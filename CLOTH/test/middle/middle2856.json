    "article": "We spent a day in the country and picked a lot of flowers. Our car was  _  of flowers inside!  _  the way home we had to stop at traffic lights, and there my wife saw the bookshelf. It stood outside a furniture shop. \"Buy it,\" she said at once. \"We'll carry it home on the roof-rack . I've always wanted  _  like that.\" What could I do? Ten minutes  _  I was twenty dollars poorer, and the bookshelf was tied on to the roof-rack. It was tall and narrow, quite heavy  _  . As it was  _  darker, I drove slowly. Other drivers seemed more polite than usual that evening. The police even stopped traffic to let  _  through. Carrying furniture was a good idea. After a time my wife said, \"There  _  a long line of cars behind. Why don't they overtake ?\" Just at that time a police car did overtake. The two police officers looked at us seriously when they went past.  _  then, with  _  kind smile they asked us to follow their car through the busy  _  . The police car stopped at our village church. One of the officers came to me. \"Right, sir,\" he said. \"Do you need any more help now?\" I didn't quite understand. \"Thanks, officer,\" I said. \"You've  _  very kind. I live just down the road.\" He was looking at our things: first at the flowers,  _  at the bookshelf. \"Well, well,\" he said and laughed. \"It's a bookshelf you've got there! We thought it was  _  else.\" My wife began to laugh. Suddenly I understood  _  the police drove here. I smiled at the officer. \"Yes, it's a bookshelf, but thanks again.\" I drove home as fast as I could.\"",
