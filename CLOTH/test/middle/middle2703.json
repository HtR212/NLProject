    "article": "One night, I was sitting in my kitchen half listening as my 15-year-old brother Tommy fought with my 12-year-old brother Kevin. I didn't pay attention when Kevin rushed up the stairs with the hurt on his face. About 20minutes later, as I was walking upstairs I heard Kevin crying inside the  _  . I knocked on the door and asked, \"Hey Kev, do you want to talk?\" No answer. I tried again, \"Hey, why don't you come out of there?\" Again, no answer. So I took a stack of cards and a pencil and wrote, \"If you don't want to  _  , we can write notes to each other.\" An hour later I was  _  sitting on the floor outside the bathroom with two stacks of cards in front of me. One was blank and the other was cards  _  Kevin on which he had translated all his unpleasant feelings into words for me.  _  I read one of Kevin's notes, tears came to my eyes. It said, \"  _  in this family cares about me, I'm not clever. Tommy thinks I'm a fool and Dad wishes he had the other Kevin as a kid because he's better at basketball. And you're never around to even  _  me.\" Tears came to my eyes as I wrote back to him. It was  _  what he had said about me. I wrote back, \"You know Kev, I really do love you and I'm sorry I don't always show it to you. I am here for you and you are  _  in this family.\" There was no answer for a while, but then I heard a tearing sound coming from inside the bathroom. Kevin, who had  run out of  cards wrote on a torn-up paper cup, \"Thanks.\" I wrote back \"For what?\" It returned to me with \"loving me\" written on it. Since then, I try my best to  _  half notice my family members any more. Kevin and I have a closer  _  now, and sometimes when one of us notices that the other is upset we'll smile and say \"Write it on a paper cup.\"",
