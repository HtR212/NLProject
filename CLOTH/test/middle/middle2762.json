He thought that hours of playing and  _  jokes was not enough - he wanted to show how he understood the hard time he was going through. Five-year-old Vincent decided the only way was to shave his head to support his best friend Zac Gossage who lost his  _  through chemotherapy . When the little boy  was asked  why he shaved his hair off, he answered, \"To make Zac feel like he's not the only one  _  any hair.\" Vincent has also been learning about cancer and raising money  to help  his best friend after learning how  _  his treatments are. He made over 20  _  and sold them, raising more than $200 to give to Zac. The little boy's mom Karen Butterfield said, \"We have been making more scarves and it would be cool if we could sell them  _  . \" When people asked him  _  friendship was like, Vincent looked at his friend Zac and replied, \"It's a beautiful thing. Friends always  cheer up  each other.\"",
