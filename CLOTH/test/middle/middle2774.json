    "article": "I can't remember when I started collecting litter. But it was when I got tired of  _  litter nearby and realized that no one else was going to pick it up. I live  near  a forest in Ohio, America. I can walk there  _  three minutes.I used to love going there to play with my dog. But one day there was  _  much litter there that I became very unhappy. I decided I had to clean up the forest. I wanted to  _  happy going there again. I  _  my first trip to clean the forest that afternoon. I took a big black rubbish bag with me. Ten minutes  _  starting to pick up litter, my bag was full! It had cans,  bottles  , broken glass and newspapers in it. From then on, I  went  to the forest four times a year to pick up litter. I'm often there for three hours. It makes me feel  _  to do something for the environment. After each trip, I look at all the litter that I've found. If  _  of it is recyclable, I keep it. I  _  understand why people drop litter. But I will keep picking it up  until  they stop  dropping  it.I know I am only doing a small bit  to help  the Earth, but I still think it is important.",
