He went to a piano school in Beijing when he was just eight. \"You need fortune , \" his father said. \"But  _  you work hard, no fortune will come.\" What made him sad was that his piano teacher in Beijing didn't like him. \"You have no  _  .You will never be a pianist.\" As an eight-year-old boy, Lang Lang was badly  _  . He decided that he didn't want to be a pianist any more. For the next two weeks, he didn't touch the piano. Wisely, his father didn't  _  , but waited. Luckily the day came when his teacher asked him to play some holiday songs. He didn't want to, but as he placed his fingers on the piano keys, he  _  he could show other people that he had ability to do it well. That day he told his father that he wanted to  _  with a new teacher. From that point on, everything turned around. He started  _  competitions in the 1994 International Young Pianists Competition. When it was announced that Lang Lang had won, he was too  _  to hold back his tears. Soon it was clear that he couldn't stay in China forever--he had to play on the world's big stages. In 1997 Lang Lang  _  again, this time to Philadelphia, US. There he spent two years practicing and by 1999 he had worked hard enough for fortune to take over. After his  _  performance at Chicago's Ravinia Festival, gigs in Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall started pouring in. Lang Lang finally worked to reach the place where fortune spots him, and lets him shine.",
