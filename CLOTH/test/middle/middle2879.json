When he opened the door he saw a man  _  outside. \"Excuse me, Doctor,\"said the man. \"Can you come at once to a place out of town. It's quite far but you have a car and I can  _  you the way\" \"Certainly,\" said the doctor, \"I'm ready. I'll come soon.\"  _  few minutes, the car came. The man got into the car and they  _  off. They drove for a  _  time, and then the man said, \"Here we are. This is my home. Now I can pay you and you can go  _  to town.\" \"But I must  see  the patient,\" the doctor said. \"Where's the patient?\"\"There's  _  patient,\" answered the man. \"Nobody is ill. I live here, you see, and I must  _  ome from the town. There are no taxis at this time of the night. Here's the money for you. Thank you, doctor. Good  night  !",
