One day a _ teacher came to this school. When he heard that, he came up with a good idea. He told each of his students to bring a clear _ bag and a bag of potatoes to school.

They were told to carry this bag with them everywhere for one week. They would put it beside their _ at night, on the seat when they sit in a car or on a bus, and next to their desk at school. Days of carrying the bags around with them made students get to know what a weight they were _ in their minds. And they had to pay so much attention to it all the time that they didn't forget it or leave it in embarrassing  places. As time passed by, the potatoes went bad and made people feel _ .\nToo often we think of tolerance  as a gift to other people, and it clearly is for _ ! If we choose to keep our _ and hatred   in our hearts, we will have to carry them around all our lives. After that, the students got on well with each other and didn't fight any more. Learn to _ , and you will be happier at the same time.",
