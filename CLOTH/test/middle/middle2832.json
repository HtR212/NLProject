They carry  the people's  wishes to the families they love and miss. There are many  _  folk stories about this festival. However, most people think that the story of Chang'e is the most touching. Chang'e was Hou Yi's beautiful wife. After Hou Yi  shot down  the nine suns, a goddess gave him magic medicine to thank him. Whoever drank this could live forever, and Hou Yi planned to drink it with Chang'e. However, a bad man, Peng Meng, tried to steal the medicine when Hou Yi was not  at home  . Chang'e refused to give it to him and drank it all. She became very light and flew up to the moon. Hou Yi was  _  sad that he called out her name to the moon every night. One night, he found that the moon was so bright and round that he could see his wife there. He quickly  laid out  her favorite fruits and desserts in the garden.  How  he wished that Chang'e could come back! After this, people started the tradition of admiring  the moon  and sharing mooncakes with their families.",
