Other  people have poor memories and can't remember things  _ they have said them over and over again.\nThe famous English writer, Charles Dickens, said that he could walk down any long street in  _  and then tell you the names of all the shops he had  _ . Many great men of the world have wonderful memories.\nA good memory is a great help  in learning a language. Everybody learns  _  own language by remembering the things he heard when he was a small child. Some children like those who live in foreign countries with their parents, seem to learn two languages as  well  as they do one. In school it is not so easy for pupils to learn a second language because they have  very  little  time for it.\nMemory  is like a diary that we keep every day.",
